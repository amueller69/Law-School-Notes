# Criminal Procedure

## 4th Amendment: Searches and Seizures

### General Overview

> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. - U.S. Const., amend. IV.

* These protections are only applicable to government conduct
  * 4A protections generally do not extend to against acts of private individuals
    * Exception: **State action doctrine**
      * 4A might apply to acts of private individuals if they are attributable to the state (e.g., private party acting w/ government authority aka "under color of state law")
      * Some situations in which private party may be deemed a state actor include:
        * Where State has outsourced traditional government functions to the private party (e.g., private prisons, deputized private police)
        * Where there is a close operational relationship between state and the private party (so-called "symbiotic relationships" or "joint ventures")
        * Where party is acting under coercion/influence/encouragement from the state
        * Government is "pervasively entwined" with the leadership of a private organization
  * Incorporated against the states, as are all rights enumerated in the BoR, by the 14th Amendment
    * Hence 4A protections apply to actions taken by state/municipal law enforcement
* Standing - can only bring claims for violation of one's own constitutional rights (can't do so vicariously);
  * Not sure if this is always true? I think it is assumed to be true since nearly all cases involving claimed violations of constitutional rights are brought in federal court under federal question jurisdiction, thus they are subject to Article III standing requirements. However, this is still area of concurrent jurisdiction that could theoretically be heard in state court, many of whom have much more relaxed standing requirements.

* Standards

  * **Reasonable suspicion** - Knowledge of specific and articulable facts that would lead a reasonable person/officer to believe that criminal activity is occurring and requires further investigation
    * Lower standard than PC but more than just a hunch
  * **Probable cause** - Specific acts and circumstances, of which one has reliable information, that would lead a reasonable person to conclude there is a "substantial chance" or "fair probability" the individual in question is (about to be) engaged in criminal activity or that evidence of criminal activity can be found at a particular location
    * Needs to be specific and individualized (particular person/place/thing)
    * Knowledge of facts/circumstances is more concrete and reliable than reasonable suspicion
      * Need not be first-hand, but source must be trustworthy/reliable

### Searches

* A search is an invasion of a protected privacy interest; for a search to have occurred must be an **intrusion of a reasonable expectation of privacy or physical trespass to a protected  space** for the purpose of investigation
  * Questions about whether the law still recognizes the former (sometimes referred to as Trespass Doctrine) as a test for identifying 4th amendment interest; *Jones* suggests it is alive and well, while *Carpenter* declines to provide any further clarification
  * REP test has both objective and subjective test, but the latter is mostly ignored since it is assumes that individual expectations are shaped by societal ones
* Things that are not searches:
  * Things in plain view - plain sight observation by police from a place they are legally entitled to be is not a search
  * Open fields -  area outside a property owner's curtilage
  * Movements in public - tailing or areal surveillance (limited post-*Carpenter*)
  * Non-content/meta data possessed by third part (third-party doctrine)
  * Canine sniffs
* Anything the falls under the definition of "search" requires a search warrant supported by probable cause to be proper (unless it falls under one of the warrant exceptions detailed below)

### Seizures of Property

* A seizure of property is an act that invades/interferes with an individual's possessory interest in that property
  * This can consist of taking possession of the property (i.e., as evidence), destroying the property, preventing the property from being accessed
* Requires warrant (search warrant) supported by probable cause in order to be "reasonable" and thus steer clear of 4th Amendment violations
  * Seizures of property are really just an extension of searches

### Seizures of Persons

* Not all dealings with police are seizures; "Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a ‘seizure’ has occurred" - dictum in *Terry*
  * *Mendenhall* test for when seizure has occurred (objective) - person has been 'seized' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, **in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave**
  * Encounters w/ police were reasonable person would feel free to go at any time are are **not seizures** at all (lack show of force/coercion or authority); the extent these encounters occur can be characterized as **consensual**
    * Police can approach people, ask questions, request permission to search without any PC or reasonable suspicion (however, needs to be somewhat reasonable; can't go around arbitrarily harassing random citizens)
  * Even where there is use of force/coercion or show of authority, not considered a seizure unless person actually submits to it

* Seizure can either be an arrest or a detention short of arrest (aka "*Terry* stop")
  * This distinction is significant, as the former is subject to warrant requirement (w/ exceptions), whereas the later merely requires reasonable suspicion
  * Distinguished by level of coercion/intrusiveness, length of detention, whether seized person is moved to different location
  * Arrest - in formal arrest, person is taken into legal custody to be further questioned and/or charged with a crime
    * **Arrest in the home --> Requires PC AND a warrant** (absent exception)
    * **Arrest in public place --> Requires PC, but can be without warrant**
  * Detention short of arrest (aka *Terry* stops)
    * These still constitute seizures for 4A purposes (since person is not free to leave), but **only require reasonable suspicion**
    * Detention is brief and cursory, limited level of restraint/intrusiveness; reasonable person would feel free to leave after limited purpose of stop (brief questioning or pat down) is completed
    * Stops for questioning - temporarily detaining person for brief questioning in order to dispel the reasonable suspicion of ongoing/imminent criminal activity that is basis for the stop
    * **Stop-and-frisk**- brief detention for purpose of pat-down search of persons outer clothing;
      * Must be **reasonable suspicion of criminal activity AND that person is carrying weapon**
      * **Plain-feel doctrine** - if during pat-down, officer detects weapon OR other contraband based solely on its feel or from plain sight, it can be seized

### Warrants

* Valid search warrant:
  * States, with specificity, the **place to be searched and, with reasonable detail, the items to be searched/seized**
  * Signed and issue judge/magistrate after reviewing warrant application
    * Application for warrant accompanied by affidavit stating basis/justification for warrant that is being sought
* Challenges to validity of search warrants
  * Warrant is invalid where it relies on a faulty affidavit;
    * If D challenges warrant for lack of PC, court will only review whether there was "substantial basis" for magistrate's finding of PC UNLESS D can prove (by preponderance of evidence) that knowingly/recklessly included false statement of material fact, at which point it may be reviewed de novo
  * May also be challenged on grounds that it failed particularity requirements, that magistrate lacked requisite neutrality/detachment, or contained some other error
    * Good faith exception - where error on behalf of magistrate causes warrant to become invalid but police relied on its validity in good faith, evidence obtained through execution of this warrant might not be suppressed (these are warrants that would pretty much otherwise be valid)
* Execution of warrant - facial validity of warrant notwithstanding, search/seizure with warrant may be improper due to defects in the execution of warrant
  * Searches and seizures that exceed the warrant's scope of authorization, such as places/items not specified
    * **Plain view Doctrine** - however, even if item not specified in warrant, can be properly seized if item's incriminating nature is immediately apparent and observable from place within scope of warrant
  * Knock and announce - generally required to announce presence and give person enough time before breaching the place (unless exigent circumstances); however, failure to do this will not result in evidence being suppressed
  * Execution of search warrant caries with it implicit authorization to temporarily detain any persons present the place to be searched

### Exception to Warrant Requirement

* General note: any warrantless search or seizure is presumed to be unreasonable; burden is on the state to prove it falls under one of the exceptions

* **Search incident to arrest** - where police make lawful arrest (i.e., supported by PC), can perform warrantless search of person being taken into custody, seize any contraband/evidence of crime
  * This extends to suspect's so-called "**wingspan**" (areas within his reach) if there is reason to believe contraband **related to crime of arrest** might be found
    * If arrested in vehicle, this wingspan consist of front compartment, rear/passenger seats

* **Plain view Doctrine** - detailed earlier, item can be seized if it is plain view from place police are legally authorized to be and whose incriminating nature is immediately apparent (i.e., giving rise to PC)

* ***Terry* frisk** - detailed earlier, can perform warrantless pat-down search where reasonable suspicion of crime AND that suspect is armed/dangerous
  * Can extend to parts of vehicle (e.g., glove compartment) from which suspect could gain immediate control of weapon

* **Vehicle exception** - warrantless search is permissible where PC exists that a "readily mobile" (i.e., not a mobile home) vehicle has evidence of crime or other contraband located in it.
  * Unlike searches incident to arrest or Terry frisk of vehicles, authorizes complete search of vehicle (not just parts in immediate control)
  * However, once the evidence/contraband for which there is PC has been seized, cannot continue general search of vehicle

* **Exigent circumstances** - where circumstances make waiting for warrant impossible, warrantless search/entry may be allowed if there is PC
  * In hot pursuit of felon -  warrantless entry into otherwise protected area if fleeing suspect pursued into place (e.g., home) where arrest is made; once therein, items in plain view may be seized
  * Emergency situations - where, under "totality of circumstances" test, it is reasonably necessary to prevent physical harm or imminent destruction/removal of evidence

* **Consent** - must be given voluntarily and without coercion; person consenting can limit scope of authorization and withdraw it
  * Consent of third-party may also suffice where they share common authority over property with suspect (e.g., roommate, parent, but NOT hotel or landlord)

* **Inventory search** - Allows a warrantless search of impounded vehicle, without PC or RS, for purpose of inventorying contents; must be done pursuant to standard policies/procedures

### Exclusionary Rule

* Exclusionary rule is a judicially crafted that serves as a remedy for violations of 4th Amendment rights (among others), **preventing unlawfully obtained evidence from being introduced in criminal trial**, as well as a deterrent for prosecutors/law enforcement.
  * Does not apply in  civil case, grand jury proceedings, or in parole hearings
* Not only is illegally obtained evidence suppressed, but any derivative evidence--that which is only obtained as a result of the suppressed evidence--is also excluded in what is often referred to as the "**fruit of the poisonous tree**" doctrine
* **Exceptions**:
  * **Independent source rule** - Where evidence is discovered via source/measures independent from the violation (e.g., where strong PC already exists at the time of unconstitutional warrantless search, can go back and get a warrant, supported by initial PC, to obtain same evidence lawfully)
  * **Inevitable discovery** - Where discovery of the evidence was inevitable; it would have eventually been discovered absent the violation
  * **Attenuation principle** - where passage of time or intervening events attenuates the causal chain between the violation and derivative evidence such that the violation is not served by suppression
  * **Good faith exception** - As noted earlier, where there is good faith reliance on defective warrant (due to magistrate or other non-police error), evidence obtained is not suppressed
* Standing requirement - since exclusionary rule operates as remedy for individuals whose 4A rights are violated, the person seeking to invoke exclusionary rule must have actually had their rights violated
  * This means it cannot be used to suppress evidence obtained from an illegal search/seizure of a third-party
* Cross-examination - even where illegally-obtained evidence/statement is excluded, prosecution may, for purposes of impeachment (i.e., prior inconsistent statement, contradictory evidence), question D about it in cross-examination and potentially even introduce it as extrinsic evidence if D denies it
  * Remember: extrinsic evidence is not admissible when impeaching witness on collateral matters. If illegally obtained evidence is not relevant to material issue at trial, but only relevant insofar as it shows contradiction which damages credibility, can only inquire into it in cross-examination and must accept D's answer

The right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures must be distinguished from the remedy. The primary remedy is the “exclusionary rule,” which prevents the introduction at a subsequent criminal trial of evidence unlawfully seized. This remedy is judicially created, not constitutionally mandated. The remedy provided by the exclusionary rule generally applies to criminal trials; it does not apply in other court proceedings, including federal habeas corpus review of state convictions, grand jury proceedings, preliminary hearings, bail hearings, sentencing hearings, and proceedings to revoke parole. Evidence will also not be excluded at trial when introduced as impeachment evidence against the defendant. Finally, the exclusionary rule is not applicable to civil proceedings

## Confessions and Privilege Against Self-Incrimination

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury ... ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. - U.S. Const., amend. V.

### Privilege Against Self-Incrimination

* Only protect persons from compulsory disclosure of testimonial evidence
  * **Testimonial evidence** - the substantive content of one's mind as expressed through words; this does NOT include things like standing in a police lineup, reciting some words for purpose of voice recognition, submitting to some sort of test (e.g., handwriting, urine, blood, breathalyzer, etc.)
  * In addition to statements, certain acts which are testimonial in nature may also be protected
    * **Act of production doctrine** - can be invoked against requests to produce documents or other tangible evidence, the very act of which is incriminating on its own
      * Tends to communicate that the incriminating documents exist, are under person's control, are authentic, and are relevant to the subpoena
      * Availability of 5A privilege here depends on whether the existence of these documents is a "**foregone conclusion**" or not; if it is, 5A is N/A because production is not testimonial in nature, but rather surrendering of thing known to exist
    * However, the contents of pre-existing documents are not subject to 5A protection (because their creation was not “compelled”); only the act of producing them in response to something like a subpoena is
      * These can be lawfully searched for and seized
  * **Compulsory disclosure** - compulsion can be legal (e.g., threat of being held in contempt) or physical/psychological (e.g., intimidation by police)
    * Nor can person exercising this privilege face punishment for doing so; prosecutor in criminal case may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from D's invocation of 5A rights (not necessarily the case in civil proceedings)

* The 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination provides basis for refusal to testify in proceedings if answers provide **reasonable possibility of incriminating D in future criminal proceeding**
  * Applies to both civil and criminal proceedings, as well as other proceedings, formal or informal (e.g., Pharma Bro's congressional testimony)
  * Can be invoked by D in criminal proceeding against him as a basis for not taking the stand as a witness
    * Exception: if D is granted **immunity** from criminal prosecution for anything disclosed through his testimony or anything derived from it, can be compelled to testify
  * Other non-D witnesses can be compelled to take stand, but can invoke it as basis for refusing to respond to specific question(s)
    * Exception: if W has already testified against D (e.g., in earlier deposition), may not be able to invoke 5A at the trial due other constitutional issues (D's right of confrontation)
    * This privilege can be voluntarily waived
      * D waives it by taking the stand; however, once he does, he can't invoke it to when prosecution cross-examines his testimony
      * Witness waives it by disclosing self-incriminating information in response to a specific question
* In addition giving right of refusal to testify in legal proceedings, 5A privilege against self-incrimination also extends to questioning while in police custody (see following sub-section)

### Police Interrogations

* 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, combined with 6th Amendment right to counsel and rights to due process under the 5th (federal) and 14th (state) Amendments, provide number of procedural safeguards/protections for suspects in police custody

* First, any incriminating statement of evidence or confession obtained as result of **custodial interrogation** may not be used against suspect at subsequent trial unless police inform subject of *Miranda* rights
  * *Miranda* court takes expansive understanding of "compulsion" for purposes of 5A: **custodial interrogations = inherently coercive**
    * Since 5A protects against compulsory disclosure of self-incriminating statements, *Miranda* court concluded that statements obtained through such interrogations violate 5A absent some procedural safeguard (i.e., *Miranda* warning)
  * Custodial interrogation is what triggers need for for *Miranda* warning
    * Custodial - in custody means **formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom/restraint of movement to an extent associated with formal arrest**
      * Uses objective test: **given the totality of the circumstances, would reasonable person believe they could leave?**
        * For *Miranda* purposes, traffic stops and Terry stops do not amount to custody; nor is when police question at one's home or one voluntarily goes to police station for questioning
    * Interrogation - any action by police they **know or should know is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response**
      * "should know" - means it does not require intent to elicit such a response (although intent is still relevant, as is knowledge of suspect's vulnerability)
      * Does not include: questions need for booking, questions by undercover officers, administration of breathalyzer test, or where questions are motivated by **concern for public safety** or officer's safety
      * Volunteered statements, those offered purely on suspect's own volition and not in response to police inquiry, do not get *Miranda* protection
  * Miranda warning, by which law-enforcement provides suspects notice of their rights, must be issued before custodial interrogation begins
    * ***Miranda* rights** - Law-enforcement officials must inform suspects:
      * (1) Of their right to **remain silent**
      * (2) Any statement made while in custody can be used **against them in court**
      * (3) That they right to **presence of attorney**
      * (4) If they cannot afford one, an **attorney will be appointed**
    * Any statements before these rights are read and subsequently waived by the suspect can be **suppressed via the exclusionary exclusionary rule**
    * 5A right to presence of attorney is not the same as 6A, only triggered after one makes a **specific, unambiguous statement asserting his desire to have attorney present**
      * However, once invoked, **all questioning must stop until counsel is present**
    * Likewise, **invoking right to remain silent must be done affirmatively by clear, explicit statement** saying as much
      * If one simply remains silent, police don't have to terminate questioning, but they do if this right is invoked explicitly
  * Waiver of **Miranda** rights must be **voluntary, knowing, and intelligent**

### The Sweep Of Criminal Law In America

* Overview:
  * America has the largest penal system in the world with staggeringly high percentages of people
  incarcerated.
  * Over 2.3 million people are incarcerated in the US and the US has about 25% of the world’s incarcerated people despite having only about 5% of the worlds population. There are about another 2 million people on parole These numbers are exceptionally high, especially for a democracy.
  * There is both over enforcement and under enforcement. Some argue that minority communities are affected worse by under enforcement as communities are not protected from repeated violations of their rights. Criminals know that there are some crimes which they will not be arrested for and victims have their rights systematically violated by offenders who know the police will not come after them (Specifically domestic violence in minority communities is not prosecuted often)

* Social and Racial Concentration:
  * Black people make up about half of the population of incarcerated people despite being 13% of the population.
  * More than 20% of black men born since 1960 have been incarcerated for at least a year on a felony conviction.
  * Minorities receive harsher prison sentences than whites for the same crime.
  * David Garland writes that the US has mass imprisonment, which means that the US penal system has a heavy concentration on specific groups (i.e. minorities)

* Causes:
  * Despite crime rates dropping during the 1990’s incarceration rates are still high. One of theories is that legislators want incarceration to increase because they see it as the proper solution to a crime (i.e. Mandatory minimum sentencing for certain crimes guarantees jail time for some offenses)
  * US gives to primary to convictions over rehab for drug and alcohol offenses

### The Structure Of Criminal Justice The Relevant Institutional Actors

* Heavy volumes of cases and limited resources (personnel) create a system of mass production in the US penal system. The justice system is supposed to provide individualized responses to crime, but these two factors create a system where sentences are churned out factory style, often unfair to the perpetrator.
* Police officers often have discretion which crimes they will arrest people for and which groups of people they will target. Similarly, the DA’s office chooses who to prosecute and for what sentence. This creates a high degree of subjectiveness in a process that not should have any.
* The election of judges, DA’s, and other positions imbue the US penal system with the issue that these people will take voter reactions into consideration when making decisions leaving the system susceptible to short term emotionalism and issues of politics.

* Multiple Jurisdictions:
  * Criminal justice authority is dispersed throughout different levels. There are state forces (state troopers), many cities have independent police agencies with specialized missions (transit police, housing police), and most cities and states have independent prosecuting attorneys with specialized mandates ( a city department for municipal code enforcement, a state attorney general’s office). Alongside all of this there’s is the independent engine of federal law enforcement.. In this system there are multiple levels as well with multiple agencies, such as the DEA and SEC.
  * The criminal justice system is extremely decentralized. Some people describe the overlapping authorities of the police as chaotic and irrational.

* Police:
  * Decide who gets arrested. Crimes are, to an extent, defined by the police officer. He has discretion to either arrest or warn people violation laws.

* Prosecutors:
  * The decision to send a case to trial based on sufficient evidence is made by the prosecutor.
  * Needs all of his decisions to take a case to trial approved by a judge or grand jury, which they almost always are due to the low level of proof required
  * Has enormous power. Can either take a case to trial or drop a case, can ask for harsh or less harsh punishments.

* Defense Counsel: Only about 20% of defendants can afford their own attorneys
  * Non-indigent defendants: When people can afford to pay their own attorneys, often in massive lump some payments of thousands of dollars at a time. Attorney is paid regardless of whether the defendant accepts a guilty plea right away or goes to a lengthy trial.
  * Indigent defendants: Court picks the attorney for the defendant who then accepts or proceeds without counsel. This appointed counsel system means the court appoints the counsel from a private firm who usually gets paid but not beyond a pre-determined maximum. In contract system a lawyer or group of lawyers accepts payment from the government in exchange for representing clients. In defender systems the city has set up an office to deal with cases with counsel on payroll who then are not under constraints of the other systems to get cases over with quickly.

* Judges:
  * Most judges are elected by popular elections, some are appointed

* Corrections:
  * Goal of the system is no longer to correct, more to restrain and restrict

## Presentation of Evidence

* **The Order of Proof**:
  * First, the prosecution calls witnesses in an effort to prove the elements of the offense charged. Case may fail if they fail to meet the burden of proof.
  * If the prosecution does not fail, then the defense calls witnesses to refute the prosecutions case in chief to establish some **affirmative defense**. Defense can recall or call new witnesses for purpose of rebuttal. Defense is afforded a chance to answer by **rejoinder** any matters introduced in the prosecutors rebuttal.
  * Witnesses are first examined by the party that called them (direct examination) and afterward by the opposing party (cross examination). Further questioning is re-direct and re-cross.

* **Relevance**: Evidence is relevant for the purposes of the rules of evidence **only if it is both probative and material**. Evidence is probative only if it tends to establish the proposition for which it is offered or – to be precise – the proposition is more likely to be true given the evidence than it would be without the evidence. Probative is generally enough to be admissible, but if the evidence is not material is could be excluded.
  * Irrelevant evidence is never admissible
  * Relevant evidence is generally admissible

* **Exclusionary Rule: Privilege**
  * Sometimes relevant evidence cannot be admissible. Rules relating to privilege allow people to withhold certain types of testimony in order to protect certain interests.
  * One of the most important privileges is the privilege against self-incrimination (5th Amendment)

* **Exclusionary Rule: Prejudice**
  * Evidence must be excluded when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. **Evidence is prejudicial when it will affect the result in an improper way**. Thus, prejudice is involved if the jury is likely to overestimate the probative value of the evidence or if the evidence will arouse undue hostility toward one of the parties
    * Prejudice is read narrowly because theoretically everything is prejudicial.
    * The defendant should not have to prove his character when he is on trial, he only has to try try and prove his character and defend past transgressions as well as it would use of valuable court resources (See *Zackowitz*)
  
### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 401

> Evidence is relevant if (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence AND (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 402

> Relevant evidence is admissible unless [otherwise provided]. Irrelevant evidence is not permissible.

### *People v. Zackowitz* (1930 NY)

* Background: Case where prosecutor brought up prejudicial evidence of defendant character
* Facts: Zackowitz and his wife were walking down a street when four men, one of which was the victim Frank Coppola, made insulting remarks to Zackowitz’s wife that caused her to cry. Upon finding out what the four men said Zackowitz returned to where his wife was berated and a fight broke out. Zackowitz shot and Coppola. Zackowitz admitted to the crime, the issue here is the degree of murder he will be charged with. This hinged on whether the murder was premeditated or done in the heat of the moment. Prosecution brought up facts about Zackowitz’s character, calling him of murderous disposition in an attempt to get him convicted of the highest degree of murder by making premeditated seem more likely.
* Rule: **Cannot bring up aspects of a defendants character unless the defendant brings them up first. It’s impermissible to bring up prior convictions. One should be on trial for the crime they committed, not previous offenses.**
Holding: Zackowitz never brought up his character so when the prosecution did they imbued the jury with prejudice and therefore could not appropriately make determinations about Zackowitz’s state of mind without being prejudice.

* Related Hypotheticals From Class
  * Poor person from PA, prosecutor states that the person is more likely to steal because he is poor.
    * Is this argument allowed? **No**, it’s prejudicial despite being relevant.
  * Person is a gambling addict who owes a lot of money. Money is embezzled. Prosecutor tries to
  use gambling tendencies show he was the thief.
    * Is it allowed? *No*, its prejudicial despite being relevant.

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 403

> The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or no needlessly presenting cumulative defense.

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 404

> Crimes, Wrongs, or Other Acts… Evidence of a crime wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a persons character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character … This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

* Exceptions to the Rule of Prejudice:
* The rule against admitting other-crimes evidence is subject to a number of exceptions. (i.e. Evidence that the defendant stole the pistol used in the murder could be admissible to identify the defendant as the killer). Also can be used to show motive (i.e. if the victim was a witness to a previous crime committed by the defendant, this could show motive for murder)
* If the defendant chooses to testify in his own defense, then the prosecution can bring up prior crimes that he committed
* Sex Offense Cases: Evidence of prior crimes is allowed with sex offenses - Fed. Rule of Evidence 413(a)
* The same goes for child molestation cases, previous criminal acts are admissible as evidence – Fed. Rule of Evidence 414(a)
* However, these two exceptions must still pass 403, which means they must be more probative than prejudicial.

## Burden Of Proof

### MPC Section 1.12 – Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt; Affirmative Defenses; Burden of Proving Fact When Not an Element of an Offense; Presumptions

* (1) No person may be convicted of an offense unless each element of such offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of such proof, the innocence of the defendant is assumed
* (2) Subsection (1) of this Section does not:
  * Require the disproof of an affirmative defense unless and until there is evidence supporting such defense; or
  * Apply to any defense which the Code or another statute plainly requires the defendant to prove by a preponderance of evidence
* (3) A ground of defense is affirmative, within the meaning of Subsection (2)(a) of this
Section, when
  * It arises under a section of the Code which so provides; or
  * It relates to an offense defined by a statute other than the Code and statute so provides; or
  * It involves a matter of excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence
* (4) When the application of the Code depends upon the finding of a fact which is not an element of an offense, unless the Code otherwise provides
  * The burden of proving the fact is on the prosecution or defendant, depending on whose interest or contention will be furthered if the finding should be made; and
  * The fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court or jury, as the case may be
* (5) When the Code establishes a presumption with respect to any fact which is an element of an offense, it has the following consequences
  * When there is evidence of the facts which give rise to the presumption, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury, unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negatives the presumed fact; and
  * When the issue of the existence of the presumed fact is submitted to the jury, the court shall charge that while the presumed fact must, on all the evidence, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the law declares that the jury may regard the facts giving rise to the presumption as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact
* (6) Presumption not established by the Code or inconsistent with it has the consequences otherwise accorded it by law.

### *In Re Winship* (1970 SCOTUS)

* Facts: Defendant, a minor, was charged with committing acts, that if performed by an adult would constitute larceny. Defendant was found by a preponderance of the evidence to be guilty
* Holding: **Must use beyond a reasonable doubt standard when pursing a criminal case**. Social disutility, it is incredibly important to not convict an innocent man, it is more important than letting a guilty man walk free
* Notes:
  * McCullough v. State: Judge gave instruction on a scale of 1-10m to determine guilt. Supreme Court overruled stating that **beyond a reasonable doubt is supposed to be qualitative**. Making it quantitative could lower or increase the burden of proof

### *United States v. Dougherty* (1972 DC Circuit)

* Facts: Appellants broke into Dow Chemical plant. Appellants claim the lower level judge did not instruct the jury on jury nullification and claim the jury should have known that they can throw out the case regardless of the law
* Holding: Court has **no obligation to instruct jury on jury nullification**. Doing so would be too burdensome on the courts and runs the **risk of jurors taking the law into their own hands**.
* Concurrence/Dissent (Bazelon): If we want the jurors to know of the power of jury nullification it should be instructed to them. Jury nullification is a necessary counter to case-hardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors
* Notes
  * Many examples of pros and cons to jury nullification in the notes following Dougherty
  * Judges can get rid of jurors if it can be unambiguously proven that they intended to give a certain verdict regardless of the evidence and trial (US v. Thomas, juror should not have been thrown out because his intentions were unclear)
  * FIJA (organization that spreads awareness of jury nullification) often gets charged with jury tampering and other charges for trying to spread the idea of jury nullification. This contradicts the idea in Daugherty, that courts should instruct juries on jury nullification rather they should get info about jury nullification from other sources.

## Punishment

### MPC §1.02. Purposes; Principles of Construction (Attempting to Codify Why We Punish)

* (1) The general purposes of the provision governing the definition of offenses are:
  * To forbid and prevent conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests;
  * To subject to public control persons whose conduct indicates that they are disposed to commit crimes;
  * To safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal;
  * To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense
  * To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses
* (2) The general purposes of the provisions governing the sentencing and treatment of offenders are:
  * To prevent the commission of offenses;
    * To promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders;
  * To safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment;
  * To give fair warning of the nature of the sentences that may be imposed on conviction of an offense
  * To differentiate among offenders with a view to a just individualization in their treatment;
  * To define, coordinate and harmonize the powers, duties and functions of the courts and of administrative officers and agencies responsible for dealing with offenders
  * To advance the use of generally accepted scientific methods and knowledge in the sentencing and treatment of offenders
  * To integrate responsibility for the administrative of the correctional system in a State Department of Correction
* (3) The provisions of the Code shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purpose stated in this Section and the special purposes of the particular provision involved. The discretionary powers conferred by the Code shall be exercised in accordance with the criteria stated in the Code and, insofar as such criteria are not decisive, to further the general purposes stated in this Section.

### Richard A. Wright, Prisons: Prisoners, Encyclopedia Of Crime and Justice

* Punishment can be a fine, probation, imprisonment, death penalty, etc.
* The conviction itself is a form of punishment, it is an impediment to attaining jobs afterwards, can make future sentences worse, etc.
* Some jurisdictions have intermediate sanctions that are worse than probation, but not as bad as imprisonment (i.e. home detention, mandatory community service)
* Maximum security prisons are the most extreme type of prison. Although, all prisons breed a feeling of hopelessness within their inmates. Many gangs form in prison and those gangs are let loose on the streets when those prisoners are paroled. Many just hope to survive prison
* The general idea is that violence within prisons is underreported
* Prisons are incredibly overcrowded with many operating above their maximum capacity
* Suicide rates are higher in prison
* Incarceration without imprisonment: These are not technically prisons so they are not held to the
same safeguards that prisons are

### Civil Sanctions

* These types of sanctions do not have the same constitutional protections as imprisonment
* Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill is generally seen as a civil matter. They have a right
to treatment and when they are treated they must be released . However, if they are never fully
cured they could be confined for life.
* Registering of sex offenders is another type of civil sanction. Some states impose no limits on
the public disclosure of information of ex-offenders.
THEORIES OF PUNISHMENT (89-108, 113-116, 118-119, 122-124, 128-132)

### Theories of Punishment

* In General:
  * Punishment is intended to be unpleasant (unlike paying taxes, military service during wartime)
  * Why we punish generally falls into two categories, utilitarian and retributive

* **Utilitarian** – Consequentialist school of ethics prescribing actions that maximize social utility - essentially a cost-benefit analysis from the punishment (i.e. deterrence). Punishment should serve some additional purpose
  * Some of these additional purposes are deterrence, incapacitation of dangerous people, rehabilitation
  * Specific Deterrence: Deterring the specific person who committed the crime
  * General Deterrence: Deterring the general population from committing the crime
  * > “The general object which all laws have, or ought to have, in common, is to augment the total happiness of the community; and therefore, in the first place, to exclude, as far as may be, every thing that tends to subtract from the happiness: in other words to exclude mischief. But all punishment is mischief: all punishment in itself is evil. Upon the principle of utility, if it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only be admitted in as far as it promise to exclude some greater evil - Jeremy Bentham"
  * Issues with Utilitarian View: Can require extremely severe punishments that would be disproportionate to a defendants blameworthiness, merely because those punishments produce other beneficial consequence for society. Conversely, it can produce too lenient of a sentence for a harsh crime if the perpetrator is not likely to commit the crime again.

* Retribution - “A retributivist punishes because, and only because, the offender deserves it" Many types of retributive punishments, but all focus on the idea that the punishment must be justified by the seriousness of the offense committed
  * **Positive Retributivism**: Society must punish the blameworthy with equivalent severity to the seriousness of the crime
  * **Negative Retributivism**: The seriousness of the crime sets the upper limit of the punishment, but it is not mandated that the perpetrator get that maximum punishment
  * Issues with Retribution: Can call for punishments that do much more harm than good (i.e. requiring a perpetrator to go to jail which forces his children into foster care). It can also give out a just penalty to an offender, but that punishment might not deter him from performing the crime again.

* Cousins Of Retribution
  * **Retaliation and Vengeance**: Punishment stamps the perpetrator with a mark of indignation for life. Follows the idea that one can hate the perpetrator

* Mixed Theories – Punishments purpose is utilitarian: to reduce crime and thus protect the rights of all to be secure in their persons and property. But that purpose must be pursued within retribution [just deserts] limits. Thus a person can legitimately be punished only if he committed a crime, only in proportion to that crime, and only if doing so would produce a world with less crime" This approach bars disproportionate punishment, even if a cost-benefit calculus supports it, but it also bars punishment that is perfectly proportionate to an offender’s blame if that punishment would not be socially beneficial under all circumstances

## Sentencing

* Overview:
  * In response to aggravation with judge discretion in regards to sentencing, there have been several reforms including mandatory minimums and three strikes in and your out
  * This essentially takes the power of discretion away from the judge and gives it to the prosecutor
* Mandatory Minimums:
* Sentences that judges have to give out if a crime is committed (Ex. The Fighter case). Very common in drug related crimes.
* The original goal was eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, however racial disparities have increased with the proliferation of mandatory minimums

### *United States v. Vazquez* (2010 NY)

Vazquez was a part but not a huge part of his brother’s drug dealing empire. When Vazquez was caught he cooperated with law enforcement and gave them names. Most people agree that what Vazquez was doing was not worthy of the 5 year mandatory minimum, but the US attorney’s office wouldn’t budge on the number and Vazquez is convicted and sentenced the mandatory minimum, which adversely affects him, his 3 year old daughter, and the rest of his family. The mandatory minimum treats all people the same from low-level people in drug empires to the drug lords themselves, if they are found with a certain amount of drugs on them theny they are going to get the mandatory minimum most likely, even though it is unjust on occasions for people who are not as involved as they higher up people in the drug empire

### Three Strikes

* If a person commits several offenses and is convicted of those crimes, then in some jurisdictions the three strike policy gives the perpetrator 25 to life
* Punishes repeat offenders and gets them off the street.
* Clearly prior imprisonment has neither deterred nor rehabilitated these types of offenders, so the three strike policy puts them away likely for good
* Is it grossly disproportionate? If it is the third offense, a person can get 25 to life for stealing a candy bar. It that just?

### *Ewing v. California* (2003)

* Facts: Ewing was convicted of several serious felonies in his past. Ranging from burglary to possession of drug paraphernalia, Ewing previously spent time in prison and on parole for several serious offenses. Ewing then was convicted of larceny again when he stole golf clubs. Due to California’s three strike rule, Ewing was sentenced to 25 to life.
* Question: Does the three strike rule violate the constitutions 8th amendment?
* Holding: No. Since traditional forms of deterrence have not worked for a career criminal like Ewing, 25 to life is not cruel and unusual, even though he only stole golf clubs. The 8th amendment protects against grossly unfair punishments. For repeat offenders of serious crimes like Ewing, 25 to life is not cruel and unusual. The 8th amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.
* Dissent (Breyer and others): 25 to life is grossly disproportional for stealing golf clubs

### *Graham V Florida* (2010)

* Facts: Graham, a minor, was arrested for breaking into a home while on probation for another robbery. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
* Question: Is life in prison to a minor for a non-homicidal offense constitutional?
* Holding: No, **it violates the 8th Amendment by being a grossly disproportionate sentence**. Imprisonment for life without parole is similar to the death sentence. Especially since this is a non-homicidal case, LWOP for a minor is grossly disproportionate.
* Concurrence (Roberts): Judges must use discretion when handling cases and consider the fact the defendant is a juvenile who are less culpable than adults.
* Dissent (Thomas): Decision that LWOP in this case is unconstitutional is should not be up to the decision of the courts.

# Elements of a Crime

* Concept of Culpability - This is endorsed fully by the MPC and by the common law (generally) that in order to be held criminally liable, you need the guilty mind (mens rea) and an action on the guilty mind (actus reus). That is, we don’t punish people for evil thoughts

## Actus Reus

* There is a difference between voluntary and blameworthy acts - Actus Reus is only one component for criminal liability; it is **necessary but not sufficient**
* Components of Actus Reus - It generally includes three ingredients of a crime:
  1) A voluntary act;
  2) that causes;
  3) a social harm
     * Both “voluntary acts” and “social harms” are the terms of art that require special attention
* MPC 2.01
  * (1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable
  * (2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section:
    * (a) a reflex or convulsion;
    * (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
    * (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
    * (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual
  * (3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:
    * (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or
    * (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law
  * (4) Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession

* Voluntariness Requirement:
  * Narrow Meaning: A movement of the body which follows our volition
    * Put in another way – a voluntary act is one that involves use off the human mind (thinking notion of free will) and an involuntary act involves the use of the human brain (mechanical functioning of the brain)
    * However, something is not voluntary just because the person is unaware what they are doing…the law treats habitual acts as falling on the voluntary side of the continuum, even if the ultimate action related is involuntary (i.e. habit of smoking and you light up without thinking so often you burn down a house)
  * Broad Meaning: The defendant possessed sufficient free choice to be blamed for his conduct
  * MPC definition of Voluntary: “bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary.” But what level of involuntary movement is considered appropriate?
  * Do All Elements Have to be Voluntary? Under the MPC, it seems that only one element of the crime must be voluntary. So going back to Martin perhaps all they needed was the voluntary act of drunkenness to convict
    * Would we get better deterrence in Martin’s case if we only require the voluntary act of drunkenness and just found people culpable if they voluntarily or involuntarily ended up in the street
      * But does this unfairly restrict the lawful liberty to drink?
  * Rationale: Why should a person whose involuntary act causes harm to anther escape punishment? One frequent explanation is that the law cannot deter involuntary movement. It would make no sense for the utilitarian to support punishment for involuntary acts. But it would make sense if the utilitarian could prove the punishing involuntary behavior would incentive people to adjudge behavior in the first place. The criminal justice system is another mechanism for social control
    * The voluntary act requirement is far more closely linked to retributivism's respect for human autonomy
    * The theory is one that is premised on the view that ‘the critical distinction between criminal law and other systems of confinement is that the criminal sanction carries with it something more – stigmatization of moral blameworthiness

* Omissions
  * General Principle – Very Few Affirmative Duties. Not every moral obligation to act creates a concomitant legal duty. Subject to a few limited exceptions, a person has no criminal law duty to act to prevent harm to another; even if she can do so at no risk to herself, and even if the person imperiled may lose her life in the absence of assistance
    * The utilitarian view would obviously find the law severely deficient in this respect
  * Common Law - Liability for a criminal offense may be predicated on an omission, rather than on a voluntary act. Such cases involve what may by termed “commission by omission” liability
    * **When a common law duty to act exists, and assuming that she was physically capable of performing that act, a defendant’s omission of the duty to act serves as a legal substitute for a voluntary act**
    * When is there a Duty to Act?
      * **Status Relationships** - A person will have a common law duty to act IF they have a special status in relation to the other. Examples include parents to their minor children, married couples to one another, employers to employees, inviters to invitees
      * **Contractual Obligation** - A duty to act may be created by implied or express contract. For example, one who breaches an agreement to house, feed, and provide medical care to an infirm stranger...
      * **Creation of a Risk** - A person who wrongfully harms another or another’s property, or who wrongfully places a person or her property in jeopardy of harm, has a common law duty to aid the injured or endangered party.
        * Culpable Injuries Caused – If D negligently injuries V, D has a common law duty to render aid to V. If D fails to do so, and V dies as a the result of the omission, D may be held criminally liable for V’s death.
        * Non Culpable Injuries Caused – Although there is considerably less case law in this respect, a duty to act arguably arises from non-culpable risk-creation as well. For example, a few courts have held that one who accidentally starts a house fire can be held liable for arson if she fails to extinguish the fire or seek proper help. There is also some authority for the proposition that even one justifiably shoots an aggressor in self-defense, seriously wounding them, may have a subsequent duty to obtain medical aid for the wounded once they no longer pose a threat
      * **Voluntary Assistance** -  Once you start to commence aiding someone then you have the duty to continue to provide aid. Moreover, you’re under the duty to render as helpful aid you can
      * **Statutory Duties** & Bad Samaritan Laws - Statutes can create affirmative duties. For example, having a drivers license creates a duty to stop a care at the scene of a car accident you’re in
        * Bad Samaritan laws are those that make it a misdemeanor for a person not to render aid to a stranger in peril. Very few states adopt this standard, but they exist. Critics assert that either nobody can be fairly prosecuted under them when multiple people are available for rescue, or it just gives the prosecutor too much arbitrary power
  * MPC Approach - The MPC does not differ significantly from the common law regarding omissions. Liability based on omission is permitted in two circumstances: 1) if the law defining the offense provides for it; or 2) if the duty to act is “otherwise imposed by law.” The latter category incorporates duties arising under civil law (i.e. torts and contract)

* Public Policy Rationale
  * Purpose of Actus Reus:
    * Criminal law shouldn’t punish thoughts alone (although some crimes such as conspiracy involve planning)
    * Criminal law can’t deter involuntary actions (Newton) or involuntary conditions (Jones v. LA)
    * Involuntary actors should get treatment, not criminal stigma(Robinson)
      * Blurry line between “voluntary” and “involuntary” (compare Martin to Low, see Powell and Moore)
  * Purpose of no Affirmative Duty to Act:
    * Individual autonomy (law doesn’t want to compel people to act a certain way)
    * Immoral actions are not always equate to criminal
    * Risks possible harm to self or others in some cases
    * May lead to over-deterrence (ie. people act too often even in cases not requiring assistance)
    * Bystander Effect - People people generally don’t act b/c don’t want to risk failure, people fear risking injury, and free-rider problem (figure someone else will act) (ex: New Bedford and Kitty Genovese cases)
  * Rotten Social Background (RSB) theory
    * Should coming from an underprivileged, poverty background affect actus reus determinations b/c the alleged criminal might not have known any better. On the one hand, seems fairer, but may be too ambiguous, exploitable, paternalistic, categorical, and broader social issue outside criminal law

### Martin v State (1944 AL)

* Facts: D was convicted of being drunk on a public highway. Officers arrested him at home and brought him to the highway where his drunken shouts and profane language caused him to be in violation of a statute preventing drunk people from appearing drunk in a public place
* Rule: **Criminal liability may only be imposed when the unlawful conduct is committed voluntarily**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed
  * Criminal liability always requires element actus reus, that is, the commission of some voluntary act that is prohibited by law
  * Culpability cannot be established (because) proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated condition was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the arresting officer
* Lecture Analysis: The statute requires someone to be drunk AND on a public highway. Martin unquestionably voluntarily got drunk, but involuntary was brought on a highway. If we hold to the MPC, then perhaps we only need one act
  * But this case is interesting because it brings up for debate whether you need voluntary act to convict or all of them
* Notes: When is an Act Voluntary or Involuntary?
  * *People v Lowe*: Man was arrested and brought to jail. He also had drugs in his socks. When the police found out, he was charged with violating a statue concerned with “knowingly brining a controlled substances into jail.” CA Supreme Court upheld the conviction distinguishing from Martin by holding that the man had a **voluntary opportunity to relinquish** the drugs prior to entering the premises
  * *State v Eaton*: Same facts as Lowe, but here the court said that the so-called “voluntary act” of relinquishing the drugs isn’t really a true choice. “The defendant had **no available choice** other than to surrender evidence that would convict him of another crime, and therefore failing to read a voluntariness requirement into the statute would produce absurd results”
  * *Jones v City of LA*: Homeless men convicted of violating ordinances by sleeping on sidewalks. Arguing that there were not enough homeless shelters, the homeless had **no choice** but to sleep on the sidewalks, the court agreed that the criminal act was not voluntary

### People v Newton – The Scope of Involuntary Movement Sufficient for Actus Reus

* Facts: D was pulled over by police officers. There was an altercation and one of the officers was shot after D was shot. D argues that his gun-shot wound produced and unconscious/reflexive shot reaction that caused him to shoot the police officer. Expert witness testified that D's recollections were “compatible” with the gunshot he had received and that it was common for a person to go into a reflex shock condition causing loss of consciousness for short periods of time following a gunshot wound that penetrates the abdominal cavity. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the subject of unconsciousness as a defense to D's offense and D is convicted
* Issue: Was it improper not to instruct jury that non self-inflicted unconsciousness  is a complete defense?
* Rule: **Involuntary movement not self-inflicted or self-knowledgeable (e.g. Non self-induced unconsciousness) cannot be the basis for actus reus**
* Holding: Conviction reversed
  * Although the evidence surrounding the events is confusing and conflicting, some of it supports the inference that D had been shot in the abdomen before he fired any shots himself
    * Where evidence of involuntary unconsciousness has been produced in a homicide prosecution, the refusal by the trial court to provide a requested instruction on the subject is prejudicial error
  * Unconsciousness does not just mean a coma or inability of locomotion. Rather, it can exist where the subject physically acts in fact, but is not, at the time conscious of acting. When evidence of involuntary unconsciousness has been produced in a homicide prosecution, the refusal of a requested instruction of the subject is a prejudicial error.

### Voluntariness Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical 1: Going back to Newton, instead of the defense being a physiological reflex to his gunshot wound, suppose because Newton’s been harassed for years by the police, he has a psychological aversion to the police akin to PTSD. If he’s touched by police, he acts almost unconsciously, without almost disregard – not a product of free will. Is this a complete defense like in the actual case?
  * **Maybe not** – the social condition might be really really hard to resist, but a tough temptation is different from complete lack of free will. Hard to say there’s no free will here
  
* Hypothetical 2: Man driving voluntarily has an epileptic seizure and gets into a fatal car accident – didn’t intend to kill anyone, but he had a history of epilepsy and didn’t take his pills. State charges with manslaughter. Convict?
  * **Maybe** – driving with knowledge and foreseeability that this involuntary reflex could occur without taking meds might be enough for gross recklessness.
  
* Hypothetical 3: Same facts of Hypo 2, but instead of epilepsy it’s heart disease and you know you’ve got a history of heart attacks and you haven’t been taking your pills. You have a massive heart attack and get in a fatal car accident. Manslaughter?
  * **Probably not** – Not as foreseeable, there’s a higher foreseeability of seizure. Heart attacks don’t happen as often

### *Robinson v California* (1962)

* Facts: D was convicted under a statue that made it a criminal offense to be addicted to narcotics. The man displayed tissue scaring and needlemarks consistent with narcotics use. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that it could convict *Robinson* if it either found that he used drugs in California or found he was addicted to drugs
* Issue: Is a Pattern of Behavior a Voluntary Act or is imprisoning someone on this basis unconstitutional?
* Rule: A criminal statute that creates a form of continuous criminal liability **that fails to require an act to be performed within the jurisdiction and instead imposes a crime for a status (e.g. disease) is unconstitutional**
* Holding: State law can't impose criminal liability for drug addition, it violates 8A protection against cruel and unusual punishment
  * The trial judge instructed the jury that even if it found *Robinson* had not used drugs, it could still find him in violation of the statute if it found *Robinson* was addicted to drugs. Thus he is punished not for some act, but because of his status
  * It is unlikely that any state at this moment in history would attempt to make it a criminal offense for a person to be mentally ill, or a leper, or to be afflicted with a venereal disease – yet this statue seems to imply such a change could occur
* Concurrence - Drug addiction merely shows his desire to use drugs, and the mere desire to commit a crime is not a criminal act
* Dissent - The conviction was not based solely on his status as a drug addict. The same evidence that proves he was an addict also proves that he regularly used drugs
* Lecture Analysis: Why does the Constitution not allow this type of statute? Much like the above Hypo #2, why can we say “if you know you have seizures regularly and you get into a car and then hurt someone, you’ll be punished.” But we CAN’T say “if you’ll do drugs and then get addicted, you’ll get punished?” In general, the court seems hesitant to hold that Due Process permits punishing people’s status.

### *Powell* v Texas (1968)

* Facts: D was arrested for public intoxication. However, but D offered the defense that his conduct was caused by disease of chronic alcoholism causing him to drink involuntarily. He was convicted anyways
* Rule: The punishment of conduct that is symptomatic of chronic alcoholism is not in violation of 8A
* Holding: Conviction is upheld
  * In *Robinson*, the state sought to punish a mere status and to regulate an individual’s behavior in their own home. Neither of those issues are present here
  * Here, D is **not punished for being a chronic alcoholic. He is punished for breaking the law** by going out in public while intoxicated
  * Additionally, medical research on chronic alcoholism is too vague and unsettled to as to what the disease entails. Would be too hard to formulate a rule that would relieve individuals of guilt and, furthermore, it would be up to the state courts formulate it
* Dissent: D’s alcoholism is disease that involuntarily made D appear in public
* Lecture Analysis: It’s not clear that alcoholism means you have no control over whether to START drinking, but rather it means once you start you can’t stop. But you can decide not to drink
  * This is probably noticeably different than hard drugs. Plus, this statue prevents public intoxication – D still made a choice to go out in public. Could have just gotten drunk in his house
  * Marshall – a liberal who surprisingly sides with the majority here – does so because if he strikes this statue down it might lead to civil commitment statutes that could be used as racial weapons

### *United States v Moore* (1973 DC)

* Facts: D was convicted of heroin possession. Drawing on *Robinson*, he contends the conviction was improper because he was a heroin addict with a need to use it – therefore it’s punishing his addiction to be convicted for carrying the means of his addiction
* Rule: **An individual who evidences an intense dependence on drugs resulting in loss of self-control may not use his behavior impairment as a defense to criminal culpability**
* Holding: D's conviction is upheld - not a valid defense to criminal liability
  * This case presents the court with an opportunity to rely with the *Robinson* precedent or the *Powell*. They chose *Powell* and argue that the underlying possession can be punished
  * “Appellant could never put the needle in his arm the first and many times without an exercise of will. Appellants illegal acquisition and possession was the direct product of a freely willed illegal act. The drug addition is a disease that Appellant has induced himself through a violation of the law. Every addict makes a choice…”
* Dissent: A drug addict should not be convicted for possession of narcotics that are solely for his on use - some addicts have overwhelming psychological and physiological need for these drugs that negate free will
* Notes: Reconciling *Robinson*, *Powell*, and *Moore*?
  * The cases beg the question: If we hold to *Robinson*, then surely possessing drugs is a function of addition. We can hold to *Powell* and say even addicts exercise free will (as the court in *Moore* seems to agree) but then again alcohol addiction seems substantively less addicting. How to reconcile?
    * Indeterminate Argument – It’s just for enforcement to determine who is a using and who is a true addict, so if we catch you with drugs we have to assume the former. Still can’t prosecute based on needle marks
    * Personal Use – Maybe another argument to reconcile is to say that *Moore* just means that if you can prove the drugs were for personal use then *Robinson* controls. But the court makers pretty clear that it’s not the objective
  * **The court relies on *Powell*. Today, *Robinson* has less control and *Powell* is the important case that emphasizes the states’ continued ability to determine punishments**

### *Jones v U.S.* (1962 DC)

* Facts: Ten month-old baby belonging to D’s friends dies of malnourishment after D failed to provide food and necessities. Mother claimed she had contract with D to care for children, but D denied this. D charged with involuntary manslaughter for failure to perform care for child, but D argued jury instruction required jury to find D had a legal duty.
* Rule: **Imposing criminal liability on a D for omission requires proving D had a legal duty to act**
* Holding: Manslaughter conviction reversed
  * A defendant may be convicted for an omission to act if: (1) the defendant was under a statutory obligation to care for the victim, (2) the defendant was in a sufficiently close relationship with the victim, (3) the defendant contractually agreed to provide care for the victim, or (4) the defendant voluntarily took on the care of the victim, such that the victim was secluded from others who might have helped him
  * Trial judge failed to instruct the jury that Jones could only be convicted if there was proof that she was under a legal duty to feed and provide medical care
  * There was no special status duty for the D. The mother had an affirmative duty to provide for the child, but here there is no obvious duty that makes D’s omission improper, must be remanded to be determined by trier of fact

### *Pope v State* (1970 MD)

* Facts: Pope was convicted of felony child abuse. Norris, a friend of hers, lived with Pope and was young mother of three-month old babe. Norris was also mentally ill and killed her baby in a psychotic episode. Pope was present during the attack – was she under obligation to prevent the attack?
* Rule: **Criminal liability may not be imposed upon an individual for failing to fulfill a moral, instead of a legal, obligation**
* Holding: No, Pope had no legal obligation to intervene
  * Pope’s conduct, during and after the acts of abuse, must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child, she was under no legal obligation to do so unless she had responsibility for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute. She may not be punished by our system for failing to fulfil a moral obligation

## Mens Rea

* Conceptions
  * Broad Meaning - The "evil mind" or "The vicious will" - essentially refers to the blameworthiness entailed in choosing to commit a criminal wrong. This requirement reflects the common sense view of justice that blame and punishment are inappropriate in the absence of choice. According to this definition, guilt for an offense is not dependent on proof that the actor caused the proscribed harm with any specific mental state, it is not necessary to show that he committed the offense “knowingly” or with any particular frame of mind
    * For example, in *Reginia v Cunningham* D entered the cellar building, where he tore the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole the coins deposited in the meter. As a consequence, gas escaped from the pipes and nearly asphyxiated V.
      * Although he did not intend to endanger anyone’s life, he was charged because the offense was “whosoever shall maliciously cause to be administered to or taken by annoy other person any poison...shall be guilty"
  * Narrow Meaning – Mens rea may also be defined, as a more formal or technical requirement: the particular mental awareness or intention provided for in the definition of an offense that must accompany the act. This is the “elemental” meaning of mens rea. A person may possess mens rea in the culpability sense of the term, and yet lack the requisite elemental mens rea. Analysis here is limited to determining whether a defendant intended, expected, or should have expected his actions would produce the consequences

* Common Law Distinction Between Specific Intent and General Intent
  * General Intent = any offense from which the only mens rea required was a blameworthy state of mind.
  * Specific Intent = was meant to empathize that the definition of the offense expressly required proof of a particular mens rea
    * The problem is that today most penal statutes expressly include a mens rea term, or a particular state of mind is judicially implied, so the line between “general” and “specific intent” is much more difficult to draw.
    * A good distinction: A specific intent is one in which the definition of the crime:
      * Requires proof of an intention by the actor to perform some future act or achieve some further consequence, beyond the conduct or result that constitutes the social harm of the offense; 2) requires proof of some special motive for the conduct; 3) provides that the actor must be aware of a statutory attendant circumstance
      * An offense that does not contain one of these features is termed “general intent”
    * Example: Common law burglary is defined as “breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony therein.” The actus reus of this offense is complete when the offender breaks and enters another person’s dwelling at night. However, to be guilty of burglary, the actor must intend a further act – commission of a felony inside the dwelling house
      * But that future act is not part of the social harm of the offense; it does not have to occur. Thus, common law burglary is characterized as a specific intent offense.

### MPC Definitions

* **Culpability** - Unless otherwise provided by statute or existing law a person is not guilty of an offense unless they acted purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently as the law may require **with respect to each material element of the offense**
* **Purposefully** - A person acts purposefully with respect to a material element of a crime if it the conscious object to engage in such conduct and cause such result OR he is aware of attendant circumstances or believes/hopes the exist
* **Knowingly** -  A person acts knowingly with respect to an element if practically certain that conduct will cause such result and aware of the nature of the conduct or attendant circumstances
* **Recklessly** -  A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such that, based on circumstances known to the actor, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the reasonable person standard of conduct
* **Negligently** - A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation

* Applying the MPC
  * MPC analysis involves 2 steps:
    1. Determine the "material elements" of an offense - MPC §1.13 provides criteria for determining this
    1. Must determine which type of mens rea is required with respect to each material element
       * Assumption that, if legislature has specified a particular type a culpability as sufficient for an individual material element of the crime, it was meant to apply to all material elements unless a contrary purpose appears

### *Regina v Cunningham* (1957 UK)

* Facts: D removed a gas meter to steal money inside which lead to noxious fumes being funneled into his neighbors house which could have killed her. The issue was the D was charged under a statute prohibiting “malicious” conduct of this kind which the district court interpreted to mean “general wickedness”
* Rule: **The term malice in a criminal statute does not mean general wickedness; it means either (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that was in fact done or (2) reckless disregard of a foreseeable risk that the harm would result**
* Holding: The Court reversed the conviction because "maliciously" was improperly defined by the trial judge. It interpreted "maliciously" to mean foresight to do specific harm rather than general wickedness. Thus, D must have acted maliciously in the gas meter so as to endanger here life
* Lecture Analysis: Doesn’t general wickedness imply foresight to harm and intent? The concept of the overturn here is that the appeals court was concerned about layering culpability – i.e. if you find the stealing of money “generally wicked” then of course you’ll find the release of noxious fumes wicked too. But D’s mental state was clearly not malicious on the level of intent
* Notes: Applying the Mens Rea of MPC to *Cunningham*. Assuming the facts of Cunningham but the mens rea of the MPC, what would each level of culpability look like?:
  * Purpose – I want this person to inhale gas
  * Knowing – There was a very high risk the gas would go through the wall and D hoped by some miracle it wouldn’t but he had
    * (1) Full knowledge of the consequences
    * (2) They were practically certain to occur
  * Reckless – I don’t know that she’ll inhale the gas, but D disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Risk taken with no justification for an action or awareness of it
    * This is where the appeals court in Cunningham seems to place D’s blameworthiness
  * Negligence – Completely unaware the gas will escape or go through the wall, but a reasonable person in D’s shoes would have known
  * Strict Liability – Doesn’t matter

### Negligence

* **Definition** - A person’s conduct is ‘negligent’ if it constitutes a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the actor’s situation. Conduct constitutes such a negligent deviation if the actor fails to appreciate that he is taking an unjustifiable risk of causing harm to another. **It is an objective fault**

* **Reasonableness** - The reasonableness of action can depend on 1) the gravity of the harm that foreseeably would result from the defendant’s conduct; 2) the probability of such harm occurring; and 3) the burden – or loss – to the defendant of desisting from the risky conduct (i.e. the ‘worth’ of taking the risk’)

* **Difference between Criminal and Civil Negligence** - Although rare circumstances exist, “civil negligence ordinarily is considered an inappropriate predicate by which to define criminal conduct.” To establish criminal responsibility for negligence, the prosecution must ordinarily show more than mere deviation from the standard of care that would constitute civil negligence
  * The key is usually a gross amount of negligence to qualify for criminal liability
  * **But gross negligence should not be equated to recklessness**

* Should Negligence Ever be Punished? Mens rea means guilty mind and yet the negligent actor is blamed and punished for what “isn’t in his mind, namely, attention to risk that a reasonable person would display.
  * Retort: Utilitarians argue that punishment for negligence primarily focuses on general deterrence. Retributivists offer competing arguments

* *Reginia v Faulkner*
  * Facts: D attempted to steal rum in the hold of a ship lights a match to see where the rum is and accidentally burns down the ship. D convicted of theft and arson (for arson, judge jury instruction that if D guilty of theft then also liable for arson), he argued that the jury instructions were improper. The question – should there be a difference morally between the person who accidentally does something and someone who doesn’t?
  * Holding: Jury were improperly directed to return guilty verdict upon finding that the firing of the ship, though accidental, was caused by an act done in the course of a felonious operation
    * The statute does not include a culpability standard of simple negligence. There’s probably enough here for simple negligence (though maybe not gross negligence), but the offense requires the act be willful and intentional
    * “If while a person is engaged in committing a felony...he accidentally does some collateral act, which if done willfully would be another felony...he is guilty of the later felony...but I am not prepared without more consideration to give my assent to so wide a proposition”

* *State v Hazelwood* (1997 AK)
  * Facts: Famous ExXon Valdez case – huge oil spill when ship negligently runs aground. Charged under a statute where conduct is a misdemeanor when committed negligently. On appeal, it is overturned on statutory interpretation reasoning that the legislators must have meant gross negligence (i.e. something more than just simple civil negligence)
  * Holding: Ruling the simple negligence would be sufficient to impose criminal liability in the statute, the conviction is overturned
    * **Simple negligence is sufficient to provide assurance that criminal penalties will be imposed only when the conduct at issue is something society can reasonably expected to deter**
  * Lecture Commentary
    * Case shows that courts are philosophically trying to work through whether or not, even when a status authorizes negligence for criminality – there should be something more than simple negligence (e.g. whether gross negligence is enough). Here, it determine that it simple negligence is sufficient

* *Santillanes v. New Mexico* (1993 NM)
  * Facts - D accidentally injured his nephew (minor) in an altercation.  D convicted of child abuse (judge jury instruction that D guilty of child abuse if D failed civil negligence standard), D argued for a heightened standard of criminal negligence
  * Holding - Ordinary civil negligence is not sufficient to impose criminal liability
    * When moral condemnation attaches to conviction of a crime, the **crime should typically reflect mental state warranting such contempt**
    * Court interprets intended scope to punish only conduct that is morally culpable, thus simple negligence standard is not enough

* *Elonis v United States* (2015)
  * Facts: D was charged under a federal statue making it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce “any communication containing any threat...to injury the person of another.” After D’s wife left him, he began posting certain songs and lyrics that would suggest he was threatening his ex-wife. Although he posted disclaimers that the lyrics were “fictions” he was charged under the statute. He requested a jury instruction requiring the jury to find intent to convict him. He was denied the request.
  * Holding: SCOTUS reversed the conviction. He was improperly convicted under a statute with no intent requirement which the court misinterpreted as allowing mens rea to be satisfied by simple negligence through “reasonable person” standard
    * Reasonable person standard is inconsistent with conventional requirement of criminal law - awareness of some wrongdoing
    * If no mental state is defined in the statue, it doesn't mean that none exists and should not be read as dispensing with criminal intent requirement. Criminal wrongdoing must be conscious, negligence cannot be the default. Instead, the general rule is that a guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime

### Recklessness

* **Definition** - Involves conscious risk creation. Most jurisdictions apply a standard that requires proof that the actor disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of which he was aware. According to the prevailing view the line between “criminal negligence” and “recklessness” is not drawn on the basis of the extent of the actor’s deviation from the standard of reasonable care – the deviation is gross or substantial in both cases – but rather is founded on the actor’s state of mind in regard to risk

* **Malice** - Sometimes malice can be used instead of “recklessness” in the common law context -- and often times can mean both intentionally and recklessly causes social harm

* **Contrasted with Negligence**
  * For recklessness, awareness of a risk that is a probability less that substantial certainty is what distinguishes it from negligence. "The risk of which the actor is aware must of course be substantial in order for the recklessness judgement to be made. This risk must also be unjustifiable."
    * Recklessness  = Actor was subjectively aware of the danger but acted anyway
    * Negligence = The actor was not subjectively aware, but should have been
  * Thus, for someone to be guilty of recklessness, the actor must be aware that 1) there is a risk; 2) that the risk is substantial; and 3) that the risk is unjustifiable
    * The MPC seems to require all three – and in practice, the justification for the risk is reserved for the jury to determine
  * Question: Must the actor SUBJECTIVELY believe that the risk is substantial or is this an OBJECTIVE standard?
  * Hypo: D’s trained as a superior marksman – and knows he’s pretty good. He fires a rifle at a backyard chair where children are playing for practice. A friend warns him it’s too dangerous, but he is confident in his award winning shooting skills. He shoots and injuries a child. Reckless?
    * Subjectively: Maybe this is negligence because he thought he was good enough
    * Objectively: A jury would probably say this is reckless

### Knowledge

* Contrasted with recklessness
  * Recklessness is to consciously disregard a substantial risk of the conduct causing harm (MPC §2.02(2))
  * Knowledge is awareness that the harm is practically certain

* Awareness of high probability as knowledge
  * Federal standard
    * (1) Where an individual subjectively believes the probability that a fact exists is high AND (2) the individual takes deliberate actions to avoid learning this fact, then this type of awareness is more culpable than recklessness (i.e. on the same level as knowledge)
    * However, there remains questions about whether this requires an affirmative act to avoid learning the truth (i.e. take steps to ensure one doesn't acquire knowledge). If this is the standard, it is unlikely that failure to investigate (e.g. *Jewell*) is any more culpable than recklessness
  
* *Jewell* (1976) 9th CC
  * Facts - D caught transporting drugs in his car from MX into US, and D claimed he didn’t know drugs were there.  Circumstantial evidence that D knew of the compartment but acted w/ willful blindness to confirming it.  D convicted of drug trafficking (judge jury instruction that D’s willful blindness sufficient), but D argued requires D must “absolutely, positively” know the drugs were in the compartment
  * Holding - **“Knowingly” includes “willful blindness”** (ie. D’s awareness of the high probability of an illegal act, but purposefully failing to investigate the illegal act’s existence to remain ignorant). Court provides both policy and substantive for rejecting the "willful blindness" defense: Substantive - Deliberate ignorance is equally culpable as positive knowledge; Policy - This would be used as a defense by drug traffickers in order to avoid punishment
  * Dissent (Kennedy): Proper jury instruction must clearly state requirements of culpability: that D is aware of facts indicating high probability, that D does not actually believe there was no controlled substance in the car (subjective standard). The instructions were thus defective; proper instruction based on MPC should use its definition of knowledge, not an alternative to it (i.e. a separate willful blindness standard)
    * Ostrich Instructions can be dangerous because they can sometime imply that true ignorance is not an excuse to criminal culpability – it is an excuse. If D genuinely did not believe the drugs were in the car, despite inferential opportunities, this negates “knowing.” The jury needs to be instructed as such
  * Notes: MPC states that “when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist”
    * The doctrine was clarified in Global-Tech Appliance v SEB. To be culpable under the willful blindness doctrine,
      * The defendant must 1) subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and 2) must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.
    * Issue with Affirmative Action: Does failing to take an affirmative action to inquire to ‘learn the truth’ sufficient under a willful blindness doctrine. The SCOTUS has not made a determination as to whether requiring affirmative actions under this doctrine is too strict

### Strict Liability (No Mens Rea)

* *Morrissette v. United States* (1952) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking and selling military scrap metal in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641 “converting gov property” law (judge jury instruction that offense is SL b/c law had no culpability requirement), but D argued MOF defense that he honestly believed the government had abandoned the metal and had no intent to convert
  * Rule: **Acts which are bad in themselves, including larceny, require the element of mens rea and any similar strict liability statute will not be construed as eliminating the mens rea element**
  * Holding - Fed laws related to conversion or other wrongful acts that are silent on a required culpability element are not to be interpreted as eliminating the requirement for a culpability element. Even though there are public welfare laws intended to reduce immediate danger posed by certain actions through strict liability, larceny is a crime that has historically required mental element. Thus, this type of offense shouldn't be interpreted as a public welfare one where the statute is silent regarding intent

* *Staples v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of owning semi-automatic rifle (D’s gun had defective piece meant to prevent automatic firing) in violation of US National Firearms Act (judge jury instruction that Act makes it SL offense), but D argued MoF defense that he didn’t know it could fire automatically. SCOTUS grants cert to address issue where, absent a clear statement from Congress that there is no mens rea requirement, should federal felony statutes be interpreted the eliminate the mens rea element?
  * Rule: **Absent a clear statement from Congress that there is no mens rea requirement, federal felony statutes should not be interpreted so as to eliminate the element of mens rea**
  * Holding - Fed laws should not be interpreted as strict liability (i.e. eliminating mens rea requirement), UNLESS Congress clearly stated otherwise. Court has been careful not to interpret statutes as eliminating the mens rea requirement where seemingly innocent conduct would be criminalized. Since default rule would thus provide mens rea requirement for illegal possession of firearm, D is not culpable for unknowingly possessing an illegal firearm
  * Dissent - the Act meant for public welfare regulation similar to *Balint*

## Defenses to Culpability

* **MPC 2.04**
  1. MoF or MoL is a defense IF either:
     1. D’s MOF or MOL negates a material element of an offense (see Cordoba-Hincapie)
        * Subjective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Purposely, Knowingly, or Recklessly
        * Objective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Negligently (ie. MoF < “gross deviation”)
     1. relevant statute establishes MoF or MOL as defense to required culpability
  1. MoF or MoL for one offense does NOT transfer to another related offense, but could mitigate culpability for it
  1. Additionally, MoL is a defense IF
     1. Relevant statute not “reasonably made available” (NOTE: very low bar)
     1. D acts w/ reasonable reliance on official statement of law (NOT attorney)
  1. MoF or MoL standard is ONLY “more likely than not” NOT “beyond reasonable doubt

### Mistake of Fact

* MPC Approach
  * Mistake of fact is inseparable from mens rea analysis. Thus, it must be determined whether the mistake of fact negates required level of culpability for the material elements of the offense

* Current Law
  * MPC has had a major impact, yet some elements of the traditional approach from *Prince* continue to dominate
    * Lesser-crime principle - When D knowingly commits smaller crime, he runs risk of committing even greater crime. Thus, MoF not a valid defense in these situations
    * Moral-wrong principle - where committing an act that is morally questionable/wrong, person runs risk of committing crime
  
* *Prince* (1875) (England)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking unmarried girl under 16yo, but D argued MoF b/c reasonably believed the girl was over 16yo b/c she was 18 and she looked much older than 16
  * Holding - If statute lacks culpability requirement (ie. SL offense), then D’s MoF is not a defense
  
* *B (a minor) v. Director of Public Prosecutions* (2000) (British House of Lords)
  * Facts - D (15-yo boy) convicted of violating Indecency w/ Child Act after asking 13yo girl to perform oral sex, but D argued evidence showed he honestly believed girl was 14yo (age of consent)
  * Holding - Courts should read in a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape rape unless legislature clearly intended NOT to include one, so mistake of fact is defense to statutory rape. Holds that *Prince* is out of line with the modern trend of criminal law in which a D should be judgd on the facts as he believes them to be
  
* *Garnett v. State* (1993) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D (20yo mentally handicapped man) invited by 13yo girl (minor) to have sex.  D convicted of second degree rape (max 20 year sentence) under MD law defining it as sex between victim under 14yo and person more than four years older
  * Holding - Courts should NOT read a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape law unless the legislature clearly intended for one; so MoF is NOT defense to statutory rape. Court thinks its clear that the statute makes no allowance for a mistake-of-age defense, effectively rendering it a strict liability offense
    * This ruling goes in opposite direction than the one modern criminal law is trending towards (in which the traditional insistence on imposing strict liability for mistakes about age is beginning to erode)
  * Dissent - Not requiring state to prove necessary mental state "destroys absolutely the concept of fault" and renders meaningless the presumption of innocence and right to due process

### Mistake of Law

* Definition: A defense that D incorrectly understood how applicable law applies to their conduct
  * Traditional rule is that "ignorance of the law is no excuse" and that MoL is never a valid defense
  * This turns out to be murky and not always the case, increasingly so over the last 50 years
  
* MPC
  * §2.02(9) - Knowledge/negligence as to whether conducts constitutes an offense is not a requirement of the offense unless the definition/code specifically provides so
    * Some courts have read requirement of statutory awareness into federal statutes (e.g. *Liparota*), while others maintain that only awareness of the conduct is relevant to willfulness/knowledge (e.g. *Overholt*). The former seem to be concerned with criminalizing seemingly innocent conduct
  * §2.04 - Reflects view that punishment in official reliance MoL cases are pointless and unfair. Adopts limited defense for situation in which D reasonably relies on official interpretation (...afterwards determined to be invalid of erroneous)
  
* MoL Policy Implications
  * Arguments for barring MoL defense
    * Encourages people to know the law and disincentivizes ignorance of the law
    * Imposes duty to act cautiously and inquire about the law’s full extent (responsible citizenry)
  * Criticisms of not recognizing MoL defense
    * May impose liability w/o culpability
    * Muddled w/ MoF - unfair that D required to know law, but not required to know fact in MoF
    * Abundance modern criminal laws, difficult to know them all
    * Proposed 2015 H.R. would reform criminal code to provide broader MoL defense use in federal statute cases where law is silent. Proponents say this is a necessary safeguard against overcriminalization
  
* Circumstances in which MoL has been recognized as a valid defense
  * Specific intent crimes such as:
    * Property Damage - D reasonably believed the property damaged is his own (Smith)
    * Theft - D takes something he subjectively believed that he was entitled to or owned
    * Entrapment - if someone committed an act b/c governmental rep said it was lawful (Raley)
  
* *People v. Marrerro* (1987) (NY CoLR)
  * Facts - D (correction officers) convicted of carrying loaded firearm while off-duty in violation of statute, but D argued good faith MoL that he believed the statute exception for “peace officers” applied to correction officers. Thus, D argues that his mistaken belief about his conduct was founded upon an “official statement” of the law contained in the statute, which wsa reasonable in view of the ambiguous wording of the “peace officer” exemption, and that his “reasonable” interpretation of an “official statement” is sufficient to satisfy statutory requirements for MoL defense
  * Holding - MoL, even good faith, is not a defense. Recognizing misinterpretation of a statute would encourage ignorance of the law
  * DISSENT - “Ignorance of law is no excuse” is antiquated and impossible to follow considering the numerous laws now in existence AND D made “mistaken belief” upon an “official statement” of the statute. Rudovsky think dissent gets it right
  
* *Regina v. Smith* (1974) (England)
  * Facts - D (tenant) convicted of theft for removed wiring he had installed in the wall in violation of statute saying items installed in wall become landlord property, but D argued MoL (thought property was his) so lacked culpability
  * Holding - While MoL is NOT a defense to civil law (i.e. still liable for damage), it is a defense in criminal law because demonstrates lack of culpability

* *Cheek v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of failing to file federal income taxes, but D argued MoL b/c he believed taxes were illegal
  * Holding - Whether a good-faith MoL is sufficient to negate intent requirement of willfulness is (i) a question of fact for the jury (ii) and not subject to an objective reasonableness standard. Tax law is complicated and there must be a specific intent to violate that law. The term “willfulness” makes an exception to the rule that mistake of law is not a defense
  * Reasoning - A defendant will satisfy the willfulness requirement if she made a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.” This means that the defendant must (1) know about the duty and (2) purposely violate it. Here it is clear there was no innocent mistake and that a known duty was simply ignored out of disagreement
  
* *Lambert v. California* (1957) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of violating LA statute requiring prior-convicted felons to register, but D argued he had no knowledge of the statute
  * Holding - Due process limitations require that D be shown to know he is violating this law
    * Notice is essential component of due process and is applicable where person is wholly passive and unaware of wrongdoing. Without notice, there is no opportunity to comply and avoid the conduct
  * DISSENT - Many laws are unknown to people to whom the laws apply; Majority draws impossible constitutional line between doing and not doing

  # Rape

* Trajectory of Rape Laws
  * Rape laws do not look alike across the states. Some are more traditional and others are more modern
  * The role of the MPC has not been a significant here, states continue to adhere to their own autonomy on the issue of the actus reus of rape
  * While this section traces the progression from the traditional perspective to the modern one, this is not to say that states don’t still hold on to the entirety or pieces of the traditional perspective

## Actus Reus

### Force and Resistance

* Force Requirement
  * The traditional rule is that successful prosecution for forcible rape requires proof that:
    1. The female did not consent
    1. Sexual intercourse was secured by force
  * If there was lack of consent, but no force, a rape conviction could not be upheld
  * Notwithstanding the private threshold of unacceptable behavior, proof of force was and often still is an essential prerequisite for a criminal conviction of rape in many American jurisdictions
    * Growing number of jurisdictions (thought still a minority) now criminalize all forms of non-consensual intercourse
    * Where force is still required, those courts typically insist it must go beyond that incidental/inherent to the sexual act (something more than the sexual act itself)
  * Implicit and Nonphysical Threats
    * Under traditional doctrine, force required had to be the kind that was likely to cause serious bodily injury. Non-physical did not ordinarily constitute force
    * Courts have increasingly criticized notion of force being analogous to a fight, arguing this gives men right to intimidate and exploit fear of victims. They have also pointed out need for statutory reform in order to make room for cases where the element of physical force is lacking
    * Many states have adopted this reasoning by extending the definition of force to cases where consent is obtained by duress, coercion, extortion, or using a position of authority
    * Pennsylvania adopted statute defining "forcible compulsion" as "compulsion by use of physical, intellectual, moral, emotional or psychological force either express or applied"
  
* Resistance requirement
  * While sometimes formally required in statute, resistance requirement is more often implicit in the elements of force and non-consent
    * Traditionally, a showing of physical resistance "to the utmost" was required to establish required element of force
  * Clear policy issues with strict resistance requirement
    * Resistance can be physically dangerous to the victim. Victims of rape also frequently freeze during sexual assaults
  * Half states still require reasonable resistance, though even here there are exceptions
  * Reasonable apprehension - Requirement that, where lack of resistance out of fear, this fear be reasonably grounded. Potential justification: D should reasonably know that victim is submitting out of fear
  
* *State v. Rusk* (1981) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D met victim at bar, victim gave D a ride home and D asked her to come upstairs.  Victim declined, but D took her keys.  Victim claimed she felt scared by D’s look so she agreed to go upstairs.  Victim entered D’s apartment and did not attempt to leave before they had sex.  D denied victim’s story.  D convicted of rape, but D argued insufficient evidence of lack of consent
  * Holding - In a charge of rape, the lack of consent may be established by proof of resistance or by proof that the victim failed to resist due to a genuine and reasonably grounded fear (including, but not limited to, a fear of death or serious bodily harm, or a fear so extreme as to preclude resistance, or a fear which would render her incapable of continuing to resist, or a fear that so overpowers her that she does not dare resist). The reasonableness of P's apprehension of fear was solely a question of fact for the jury to determine. There was also the physical element of choking and the response, which might otherwise satisfy the resistance requirement
  
* *State v. DiPetrillo* (2007)(R.I.)
  * Facts - First degree sexual assault case in the context of an employer-employee relationship. Clear physical resistance. Trial judge found that between the physical actions and implied threats based on D's authority over P, all elements of the offense were satisfied.
  * Holding - Court declines to extend analysis of implied threats used in *Burke* (psychological-pressure-on-vulnerable-victim analysis in police officer case) to the context of an employment relationship. Since trial decision didn't make clear whether physical actions alone were enough to constitute force, case was remanded

### Eliminating the Force Requirement

* Many states now prohibit non-forcible forms of non-consensual sexual acts, which are divided into different degrees
  * Shift in social perspective of rape might be partially responsible for this. Rape no longer viewed exclusively as a crime of violence, but as a violation of autonomy and privacy. Invades personal inner space and abridges right to determine with whom and when to have sexual intimacy. Also viewed as degrading act of sexual domination
* Potential Concerns
  * Does this leave room for a MoF defense? If the attendant circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that they had consent, despite no verbal affirmative "yes", should they be culpable?
  
* *State in the Interests of MTS* (1992) (NJ CoLR)
  * Facts - D in victim’s bed and began having sex before victim told D to stop. Victim claimed that she was asleep when D went into her bed. D denied victim’s story. D convicted of rape, and CoA reversed on finding of no physical force
  * Holding - **A rape charge may be sustained if the victim does not affirmatively express consent verbally or physically based on a reasonable person standard even without evidence of threat or use of force**. A reasonable person would not assume that victim had given affirmative permission to D, thus trial jury finding should be upheld
  * Significance: This case is a demonstration of courts departing from the traditional rape standard requiring resistance by victim (i.e. it isn't rape unless victim fights back). Focus should be on D's behavior and courts must avoid defining “force” in such a way as to make the establishment of a crime turn on the victim’s behavior. Under this type of definition, “force” can exist if the defendant performs sexual penetration without freely-given consent. **Even the force inherent in the sexual act itself, justifies a forcible sexual assault prosecution.**
    * Under this standard, consent is the only factual issue (aside from mens rea) that would distinguish lawful conduct from ahe criminal offense
  
* *M.C. v. Bulgaria* (1998)(ECHR)
  * Facts - Victim (14yo girl) forced to have sex with D’s (two 20yo boys) and victim did not physically resist because she was too weak but verbally told them to stop several times. Bulgaria prosecutor dropped charges because insufficient evidence of physical resistance
  * Holding - Under the European Convention on Human Rights, a member state must effectively investigate and prosecute any non-consensual sexual act involving the absence of physical resistance by the victim
    * **Non-consent is the primary element of rape, NOT use of force** (consists not only of direct violence, but also placing the victim in position where submission is believed to be only option)
    * Member states should penalize any sexual act committed against non-consenting persons even if they do not shown signs of resistance. Analysis of member states shows that this definition is already widely operational
    * Rudovsky - Extraordinary case because it disregards prosecutor’s discretion to pursue or drop cases

### Absence of Consent

* Modern rape law states that force is implied by non-consent. This is consistent with the shift that took place above in which that inherent in the sexual act itself constitutes as force. Thus consent becomes the critical piece
  
* Is consent a state of mind (something person feels) or an action (something someone does or says)?
  * Subjective Consent – A female, in her mind, may want intercourse or not want it, but she may fail to manifest her wishes outwardly. There’s no need to manifest it outwardly
  * Objective Consent – Consent may be an expressive or external concept – it exists when permission is given verbally. Consent is absent without an external affirmative ‘yes’
  * Law traditionally required non-consent in both forms (subjective willingness and physical acts of refusal)
  * Nobody defends strict insistence on requirement for physical (as opposed to verbal) resistance anymore, however there still remains questions about what needs to be proved?
    * Affirmative no? Absence of a yes? Body language?
  
* Issues with Consent
  * Miscalculation - If purely subjective consent approach, potential of miscalculation by the other party arises given rise to mens rea issue
  * Involuntary Objective Consent - A person may say “yes” to sex but the degree to which this is voluntary is debateable in some instances. There may be other forces at work. Should this "yes" be enough notwithstanding the full circumstances?
  * Withdrawn Consent - Most jurisdictions hold post-penetration withdrawal of consent does not convert continuing intercourse into rape – even if threats of force are clear. This presents a clear issue

* Defective consent
  * Maturity - Statutes draw bright line by setting specific age of consent on of concerns for young person's capacity to make a mature decision (Statutory Rape)
    * Reflects social goal of deterring teen pregnancy and the risk of implicit coercion
    * Intellectual disability is another ground for invalidating consent
  * Incapacity - Liability for rape where person in unconscious or severely incapacitated by drugs or alcohol
    * Laws vary widely, though drugging or spiking someone and then have sex them is uniformly considered rape
      * Incapacitation short of unconsciousness or caused by someone other than D is not considered rape under many statutes
    * With Alcohol, general rule is that if person is unable to make reasonable judgement as to the nature/consequences of the conduct, then it is rape
  * Authority and Trust - Outside of context of psychiatrist-patient relationships, criminal law generally does not invalidate consent in adult relationships
  * Fraud
    * The law holds that that **fraud-in-the-inducement does not vitiate consent** under the common law, the law treats the intercourse as consensual
    * BUT, a female’s consent to engage in sexual intercourse is invalid if, as a result of fraud she, is unaware that she has consented to the act of sexual intercourse itself. This is called **fraud-in-factum**
      * Ex: D, a physician, is guilty of rape if he obtains permission from his patient to “insert an instrument” in her vagina while she is under anaesthesia, if the ‘instrument’ used is his penis

## Mens Rea of Rape

### Mistake of Fact

* *Commonwealth v. Sherry* (1982) (MA CoLR)
  * Facts - Victim at party with D’s (co-physicians). D’s took victim by car to one of D’s houses and had sex after the victim had asked to be taken home, but otherwise D didn’t resist. D claims she felt numb and didn’t physically resist. Ds argue that jury should have been instructed to find without a reasonable doubt that they possessed actual knowledge of victim's lack of consent
  * Holding - A rape victim is not required to use physical force to resist and any resistance which demonstrates that her lack of consent is honest and real shall suffice. There is no recognized defense related to honest mistake of fact without considering the reasonableness of the mistake
  
* *Commonwealth v. Fischer* (1998) (PA CoLR)
  * Facts - On the night of alleged sexual misconduct, D and victim had previous consensual sex. Later, D and victim met again.  Victim claims D held her down and attempted to initiate. D claims he stopped when victim said to stop and that victim left after D tried to initiate again; D claims he mistakenly thought victim consented
  * Holding - Mistake of facts on grounds that a victim previously consented to a defendant’s sexual conduct is not enough to deviate from precedent (stating that defense based on reasonable belief of consent must be established by legislature)

* Rape as a Strict Liability Offense
  * Mass. App. Ct. case in which court refused to acknowledge this defense even where belief that victim consented were reasonable. This holding was based on analogy to age based statutory rape cases
  * This may have harmful consequences. If a D genuinely and reasonably believes there is consent, then he is acting without moral culpability. The effect of dispensing with the reasonable mistake of fact doctrine is, effectively, to covert rape – a felony carrying very serious penalty – into a strict liability offense
  * This is the case in states like MA, whereas Alaska's rule is the reverse – prosecution must prove that the defendant KNEW there was no consent
  * Most states still recognize this defense where reasonable, but varies from state to state. Some states (e.g. CA) have become increasingly hesitant to instruct juries unless there is substantial evidence of conduct by female which would reasonably lead to belief of consent

## Potential Statutory Solutions

### Model Penal Code

* §213.0 Definitions
  * Consent: Person's behavior, including words and conduct (action or inaction), that communicate a willingness to engage in a specific act of sexual conduct (see *MTS*; *Bulgaria*)
  * Behavior does not constitute consent when the result of incapacity or duress
  * Consent given expressly by words OR implicitly by conduct based on circumstances
  * Lack of resistance does not establish consent, though may be considered in light of circumstances
  * Consent is revocable at any time
  * NOTE: original version wanted strict “yes” requirement, but voted as too strict and revised
  
* **§213.1 - Forcible Rape**
  1. Actor is guilty of Aggravated Forcible rape if violates forcible rape statue and in doing so recklessly or knowingly does the following in order to cause the victim to engage in the act:
     * Uses deadly weapon
     * Acts with active participation or assistance of others
     * Causes serious bodily injury
  1. Guilty of forcible rape if knowingly or recklessly does the following in order to cause the victim to engage in the act:
     * Uses physical force, physical restraint, or implied/express threat of physical force, bodily injury, or physical restraint
     * Threatens to inflict bodily injury on someone else or commit any other crime of violence

* **§213.2 - Penetration Without Consent**
  * 4th degree felony to engage in act of sexual penetration where knowingly or recklessly disregards other persons lack of consent
  
* **§213.3 - Rape or Penetration of Vulnerable Person**
  * Second degree rape of vulnerable person if engages in act of sexual penetration and knowingly/recklessly disregards that the person is:
    * Sleeping, unconscious, or physically unable to communicate
    * Unable to refuse due to mental disorder/disability
    * Unable to appraise conduct due to intoxicating/mind-altering substances the actor administered in order to cause such impairment
  * Third degree sexual penetration of vulnerable person if knowingly/recklessly disregards:
    * Mentally/developmentally disabled or otherwise mentally incapacitated so as not to understand nature of act
    * Disabled to extent that victim posses capacity person no more than 12 years old and that of actor is greater than 16
  
* **§213.4 Sexual Penetration by Coercion or Exploitation**
  1. By Coercion (third-degree felony)
     * Knowingly/Recklessly obtains consent by threatening to
       * Accuse of crime or get deported
       * Take or withhold action in official capacity (or cause another person to do so), whether public or private
       * Inflict any economic harm that would not benefit the actor
     * Obtains consent while knows or recklessly disregards that:
       * Person is detained in institution where actor holds position of authority
       * Under arrest, supervision, or in-treatment where actor holds position of authority
  1. By Exploitation (fourth degree felony)
     * Engages in act of sexual penetration and knowingly:
       * Is providing professional treatment/counseling/monitoring for emotional/mental issue to non-spousal/partner person, regardless of where it happens or if actor is qualified to provide this
       * Misrepresents medical properties of the act
       * Leads person to believe falsely that actor is personally known to them

## Evidentiary Concerns

* Evidentiary rules may be more important than the way we define rape itself
* Concern between actus rea and mens rea, as well as a pervasive concern that it is “easy” to blame someone for rape, have lead to general prescriptions relating to proof of rape that have waxed and waned over time. It is worth noting that false accusations are very rare. Rape is actually severely under-reported. However, there are still concerns about bias or leaps
  * Corroboration: “Currently, no American state requires corroboration in all forcible rape cases.” This traditionally required corroboration of victim testimony. There are theoretically arguments for corroboration in order to get a conviction – and historically this was the case – but today, defense attorneys can do the work necessary to discredit a plaintiff or suggest to the jury that the situation is murky
  * Special Jury Instruction: It used to be the case that many jurisdictions would require rape jury instructions to include a statement on how easily made rape accusations are and difficult to defend against. These have fallen out of style
  * Cross Examination: Issues of credibility and abusive treatment of victims
    * Credibility - Since availability of mistake of fact defense is limited and the standard of consent is more friendly to the victim, the obvious target of the defense is naturally the victim's credibility. The primary issue in the court room become when women should be believed and appeals to age old gender-bias are often used to sway this issue in D's favor
    * Can a plaintiff’s prior sexual history be included (or what they wore) to suggest a “loose reputation” making consent plausible?
      * Under the rules of evidence, “background circumstances like the complainant’s prior sexual experience are presumptively admissible, whenever the crucial fact (such as consent) is more likely to be true when those circumstances are present than when they are not. By this standard, it was considered plausible that evidence of prior sexual activity might sometimes have at least some probative value”
      * The difficulty with this is that introducing such evidence is likely over- weighted by juries (thus more prejudicial) or has such an effect on the alleged victim, that it’s hard to get it in or doesn’t make sense from a strategy point of view
      * Generally the probative value standard relates to CIVL rather than CRIMINAL cases. It’s harder to get it in on the criminal side
    * *State v. DeLawder* (1975)
      * Court denies admission of evidence purporting to show victim had engaged in acts with other men and that victim fabricated story out of fear of telling her mother
      * Holding: A defendant has a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to engage in cross-examination of an accuser and to introduce evidence so as to establish bias, prejudice, or ulterior motive in an attempt to diminish the accuser’s credibility.
  
* Shield Laws:
  * Just about every state has rape shield laws to limit the admissibility of evidence related to the plaintiff’s prior sexual behavior
  * **The exception is that “some state statutes admit evidence of sexual history only when it involves prior incidents with the defendant.”**
  
* Rule of Evidence 412. Any evidence of plaintiff’s sexual behavior is not allowed, EXCEPT:
  * To allow evidence to show someone other than the defendant raped the victim
  * Evidence of prior sexual behavior of the victim with the defendant to prove consent
    * *Not all states allow this*
  * Evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial
    * Example Hypo: Young woman was dating on and off the defendant. Sexual assault allegation. A week before trial, the defense attorney gets her journal diary where she says “I feel like Nate is such a player – he was trying to get with me and Holly while he had a girlfriend…maybe that’s why I jumped on him…I don’t feel too guilty for him”
      * Prosecutor says this is inadmissible…previous sex acts of plaintiff are not allowed
      * Defendant would probably argue that while this is prejudicial, it’s so relevant that not to include would be mean D doesn’t get a fair trial
* Rule of Evidence 413. A defendants (but not plaintiffs) prior sexual misconduct can be admitted.

# Homicide

* General Principles

* Two questions that apply to any category of crime:
  1. Criminality - What distinguishes criminal from non-criminal conduct?
  1. Grading - What factors greater or lesser punishment when behavior qualifies a criminal?
* Little doubt about the criminality of homicidal conduct. Instead, the central concern is to determine how much punishment can be imposed (i.e. grading)
  * Happens legislatively by dividing conduct into different names (e.g. murder v. manslaughter) and different degrees
  * Varies by state, which have different statutory schemes and classifications (e.g. PA is different than CA)

## Elements and State Legislative Grading

### Modified PA Statute

* **§2502 - Criminal Homicide**
  * Person is guilty if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of another human being
  * Shall be classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter
* **§2502 - Murder**
  * Murder of the first degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing
  * Murder of the second degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony. The felony’s that count:
    * The act of the defendant in engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.
  * Murder of the third degree - All other kinds of murder shall be murder of the third degree. Murder of the third degree is a felony of the first degree
* **§2503 - Voluntary manslaughter**
  * A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or that he intended to kill
    * Unreasonable Belief Killing Justifiable: A person who intentionally or knowingly kills an individual commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify the killing under Chapter 5 of this title (relating to general principles of justification), but his belief is unreasonable.
* **§2504 - Involuntary Manslaughter**
  * A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.

## Intended Killings

### Criteria of Most Serious Killings (i.e. First-Degree)

* 29 states and Federal system currently use criterion of "premeditation" to identify the most serious categories of murders
  * A majority of those states use *Carroll* approach where this element can be established instantaneously
  * Other states like Arizona use *Guthrie* standard and require murder be preceded length of time which permits reflection
* Types of evidence to establish premeditation as delineated in *Anderson*. Court stated that first degree murders typically involve evidence of all three and at a minimum requires strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with (1) or (3)
  1. Planning – Evidence that shows the D planned to take a life before the act will sufficiently prove premeditation and deliberateness
  1. Motive – Facts about the defendant’s prior relationship with the victim might indicate a reason to kill
  1. Manner of the Killing – Evidence that the manner of the killing was so particular and exacting that the D must have intentionally killed according to preconceived design
* Limitations and issues with premeditation as distinguishing feature of most culpable offenses
  * *Anderson* case in which an extremely gruesome child murder was committed in an enraged and violent outburst (i.e. without premeditation) is intuitively more culpable that dispassionate planned killing
  * Mercy killings would also likely fall into category of most serious killings under this standard
  * As a response, MPC along with some states have rejected premeditation as basis for identifying most serious murders

* *Commonwealth v Carroll* (Pa. 1963) - Instantaneous Premeditation
  * Facts: Appeal of a felony murder conviction in the first degree, the argument is that murder was a crime a passion – not enough premeditation here. 1st degree murder, arguing it’s 3rd degree. D argues that his mental disorders, as well as the previous context of the relationship, got him to the point where he didn’t think – he just acted instinctively
  * Issue: How much premeditation is required for 1st degree murder? What evidence is needed to show that element of premeditation was or was not present?
  * Rule: **Premeditation can happen in an instant. Whether the intention to kill arose within a brief time before the act is immaterial**. It wasn’t planned in the typical way we might think of premeditation, but it can be instantaneous
  * Notes:
    * Court appears to be suggesting that an act that is deliberate is necessarily premeditated. However, premeditation refers quantity of time required to deliberate (the quality of that thinking ahead). Court suggests that the quantity of time can be close to instantaneous before a crime is committed if attendant circumstances indication deliberation
    * “The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a defendant’s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances together with all reasonable inference therefrom”… it can happen in an instant"
    * “Society would be almost completely unprotected from criminals if the law permitted a bling or irresistible impulse or inability control one’s self to excuse or justify a murder or to reduce it from first degree to second degree”
  
* *State v Guthrie* (W. Va. 1995) - Period of Reflection
  * Facts: At issue is a jury instruction for first degree murder and whether the instruction that “it is not necessary that the intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time prior to the actual killing” was a correct interpretation of premeditation
  * Rule: In conflict with *Carrol*, **premeditation can’t be instantaneous or near instantaneous**. Otherwise, if the State prove premeditation by only showing that intention came into existence for the first time at the time of killing, then it effectively eliminates the distinction between the degrees. Thus, there must be some evidence that D considered and weighed his decision to kill in order to establish premeditation
  * Notes:
    * Court emphasizes the requirement for a period between formation of intent and the actual act in order to establish premeditation. Need an opportunity to reflect and contemplate the act to kill
      * Several arguments for this requirement: Makes act more culpable, harder to deter, and smaller likelihood of getting caught. Each of these arguably make crime more serious and justifying a different grade

### Mitigation of Intentional Killings (i.e. Manslaughter)

* Approaches to provocation as a mitigating factor
  * Predominate common law position that there are only a few specific circumstances that can serve as adequate provocation and mitigate from first degree murder downward. If you take the *Giroard* approach, it seems counter-intuitive that words alone can’t provoke people sufficiently, after all people can say truly horrible things. However, it might be the case that there’s a concern this doctrine might be abused and present a pretext for people to justify killings
  * *Mather* holds that provoking circumstances need not conform to any pre-established categories - it’s a jury question based on the facts. While this remains minority view, a number of American jurisdictions follow it
  
* Excuses, Justifications, and Cooling Off Period as Basis for Provocation Defense
  * Justification
    * Focuses on the wrongfulness of the act in light of the circumstances. Actor is treated as fully responsible agent, but what the actor did is treated as, at a minimum, not entirely wrong
    * Classic example is something like self-defense; I’m protecting my child, I was justified in killing after I found out the abuse has been happening. Wanted to prevent further abuse
    * Not a full defense, but certainly a partial one that mitigates
    * "Implicit claim in partial justification is that it is to some extent morally justified to make punitive return against someone who causes actor serious offence"
  * Excuse
    * Excuse focuses on the culpability of the actor. When we say an actor is excused, we condemn the act but forgive him merely because of his reduced capacity
    * Classic example is the heat of the moment. Anybody would kill immediately if it happened to them. The act was bad, but D wasn’t in full control – he was killing out of understandable fury that is excused
    * "Provocation must be estimated by the probability that the circumstances would affect most men in like fashion...the greater the provocation measured that way, the more ground there is for attributing the intensity of the actor's passions and lack of self-control...to the extraordinary character in the situation he was placed in."
  * Cooling Off Period - Often courts are forced in these mitigation contexts to determining if there was so-called cooling off. If D kills right when he is provoked, that’s one thing. But if D had time to cool off and recollect himself, then provocation can’t properly mitigate. But how much cooling off time disqualifies?
    * If you view provocation as a partial justification, you look at the conduct of the victim, not the killer. Cooling off doesn’t matter, the victim child abuser did something wrong
    * If you view provocation as an excuse, then cooling off period matters. Acting in the heat of the moment counts as excuse only if it’s in the heat of the moment
  
* *Girouard v. State* (Md. 1991) - Strict, categorical approach
  * Facts: D kills W after being thrown into a mad frenzy based on her means words during an argument. D was convicted of second-degree murder, but argues that it should be mitigated to manslaughter, despite not falling into any of the recognized categories to which mitigation applies, because it lacks the malice essential for a murder conviction
  * Issue: Should the circumstances mitigate murder to manslaughter? Most states only allow mitigation for provoking circumstances like assault, mutual combat, injury/abuse of a close relative, sudden discovery of adultery
  * Rule: Provocation, to be adequate, must be calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the movement out of passion rather than reason. **Mere words are not alone enough to provoke and therefore mitigate, must be paired with conduct indicating intention to commit harm**
  * Notes:
    * Court takes a categorically strict approach, there’s a dividing line between conduct and words
    * Court says that other jurisdictions overwhelmingly agree with holding that words are not provocation
    * Standard is one of reasonableness, should not focus on peculiar frailties of D
  
* *Mather v People* (1862) – Broad view
  * Facts: Old case. Does hearing of a spouse’s infidelity mitigate the passionate rage that could result leading to homicide? How far does it mitigate?
  * Rule: Hearing of spousal infidelity is a reasonable reason to mitigate. Prefers to kick whether something can mitigate to a jury rather than make it a determination of law. Determining sufficiency of provocation should assume the disposition of a reasonable person of ordinary temperment

### MPC Approach to Mitigation of Intentional Killings

* In order to mitigate from homicide to manslaughter under the MPC, you therefore need two things:
  1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance
  1. There is a Reasonable Explanation as to why the defendant acted as he did

* Altogether, around 20 states employ some version of the EED test
  * States vary in the formulation of this test, with some still requiring act of provocation
  * Empirical evidence suggest these defenses are rarely successful under strict adoptions of the MPC approach

* Given that the MPC lays out a subjective and objective element of the doctrine, the question is how and to what degree should we condition on the individual characteristics of the defendant?
  * First Ask – Is a Person in a State of Extreme Emotional Disturbance?
    * Purely subjective, a jury can consider all the personal characteristics that might predispose them to such a state. The jury will have to consider whether they believe the psychiatrist or expert with regard to their state
  * Then Ask – It is reasonable for that person to be in an extreme emotional disturbance state?
    * Mixed subjective, mixed objective test
      1. Immutable factors (like disability, mental deficiency) COUNT, they help define the person’s mind and degree of reasonableness
      1. Social factors (like religion, homophobia) DO NOT COUNT, having a particular emotional belief does not make an action sufficient
    * The question becomes:
      1. What is something looks like an immutable OR social factor

* Limitations
  * Does not recognize moral, ethnic or political beliefs as part of "actor's situation"
  * How do both CL and MPC approaches deal with cultural norms, trauma, mental disorder, age/sex based factors, etc? (pg 486-88)

* *People v. Casassa* (N.Y. 1980)
  * Facts: Victim’s rejection of D cause him prolonged emotional distress (i.e. intense heartbreak) leading him to murder the victim. D argues that at time of offense, he was under influence of extreme emotional disturbance which should mitigate the charge
  * Rule: New York adopts the MPC on this issue and the two part test for mitigation. The court decides that:
    1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance = Subjective Test. Involves a determination that the particular D did in fact act under extreme emotional disturbance
    1. Reasonable Explanation = Objective Test. Must be a "reasonable" explanation for the actor's disturbance based on the external circumstances as the actor understood them at the time
  * Notes:
    * Court says the purpose of this defense is to show actions were caused by mental infirmity, though less serious than that of insanity, making them less culpable for having committed the offense
    * D argues that given his unique mental state and unusual sensitivity to being rejected, you’ve got to use a subjective test to determine emotional disturbance. And there’s some strength to this position, the MPC says it’s about the “viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances he believes them to be”
    * The court argues that there’s got to be an objective portion to the emotional disturbance aspect. In this regard, court found that the unusual sensitivity was so peculiar to D that it is unworthy of mitigation under this standard of reasonableness

## Unintentional Killings

### Civil vs. Criminal Liability

* *Commonwealth v. Welansky* (Mass. 1944)
  * Facts: Nightclub fire killing people. Question is whether the proprietor, who wasn’t even present or in management at the time of the fire, engaged in conduct that was wanton or reckless and thus committed involuntary manslaughter. Though conduct did not consist of any affirmative act, could it still constitute as reckless vs merely negligent?
  * Rule: **Reckless can be distinguished from negligence in terms of wilfulness. While result is not intended, the conduct causing such harm must have been intended in light of some awareness of the grave dangers it posed to other (i.e. run the risk). However, if actor is so heedless that he did not realize the grave dangers posed by his conduct, then he cannot escape imputation of recklessness if a reasonable man would have realized this danger**
  * Notes
    * Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable consequences to others
    * These terms express a difference in the degree of risk in the voluntary undertaking - substantial departure from behavior of ordinary man
  
* **MPC Approach**
  * Creates two crimes - manslaughter and lesser crime of negligent homicide - which are distinguished by awareness of unwarranted risk
  * Manslaughter if actor was "reckless", meaning he "**consciously** disregarded substantial and unjusifiable risk of conduct causing death to another"
  * Killing is negligent only where he **should** have been aware of such risks

### Distinguishing Murder from Manslaughter

* Definitions of Unintended Killings as Murder
  * Common law formulations for which unintentional killings constituted murder have been incorporated into statutes or by reference to terms like malice (See *Malone*), which rely on epithets such as "the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart"
  * Many other state statutes use formulations inspired by the MPC approach, in which unintended killings are murder when committed recklessly and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. This omits the common-law language of how wicked or depraved the killing is
  
* *Commonweatlth v. Malone* (Pa. 1946)
  * Facts: Person dies playing Russian Roulette. The man organizing the game thought it was completely safe – he put one bullet in the chamber and in way that would not go off until five shots. But it happened anyway
  * Rule: Common law's grand criterion for distinguishing murder from other killing was malice on the part of the killer. Malice defined as "any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked...heart". Court holds that when an individual commits acts of gross recklessness which they must reasonably anticipate the death of another is likely, they exhibit this disposition of wickedness. A specific motive isn't always necessary. This case clearly shows a high level of recklessness for which malice is evidenced
  
* *United States v. Fleming*
  * Facts: Heavily drunk driving D swerving into oncoming traffic to avoid congestion and strikes/kills driver of another vehicle
  * Rule: Malice is distinguishing feature distinguishing murder from manslaughter. To sustain murder conviction, **must simply prove that D intended to operate car with a heart that was without regard for life and safety of others**. Difference between malice and gross negligence is one of degree. Facts of this case show deviation from ordinary standards of regard for human life/safety than that of ordinary vehicular homicides. Thus, murder conviction sustained

---

## Felony Murder

### Basic Doctrine

* Classic formulation of the felony-murder doctrine
  * Declares that one is guilty of murder if a death results from conduct during the commission or attempted commission of any felony.” Effectively a strict liability approach where intention to kill or foreseeability is not relevant (at least in the U.S.)
  * Many current murder statutes provide that death that results from the commission of specifically listed felony – such as arson, rape, robbery, or burglary – constitutes first-degree murder for which the maximum penalty is death or life imprisonment
    * If a death results from the commission of an unspecified felony, it is a second degree murder
  * The rule is heavily criticized and even banned in many continental countries

* *Reginia v Serne* (England 1887) – **Felony Murder Narrow Rule**
  * Facts: Old case in which a man allegedly sets fire to his house to collect insurance money and accidentally kills his son
  * Rule: The court approaches the rule narrowly. “I think that that, instead of saying that any act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to murder, it would be reasonable to say that **any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death should be murder**”
  * Notes:
    * Malice is proven by the commission of the felony itself. However, no clear proof in this case that D actually set fire, so not-guilty verdict
    * Became dominant standard of English common law

* *People v. Stamp* (Cal. 1969) - **Broad Felony Murder Rule**
  * Facts: In the process of D robbing a store, one of the clerks dies of a heart attack due to the stress of the situation. The man was 60 years old, obese, and had a history of heart disease. The question is whether the man’s death was too attenuated to sustain a conviction given his background
  * Rule: Doctrine is not limited to instances where deaths are foreseeable. **Ds are held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or accomplices in the course of a felony as long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the felony and regardless if it were foreseeable or the natural/ordinary result of it**
  * Notes: Extends much further than formulation in *Regina*, which still requires some culpability with respect to the killing (i.e. narrow doctrine does not apply to purely accidental killings)
    * This broad, unqualified felony-murder rule was adopted in the U.S. and is generally accepted in American courts. No proof of mens rea required

### Implications of Felony Murder Doctrine

* Doing Away with Mens Rea Requirement?
  * The felony-murder rule seems to facially apply as to whether a felon kills the victim whether or not it’s done so intentionally, recklessly, negligently, or accidentally, and unforeseeably. Does this mean felony-murder creates a strict liability rule?
    * In a sense it does, some courts candidly suggest that felony-murder rule dispenses with the requirement of malice. But the more common rationale is that the intent to commit the felony – itself a frequently life threatening act – constitutes the implied malice required for common law murder
    * Examples:
      * D1 is robber is guilty of murder if V1 dies from fright caused by robbery
      * D2 is guilty of murder if she accidentally shoots V2 in the chest during commission of a felony, and V2 dies years later from a heart attack during a baseball game (causation not entirely clear though)
      * D3 is guilty of murder if she attempts to steal V3’s watch from V3’s purse and a gun concealed in it discharges, killing V3.
    * Implicitly (and often explicitly by statute) the felony murder rule applies to accomplices in the commission of felonies.
* Does not do away with actus reus requirement - Causation requirement
  * Must be shown that D's conduct caused a person's death
  * Common formulation contains both "but for" and proximate (natural and ordinary result) causation requirements
  * Foreseeability still factors into the proximate cause prong
* Rationale for the Rule - Given criticisms above, consider the following arguments for it:
  * Deterrence: Most common defense of rule is that it intends to deter negligent and accidental killings during the commission of felonies
    * Counterargument: How does one deter an unintended act? The act of committing a felony might be intended, but the result death is unintended
  * Sanctity of Human Life: Some argue that it reaffirms the sanctity of human life, asserting it reflects society’s judgement that the commission of a felony resulting in death is more serious – and therefore deserves greater punishment – than the commission of a felony not resulting in death
    * Counterargument: Even if true, it doesn't follow that a felon who accidentally takes a life should be subject to the severe penalties, including death and life imprisonment, reserved for ordinary murderers. It is unfair to increase a felon’s punishment for the social harm of death that may have been caused unintentionally, non-recklessly, non-negligently
    * Transferred Intent: The argument here is that the felon’s intent to commit a felony is transferred to the homicide via the Transferred Intent Doctrine
      * Counterargument: Misconstrues the transferred intent doctrine. That doctrine provides that an actor’s intention to commit a particular social harm relating to a particular victim may be transferred to a different unintended victim of the SAME social harm. The law does not generally recognize a transference of intent to cause one social harm to a different and greater harm
    * Easing the Prosecutor’s Burden of Proof: Malice Aforethought  can be a tough standard to prove. Argument that felony-murder doctrine is there to ease the prosecutor’s burden of proof but dispensing of the requirement that she show that the felon intended to kill or injure the victim grievously or that the felon was aware that her conduct was highly dangerous
      * Counterargument: Doing away with mens rea can be lead to problematic outcomes

### Inherently Dangerous Felony Limitation

* In response to the above critiques, many states limit the felony murder rule to homicides that occurred during the commission of a felony, with the underlying felony being one dangerous to human life
* Two approaches:
  1. **Abstract Approach** – Courts, though only in a few American jurisdiction, consider the felonies in the abstract. That is, to determine whether a felony is inherently dangerous, a court will ignore the facts of the specific case and, instead, consider the elements of the offense in the abstract. This can demand a lot more by setting a high bar for holding an offense inherently dangerous
     * Example: In the abstract approach, the felony offense of “being a felon in possession of a firearm” is not inherently dangerous, whereas use of a firearm by a former felon is inherently dangerous
     * Example: In on case, false imprisonment was held as not inherently dangerous in the abstract because the elements of fraud and deceit do not involve endangering conduct
  2. **Facts of the Case Approach** – Most jurisdictions employ approach that allows a felony to qualify if it is committed in a dangerous way. Thus, it considers the felony as committed in order to make a determination of the danger posed. "[I]f the felonious conduct, under all of the circumstances, made death a foreseeable consequence."
     * Argues that the abstract approach undermines one of the primary purposes of the modern felony murder rule, namely "to deter dangerous conduct by punishing as murder a homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in perpetuation of a felony."
* What is the problem with the inherently dangerous felony rule?
  * The concerns is that the limitation brings felony murder close to the depraved-heart or extreme-recklessness concept of malice. A felony the commission of which is likely to result in death is a crime the commission of which is apt to demonstrate overlap with the mens rea of recklessness/negligence
  * Now, it is theoretically possible to not consciously take a risk as the reckless standard demands and fall under felony murder, but this seems few and far between

* *People v Phillips* (Cal. 1966) - Abstract approach
  * A doctor was convicted of second degree murder for advising homeopathic remedy to a cancer rather than treatment which led to a little girl’s death. He (falsely) represented he could cure her and took money for this treatment. The court reversed because this theft by deception wasn’t inherently dangerous to life. **It held that only those felonies which are (abstractly) inherently dangerous to human life can support a felony murder charge**

* *Hines v. State* (Ga. 2003) - Circumstantial approach
  * Man accidentally shot a friend dead during a hunting accident and was charged with second degree murder because he had committed a felony possession of a firearm as a former convict. **Court rules that a felony is inherently dangerous when it is dangerous "per se" or "by its circumstances create a foreseeable risk of death"**. Court upheld conviction because the charge of illegal felony possession of a firearm was sufficiently dangerous, as it created foreseeable risk of death

### Merger Doctrine Limitation

* A felony murder only applies if the predicate (underlying) felony is independent of, or collateral to, the homicide. If the felony is not independent, then the felony is said to merge with the homicide and thus felony-murder would be inappropriate (unless the independent felony is of the type that can sustain felony murder conviction)
* **Two tests are commonly used 1) whether the felony is "included in fact" in the homicide or 2) whether the felony is independent of homicide (independent purpose test)**
  * Independent purpose rule prevents truly independent felonies from collapsing into the killing itself, allowing D to circumvent felony-murder instructions
* Rationale:
  * The great majority of states acknowledge some need of merger doctrine in order to ensure that felony-murder does not obliterate grading distinctions the legislature seems to have desired
    * Effect of failing to merge would mean that all intentional killings accomplished by means of a deadly weapon could NEVER be mitigated to manslaughter, as killing was committed in commission of felonious assault
* Many grade homicides by stating that if a death occurs during commission of a specifically listed felony, then the death constitutes first-degree felony- murder, whereas a death resulting during the commission of any other felony – not specifically enumerated – constitutes second-degree felony murder
  * For example, aggravated child abuse is specifically listed in Florida’s first degree felony murder statute. Therefore, although the abuse involves assaultive conduct, the merger rule does not apply to this offense in Florida.

* *People v Burton* (Cal. 1971) – Merger Doctrine Independent Purpose
  * Facts: Armed robbery that leads to a conviction for first degree felony murder. D appeals and argues charge be reduced to a lesser degree (reckless homicide) because the underlying felonious conduct was an armed assault which merges with the killing (i.e. no independent felony to support felony murder instruction). Prosecutor argues that the purpose of robbery is theft, not assault and therefore should not merge because of it's independent purpose
  * Rule: The court agrees, the two crimes don’t merge into one and D can be charged with robbery and with felony-murder. **Deaths resulting from felonies undertaken for a purpose independent of the homicide support a charge of felony murder**. The purpose of the felony murder is to deter felons from killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible for killings they commit in execution of an underlying, independent felony. Allowing robbery charge to merge would allow D to escape legislatively intended grading
  * Cases Distinguished:
    * *Wilson* - Underlying felony supporting felony murder instruction was burglary with intent to assault. Court in this case held because the object of burglary was assault with a deadly weapon, there was no independent felonious purpose thus the underlying felony merges with the killing and prosecution must show malice/deliberation associated with 1st degree murder. However, in *Burton* object of robbery is not assault, but to obtain money/valuables. Thus, there is an independent purpose and felony murder instruction appropriate

* *People v Robertson* (Notes): V tries to steal D’s hubcaps, D shoots attempting to scare him, but accidentally kills him. Can there be felony murder?
  * Ironically arguing defense that killing wasn't intentional, only intended to scare, D establishes there was an independent purpose and avoids merger, opening himself to felony murder. Dissenting judges here recognize that this is clearly a problem as more culpable actors have better legal standing under this doctrine

* *People v. Chun* - Similar facts as *Robertson* where killings were committed with intent to scare. Court overturns *Robertson*, holding that wherever the offense is assaultive in nature (involves immediate threat of injury), it merges with killing and is not basis for felony murder instruction. However, the recklessness in this case was so clear as to establish elements required for traditional murder

### Killing Not in Furtherance of the Felony

* Felony murder rule can only apply when the act of killing is done **in furtherance** of the underlying felony. This is usually clear, but not always. Two types of situations where questions arise:
  1. Lethal acts committed *after* the felony and are arguably unrelated
  1. Lethal acts committed in resistance to the felony
* Two approaches to the latter category - acts committed by non-felons in resistance to underlying crime
  * **The “Proximate Cause” Approach** - A felon is liable for any death that is proximate result of the felony, even if the shooter is not one of the felons. This is a very fact specific approach, it depends on the circumstances
    * Rationale: When a felon’s attempt to commit a foreseeable felony sets in motion a chain of events which were or should have been within his contemplation when the motion was initiated, he should be held responsible for any death which by direct and inevitable sequence is a result”
      * F1 and F2 hold up a liquor store. F1 fires at X to scare him and X fires back, killing F1 and accidentally killing V. F2 is likely guilty of felony murder under this approach
  * **The “Agency” Approach** - A majority of states take this approach, which provides that the felony does not extend to a killing, although growing out of the commission of the felony, if directly attributable to the act of one other than the defendant or those associated with him in the unlawful enterprise
    * **In other words, the felony-murder rule does not apply if an adversary to the crime, rather than the felon, personally commits the homicidal act**
    * Rationale: A person should not be responsible for the actions of others not associated with the conspiracy. A felon who does not shoot anyone (F2) is not responsible for the actions a non-shooter (X)
    * However, if X was the accomplice of F1 and F2, then F2 could get felony murder for F1 and V
  
* *People v Gillis*: Man is robbing house, is caught, and fleas. 15 minutes later, as the man is fleeing, a trooper spots the car and begins pursuit. In pursuit the man hits another car, killing two people
  * Felony Murder? Yes. **If necessary to complete the commission of a crime, then it is "in furtherance" of the felony**
    * Still raises questions - suppose D had lost the police and stopped to grab something to eat before resuming his drive?
  
* *People v Cabatero*: A gang is committing robbery. A lookout panics at an approaching car and shoots at it. Angered by the lookouts stupidity, the gang leader shoots the lookout. The gang leader can be charged with murder, but the other robbers?
  * Felony Murder? Yes, **because this act was a part of protecting the underlying illegal operation in which the other members were involved in**. If the victim had killed a police officer approaching, then felony murder would apply because it was in furtherance of the crime (i.e. prevent getting caught)
    * But if a felon does something not related to the furthering the crime, then felony murder doesn’t apply to others
    * Note: This also relies on accomplice liability, which is another issue altogether
  
* *State v. Canola* (N.J. 1977)
  * Facts - D and others robbed a jewelry store, and one of D’s co-felons and the store owner killed by another of D’s co-felons. D convicted of first-degree murder under FMR, but D argued “agency” theory precluded felony-murder rule
  * Holding - Felony murder rule does not apply to the death of a co-felon under agency approach

## Death Penalty

### Issues, Developments, and Policy Considerations

* Death Penalty is expensive to administer
  * Significantly greater investigative, trial, and appeal costs
  * In NC, it costs over $2 million per execution more than if it were just to impose life sentence
* MPC has withdrawn death penalty (not officially endorsing or opposing it) b/c of the “current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment”
* Still has public support, though lower than its peak
  * Trending downward
  * Subject to little regional variation, but extent to which penalty is carried out widely differ
* Number of states recently moved away
  * 7 states made it illegal, 21 more have proposed its repeal, others have undertaken reviews of the process
  
* **Primary considerations are related to the animating principles of criminal law and theories of punishment**
  * Deterrence
    * As long as people believe that death penalty is worse than life sentence, it should have a deterrent effect (in theory)
      * Counterargument that it has "brutalization effect" promoting violence to deal with problems and thus increasing murder rate
    * Empirical evidence is inconclusive
      * Raises question of how sure do we need to be of deterrent effect in order to justify using capital punishment?
  * Retribution
    * Kantian defense rests on the principle of equality, the basis for the biblical principle of lex talonis ("an eye for an eye")
      * This is compelled by, and according to Kant is consistent with, the CI
    * Expressive function, though this seems to have an end that falls outside pure retribution
  
* Error and Bias
  * Is risk of error inherently less acceptable in capital sentencing due to the significance of its implications?
    * Can't simply correct it after innocent person has been executed
    * To what extent to improved forensic technologies alleviate this concern? In reality, this probably doesn't make a significant difference as it is rarely available and subject to error itself
    * Counterargument that concerns about protecting the innocent are given too much weight and the risk must be accepted in order to achieve benefits of the death penalty
  * Argument that disproportionate racial or economic bias that is systemic in the administration of capital punishment
    * Consider poor defendants who can't afford adequate legal representation or black defendants subject to discrimination
  
* Constitutional Limitations
  * Procedural Due Process under 5th and 14th Amendments
    * SCOTUS, in *McGautha*, rejects argument that life-or-death sentencing decisions needs to follow some explicit criteria in order to comport with due process. Instead, due process is consistent with leaving these decisions to the unguided discretion of judges and juries
  * 8th Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment
    * SCOTUS ruled shortly after in *Furman* that capital punishment is it was administered then (1972) was a violation of protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Forced states to quickly adopt new legislation clarifying sentencing criteria (either by re-writing laws to (1) make death penalty mandatory for certain crimes OR (2) standardize guidelines for jury sentencing)
  
* Guided discretion and mandatory sentencing
  * New statutory schemes adopted in TX, GA, and FL post *Furman* were upheld. These required sentencing authority weigh certain factors, yet did not impose mandatory imposition of death sentence, ultimately leaving decision to jury
  * Court later held mandatory capital sentencing were inconsistent with standards of decency and thus remained unconstitutional. They argued this schemes fail to address concerns from *Furman* of unchecked and unguided jury, especially when they felt sentence was inappropriate. Individualized sentencing, where all possible mitigating factors are considered, is necessary (*Woodson* and *Locket*)
  * *Woodson* and *Lockett* decisions, where mitigating factors to be considered cannot be limited to those specifically enumerated in the statute, seems to conflict with *Furman* decision arguing the need for structure and less arbitrariness in sentencing guidelines. Also concerns about the excessive time needed for this detailed procedural review and how the time it forces D to spend on death row are irreconcilable with goals of punishment
  
* Limitations
  * Declared unconstitutional under 8th Amendment where disproportional to the offense, such as rape (*Coker*)
  * Capital sentencing for the mentally disabled ruled to be unconstitutional in *Atkins*
    * Criteria for determining when this applies is unclear, as is standard of proof necessary to establish intellecutal disability

# Exculpation

* 3 distinct sorts of defenses can be invoked to bar conviction for an alleged crime:
  1. Assertion that prosecution has failed to establish one or more required elements of the offense
  1. Justification - Affirmative defense that D acted properly
  1. Excuse - Affirmative defense that while the act is not condoned, D’s responsibility is mitigated
* Justification and excuse are different from the first insofar as they don't seek to refute any require element of prosecution's case; rather they suggest considerations that negate liability even when all elements are present

## Justification - Self Defense

* When the use of defensive force against an aggressor is necessary to protect the actor from seriously bodily harm, that action is justified - it was the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances
  * However, court in *Peterson* states widely accepted view that it **isn't required that use of force be truly necessary**; it is available when the **actor reasonably believes defensive force to be necessary**
  * If it turns out that force wasn't truly necessary and reasonable belief was false, then it is more precise to say that the actor is excused; the action was not right, but the mistake was reasonable. Regardless of the label (usually labeled as a justification), one who satisfies the self-defense requirement is entitled to acquittal

* **MPC 3.04**
  * (1) Force justifiable if D subjectively believes it is "immediately necessary for purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force"
  * (2)
    * (a) Force is NOT justifiable if:
      * (i) D knowingly resists lawful arrest
      * (ii) D knowingly resists force of person protecting their property
    * (b) Use of **deadly** force is only justifiable if actor believes force is necessary to protect against death/serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or forced sexual intercourse. It is also unjustified if:
      * (i) Actor provoked the use of force against him in the same encounter with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm (i.e. is the initial aggressor)
      * (ii) Actor knows he can avoid necessity of using such force with safety by retreating, surrendering property, or complying with demands that he abstain from some action. Exceptions:
        * (1) Not obliged to retreat from dwelling or place of work unless he was initial aggressor or is assailed by co-worker
    * (c) Other than in subsections (a) and (b), person using protective force may estimate its necessity under the circumstances as he believes them to be without surrender or retreat
  
* **Battered Women's Syndrome**
  * Different subcultures of violence between the sexes. When women do kill, it frequently targeted towards an abusive spouse or partner. In these cases, it is not uncommon for D to assert defense of self-defense on the basis of history of physical and mental abuse and the associated trauma
  * We see this in two forms
    * Confrontational homicides - Woman kills partner amidst battering incident. This is most common and primary issue becomes whether D is entitled to introduce history of abuse evidence and expert testimony
    * Non-confrontational homicides - Battered woman kills abuser in his sleep. Here the issues are related to (1) the imminent threat requirement and whether D is entitled to jury instruction on self defense absent some aggressive act by the abuser; and (2) can BWS evidence and testimony be introduced to show that D reasonably subjectively believed such actions were necessary to combat imminent deadly assault. Courts are divided here
    * Evidence of prior abuse not ordinarily allowed - the victim is not the one on trial and it improperly focuses jury in his character. However, it's now common to allow battered women to introduce evidence to support defense claim. It makes sense in cases where actions were not overtly threatening, but prior history is relevant to show actor reasonably feared for her life. A reasonable person in her shoes would surely take such history of abuse into consideration in determining whether threat is deadly
  * Expert testimony - Gives D credibility as to her subjective belief and objective belief of similarly situated reasonable person
    * Any testimony is inadmissible in criminal case unless:
      * Subject matter is beyond the grasp of a lay person
      * Expert has sufficient knowledge/experience to aid jury in search for truth
      * The subject matter is such that it permits a reasonable opinion to be asserted by an expert (i.e. not something like phrenology or a novel/undeveloped science)
    * Varies by state and standard used by state to evaluate the reasonableness of the perceived threat

### *People v. Goetz* (1986 NY)

* Facts: Man approached on subway by unarmed 4 men attempting to rob him (two have them had screwdrivers). He shot and wounded all four of them with an unlicensed hand gun. He later admitted he didn't think the robbers had weapons but was afraid of being jumped because he had been mugged before. After indictment, D attempted to get dismissed the assault and attempted murder charges, contending that jury was improperly instructed to apply "reasonable man" standard. The court granted this dismissal, holding the objective element included in the instructions was erroneous
* Issue: Is a person justified in using deadly force in self-defense if he subjectively believed such force was necessary to prevent an attack or a robbery? Or must there be objectively reasonable belief under the circumstances?
* Rule: **A person is justified in using deadly force in self-defense or defense of another only if she objectively and reasonably believes an attacker is either (1) using or about to use deadly force or (2) committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy, or robbery**
* Holding: Grand jury was properly instructed; dismissal overturned and charges re-instated
  * The right to use deadly force in self-defense has contained an element of objective reasonableness from the days of the common law
  * Legislature in NY State specifically rejected MPC approach of allowing subjective mistaken belief that motivated use of force to negate intent requirement, thus only allowing negligent/reckless homicide
  * The repeated references to reasonableness are proof of the legislative intent that there be **an objectively reasonable basis for the belief** (only then will mistaken belief be justified)
  * Court not persuade that objective standard would preclude taking circumstances into consideration; **courts may still consider the situation, including the defendant’s knowledge and prior experience, in determining whether the belief was reasonable**

### *State v. Kelly* (1984 NJ)

* Facts: D's husband beat and abused her for years. One day, D's husband attacked her in public and ran at her with his arms raised in a menacing nature. Not knowing if he was armed, D stabbed and killed her husband with scissors. She was charged with murder, and claimed self-defense. At trial, D's counsel called an expert witness on battered woman's syndrome, but the court determined her testimony was inadmissible. The jury convicted D of reckless manslaughter, a lesser charge. D appealed, claiming that the expert’s testimony should have been admitted at trial.
* Issue: Should the testimony have been allowed?
* Rules:
  * **Expert testimony on battered women's syndrome is admissible in the trial because if it is relevant to D's claim self-defense**
  * **Use of force in self-defense is only justified if the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for purpose of protecting themselves against use of unlawful force by such other person**
* Holding - Testimony should have been admissible; conviction is overturned and case remanded
  * Expert testimony on battered woman syndrome is relevant because it relates to D's claim of self-defense
    * Her defense claim is only justified if she reasonably believed force was necessary to protect herself against serious harm
  * Recurrent abuse and effects of battered woman's syndrome would have impacted D's reasonable belief about the threat of harm posed by the circumstances
    * "Combination of all these symptoms, resulting from sustained psychological and physical trauma compounded by aggravating social and economic factors, constitutes the battered woman's syndrome"
    * If not for D's status as a battered woman, this belief might not be reasonable
  * Battered woman's syndrome is also an appropriate subject for expert testimony. Despite the fact that the field is relatively new, the expert was sufficiently qualified. The question of whether the testimony is scientifically reliable is best left answered by the trial court
* Notes:
  * Court says BWS evidence is relevant to question of reasonableness, but the extent to which may be limited. Similar cases have provided further illumination on the standard of reasonableness
    * CA Supreme Court in *Humphrey* - Objective reasonableness must view the situation from D's perspective, though this is not changing the standard to a subjective one or a objective battered woman standard. Testimony can help jury overcome biases and misunderstandings which is relevant to how they view the evidence and how D perceived circumstances (also allowing them to better evaluate credibility of D). However, ultimate question is response of reasonable person under those circumstances
    * *Romero* - CA court property refused to instruct jury to use subjectivity in applying the standard or to apply a reasonable battered person standard
    * A few other courts have moved closer to a fully subjective standard, some going as far to consider if a person who had assumed psychological peculiarities of D would have reasonable belief under the circumstances (e.g. ND). Others have applied something like a reasonable battered person standard (e.g. MO)
      * Arguments have been advanced that purely objective standard of reasonableness is unfair because it cannot be possibly be met by D because such a reasonable person does not have her perspective or history of experiencing violence and psychological trauma. On the other hand, completely subjective standard removes the normative component by introducing a form of moral relativism
  
### *State v. Norman* (1989 NC)

* Facts: D was abused, physically and psychologically, by her husband for most of their 25 year marriage. Some of the abuse incidents were extremely severe, leading to a suicide attempt. After being beat particularly bad, D shot husband while he was asleep. She was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, but appealed citing BWS as a defense and CoA reversed and remanded for new trial with jury being instructed of the defense. State appeals to NC Supreme Court
* Rules:
  * **D is entitled to have jury consider acquittal by reason of perfect self-defense when evidence (viewed in most favorable light) tends to show that at time of the killing, D believed it was necessary to kill to save themselves from imminent bodily harm**
  * Imperfect self-defense, which reduces culpability, is also recognized where victim escalates confrontation to point where it reasonably appears to D killing is necessary to prevent serious harm
* Holding: D was not entitled to perfect or imperfect self-defense
  * Killing out of self-preservation can only be justified by utmost necessity, which is why harm must by imminent
    * Harm here was not imminent. There was no immediate danger that could not be guarded against by any other way (e.g. through summoning protection of the law). Victim was sleeping and had been for some time. D had opportunity to resort to other means
    * Subjective belief of what is inevitable at some indefinite point in time is not "imminent". Even more, it hadn't be established that whatever victim might have done to D in the future (based on history of abuse) would have constituted the level of serious bodily harm necessary to justify using deadly force
      * Too much speculation here to warrant self-defense instruction based on evidence
* Dissent:
  * For the battered wife, there is no escape from the abuse. The next attack from the abuser could be the fatal one and thus, the abused wife is in constant fear of imminent death
  * The relevant question was whether belief in the impending nature of the threat, given the circumstances as Norman viewed them, was reasonable in the mind of a reasonable person
* Notes: 30 something states recognized gender-neutral "battered" defense

### *State v. Abbott* (1961)

* Facts: D got into a fist fight with V1 over a dispute involving a driveway D shared with V's family. V2 and V3 then came after D with a hatchet and carving knife/large fork. The parties’ accounts of what happened differed, but each of the Vs was ultimately hit by the hatchet. D was indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon each of the Vs. A jury acquitted D of charges related to V2 and V3, but found him guilty of the charge related to V1. D appealed
* Rule: **An individual has a duty to retreat before using deadly force to defend himself only to the point that he knows that he may retreat with complete safety**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed because the trial court’s instructions on retreat were ambiguous and confusing
  * The issue of whether an individual must retreat only arises if the defendant resorts to the use of deadly force to defend himself
    * MPC instructs that the use of deadly force is not justifiable if the actor knows he can avoid the use of such force by retreating with complete safety
  * If the individual does not use deadly force to defend himself, he may stand his ground regardless of the force used by an aggressor
  * Thus, jury should have been instructed to determine two issues:
    1. Did D intend to use deadly force himself? If not, he had every right to stand his ground using non-deadly force
    1. If so, did D know the opportunity to retreat with complete safety was present during the altercation?
* Notes:
  * Duty to retreat when faced with an aggressor before using deadly force to defend himself has historically divided the courts
    * Advocates of the no-retreat rule argue that an individual must hold one’s ground. They argue that the law should not require something that resembles cowardice ("true man doctrine")
    * Proponents of the retreat rule claim it is better that an assailed individual flee instead of unnecessarily taking a life
    * The MPC embraces the retreat rule while acknowledging that most courts oppose it
  * Traditional common law rule imposed a strict duty to retreat, allowing use of deadly force in self-defense only if every opportunity to flee had been exhausted ("had back against the wall" concept). Over time, majority of states adopted no-retreat or "true man" rule
    * However, it is a bit more complex than that. Some states still retain require retreat when confrontation occurs outside the home while several others treat possibility of retreat as a factor
    * States that still retain the retreat rule will make **exception to requirement of retreating where it is dangerous to do so**
  * **Stand your ground statutes**:
    * 33 states enacted laws permitting force to be met by force, including deadly force, even in public spaces where retreat is possible. While this enables those who are truly innocent to protect themselves and potentially save lives, there is also the issue of unintended consequences: more unnecessary killings may result and mistakes can be made on unfounded suspicion (including that which is racially influenced)
  * **Castle exception**
    * Even where retreat rule is still enforced, jurisdictions invariably make exception for using deadly force in home invasions
      * Not as clear in cases within the home where confrontation is between homeowner and guests or even co-occupants

### *United States v. Peterson* (1973 DC)

* Facts: V attempts to steal windshield wipers from D's store. D and V argue and D retreat's to store to get gun. When he returns outside, V is in car and prepared to drive away. D threatens to shoot and kill him, at which point V gets out of the car wielding a wrench. D warns V not to come any further. V continued moving towards D so he shoots and kills him. Instructions to jury included: self-defense generally not recognized if D provokes (though words are not enough), however it is if D withdraws from the conflict in good faith and let V know through words or actions. Also, there is no strict duty to retreat, but it is factor to be considered in determining necessity. D is convicted of manslaughter and appeals, challenging the jury instructions
* Rules:
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict may not invoke the doctrine of self-defense to justify killing his adversary, unless he withdrew from the conflict in good faith and communicated his withdrawal by words or acts**
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict is under a duty to retreat, if he may do so safely, before using deadly force in self-defense**
* Holding - Verdict is affirmed; jury was properly instructed
  * Court affirms instruction that self-defense not available to the aggressor, a rule that is based on the doctrine of necessity
    * Deadly force is only justified if there is no alternative. A person must honestly and reasonably believe that there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury
    * Person who provokes conflict does not have right to exercise deadly force. However, this right is restored if aggressor withdraws and communicates this to the victim
    * Since grabbing the gun made D the initial aggressor, jury instruction was correct. Jury would then need to decide if he properly withdrew or else self-defense would not be justified
  * Court affirms instruction that jury consider whether there was opportunity to safely retreat (quite obvious that there was)
    * DC still follows retreat rule; there is duty to avoid use of deadly force by retreating unless it would be dangerous to do so
    * Castle doctrine does not apply to initial aggressors, thus this would not remove him from the retreat rule despite this confrontation occurring on his own property
* Notes:
  * Some states will also allow initial aggressor to regain right to self-defense if they are faced with an excessive life-threatening respond
  * *Allen v. State* (1994 OK)
    * Facts: D fighting with partner and as partner leaving the partner hits D in the face. D pursues partner in car and parked to ask partner to reconsider. Partner came towards D with rake and D shot partner
    * Holding - D who initiates a confrontation, even without intention of killing, loses the right of self-defense
  * MPC slightly deviates from common law rule found in both *Allen* and *Peterson*. MPC provides narrower forfeiture of self-defense rights - only if one provokes with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm
    * Example: A attacks B with fists and B defends himself. B manages to subdue A by pinning him to the floor and begins to violently slam his head into the ground. A, who now fears for his life, manages to escape B's hold. B charges at him again and he pulls out a knife, fatally stabbing B
      * Under MPC, A would only lose his right to self defense if he intended to kill/seriously harm B when initiating the conflict. Starting a mere fist fight does not express such intent. Since this fist fight doesn't satisfy subsection (1) either, B is also not justified in using deadly force in response, but can only defend himself using moderate, non-deadly force. Once B begins slamming A's head into the ground, he clearly exceeds the boundaries of moderate force. At this point, A would be justified in using deadly force under subsection (1), but only if he believes

## Justification - Defense of Property

### *People v. Ceballos* (1974 CA)

* Facts - D set up spring gun in garage after noticing evidence that someone had attempted to forcibly enter. One night two teenage boys try to enter the garage, and one of the boys is shot in the face. D found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon. D contends use of the spring gun was lawful since it would have been lawful to exercise deadly force had he been present that time of the attempted burglary - he has right to do indirectly what he can do directly
* An individual may be held criminally or civilly liable if he sets upon his premises a deadly mechanical device which injures or kills another person
* Holding - Conviction is upheld
  * Regardless of tort liability in this area, the direct/indirect argument is not workable in this context. Person has control and discretion over the exercise of deadly force when physically present. Not the case with a spring gun; it poses significant safety risks to children, firefights, etc. Thus, liability depends on fortuitous results and imperils the lives of innocent people
  * Even if the direct/indirect argument was recognized as valid, D wouldn't have been justified in using deadly force even if he were there
    * MPC appears to permit use of deadly force when resisting attempt of a felony or in defense of property against one who manifestly intends, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony
    * However, literal interpretation is undesirable here since the categorization of "felony" has been expanded to include a very wide number of crimes, many of which are essentially non-violent. Case law has narrowed the interpretation of this language to mean atrocious crimes committed by force. This also applies to the "surprise or violence" language
    * **Where the character and manner of the burglary do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for exaction of human life or use of deadly force**
  * Here, two unarmed teenagers did not present such a threat. D's belief that burglary could present such a threat, which lead him to install the trap gun, is both unfounded and does not shield him from liability
* Notes
  * MPC limits use of deadly force, but will nonetheless permit it when the use of non-deadly force to prevent commission of the crime would expose the individual to substantial danger of serious harm
  * Some states have passed statutes expanding the use of deadly force in the home
    * CA Home Protection Bill of Rights - Reasonable fear of imminent serious harm is presumed by owner using deadly force when intruder does and is known to have unlawfully and forcibly entered the home
    * Colorado "Make-My-Day" law - Can use any level of force when non-occupant has made unlawful entry onto the property and there is reasonable belief that he intends to commit a crime
    * FL "stand your ground" - Whenever intruder forcibly enters car or dwelling, reasonable imminent fear is presumed if intruder was in process of unlawful entry and the person threatened knew or had reason to believe forcible/unlawful entry was occurring

### *Syndor v. State* (2001 MD)

* Facts: D approached at gunpoint to give up property and is assaulted. While being robbed, friends intervene and disarm robber. Robber attempts to flee but D shoots and kills him. Judge instructed trial jury that D was required to retreat/stand-down unless at the moment shots were fired, D was being robbed. D argues the attempt to flee was part of one continuous transaction
* Holding: Jury instructions were appropriate
  * CoA rejected D's argument. It acknowledged that for purpose of felony murder, robbery is not complete until the suspect escapes. However, that doesn't effect rule limiting deadly force
    * Court says relevant issue is not whether criminal enterprise is still in operation, **but whether the force then and there was necessary to avoid imminent danger of serious harm**
    * It was clear that no such threat of harm was posed by robber while attempting to flee unarmed, thus force was excessive

## Justification - Use of Force in Law Enforcement

* General principle is the same as it as for civilians: force must never be excessive in relation to the harm it seeks to prevent
  * However, law enforcement is different because it is not their duty to avoid danger, but to intervene. Much more dangerous work environment and carry firearms
  * Tension between ability to defuse conflict and prevent trouble by force or threat of force and the capacity to inflict unwarranted or unintended injury which may undermine community bonds and flare racial tensions
* Problem: Reasonable belief that a suspect poses serious threat may be informed by social, cultural, and racial presuppositions
  * 21 times as many African-Americans are shot by police than are whites
* When is it acceptable to use deadly force?
  * Not permissible to prevent misdemeanor or effectuate arrest for one - can't shoot suspect of misdemeanor who flees without resisting
    * However, as a general principle, **if suspect's flight poses threat of death or great harm to the public**, use of force may be justified (See *Scott v. Harris*, *Plumhoff v. Rickard*)
    * Additionally, if suspect of misdemeanor resists, general rule is that **officer may meet force with force**, and if threatened with deadly force, they may respond in kind because such response is needed to protect officer from threat of serious harm or death
  * Used to allow deadly force to prevent or make felony arrest. However as definition of felony expanded, courts restricted deadly force to situations involving **forcible and atrocious crime**
    * Such conduct includes use or threat of deadly force, thus substantial risk that failure to immediately apprehend will lead to such harm and thus police are justified in using deadly force to prevent it
    * Use of deadly force to apprehend suspect of felony like burglary has been found to be an "unreasonable" seizure in violation of 4A and thus unconstitutional (See *Tennessee v. Garner*)
      * Constitutional standard is similar to MPC. In order **to justify use of deadly force to prevent felon's escape, it must be necessary measure taken where probable cause exists as to the belief that suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officers or others**
    * Use of taser is generally not considered deadly force

## Justification - Necessity Defense ("Choice of Evils")

* Necessity = Defense that otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable as it was necessary to avoid more serious harm
* MPC 3.02
  * (1) D’s otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable if:
    * D sought to avoid harm greater than the harm resulting from D’s conduct
      * Does not rely on the private judgement of D. **The harm/evil sought to be avoided must actually be greater than that from the commission of the offense, regardless of D's belief**
      * Not enough that actor beliefs conduct is sufficient to ameliorate the harm. **Must believe it was necessary to avoid the evils**
    * Statute does not explicitly preclude necessity defense
    * No obvious legislative purpose or policy reason to deny necessity defense
  * (2) Necessity NOT a defense if situation brought about by D’s reckless or negligent conduct
* CL Self-Defense (see *Unger*)
  * (1) No blame in developing the situation AND
  * (2) D reasonably believed engaging in conduct was necessary to avoid a harm greater than a resulting harm which might result from the conduct (see *Hutchins*) AND
  * (3) (split jurisdiction) Satisfying credibility factors is:
    * Required - D must notify law enforcement as soon as the threat ends (see Bailey, Unger)
    * Not Required - D does not need to notify law enforcement, factors considered holistically
  
### *People v. Unger* (1977 IL)

* Facts:  D (inmate) at minimum security prison sexually assaulted and threatened with rape. Gets anonymous phone call threating to kill him because caller (falsely) heard the D had reported it to prison authorities. D leaves the facilities and is apprehended days later several miles away
* Rule: **Justifiable by reason of necessity if the defendant was without blame in developing the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than the injury which might result from his own conduct**
* Reasoning:
  * In *Harmon*, defense of duress was held to apply in case where D alleged that he escaped to avoided repeated homosexual attacks from fellow inmates. Courts had reached similar results in escape cases involving sexual abuse under the theory of necessity
  * Court says necessity is the appropriate defense here - D was not deprived of free will by threat of harm (i.e. duress). Rather, he was **forced to chose between two imminent evils**, as supported by his testimony
  * Factors considered to determine reasonableness of necessity defense include: The threat and imminence of the threat; Opportunity to complain or seek protection through courts/law; No violence employed in the escape; and immediately reports to authorities once reaches position of safety from the threat
    * Must not satisfy all of these to assert necessity defense as matter of law, but relevant consideration
  * Under circumstances, D was entitled to jury instructions for necessity defense - he had no part in developing the situation (i.e. threats against him) and injury avoided by escaping is more harmful than the escape
* Dissent - Allowing this defense will create trouble in the future and may encourage undesirable conduct

### *United States v. Schoon* (1992 9th Cir.)

* Facts: Group of Ds gained access to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office in AZ where they protested the policy between US and El Salvador. Chanted, splashed fake blood, and generally obstructed the office’s operation. After repeated warnings to leave or face arrest by a federal police officer, group was arrested after refusing to comply. At trial, Ds proffered testimony about conditions in El Salvador as motivations for their conduct and argued that their actions were necessary to avoid further bloodshed. Judge rejected "necessity" defense and Ds were convicted
* Issue: Is the necessity defense available in indirect civil disobedience cases?
* Rule: **The necessity defense requires a defendant to show that he was faced with a choice between two related evils, that he acted to prevent imminent harm, and there was no legal alternative to violating the law. It is unavailable in indirect civil disobedience cases**
* Holding - Court holds that necessity defense was properly rejected in the trial court
  * To properly invoke the necessity defense, the defendants must have shown that (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law
  * "Civil disobedience" is the willful violation of a law, undertaken for the purpose of social or political protest. Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law or interfering with a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest
  * The mere existence of a constitutional law or governmental policy cannot constitute a legally cognizable harm. Thus, no greater harm to avert. Court must also take into consideration the likelihood that an alleged harm will be abated by the criminal action. Here, the protest alone is unlikely to change the policy towards El Salvador precisely because the act is indirect. Finally, possibility that congress could change its mind is sufficient to make lawful political action a reasonable alternative to the unlawful conduct

### *Regina v. Dudley and Stephens* (1884 UK)

* Facts: Defendants were on the crew of an English yacht. Ship wrecks and become stranded at sea for 24 days. After week without food, they kill one of the weaker crew members and fed off his body until a passing ship rescued them. Ds tried for murder of the crew member. Trial jury determined Ds would not have survived long enough to be rescued had they not done what they did. They also determined that the member that was killed also would not have survived. Ultimately unable to reach verdict
* Issue: Will the defense of necessity justify a homicide committed to save the defendants' own lives?
* Rule: **The intentional killing of another is murder unless there is some legal justification (e.g. self-defense)**
* Holding: Defendants found guilty of murder and sentenced to death (later commuted to 6 months)
  * Necessity is only a justification for murder when the killing is committed in self-defense. Thus, the defense of necessity may not be used to justify the killing of an innocent bystander.There is no authority supporting the principle that one may take the life of an innocent person to save his own
* Notes:
  * MPC Commentaries appears to endorse utilitarian approach to the "two-evils" problem. Numerical calculus to justify the intentional killing of an innocent person in order to save lives, which is lesser evil than the death of several others. This is a real life trolley problem. Direct tension between rights and maximizing lives

### *Public Committee Against Torture v. Israel* (1999 Israeli Supreme Court)

* Facts: Israeli government (D) authorized one if its national security agencies to employ physical means against those undergoing interrogation. Included sleep deprivation, shaking, forcing subjects to stay in painful positions for long amounts of time. Agency was instructed to consider urgency/severity of potential attacks and to seek alternative measures if possible. Agency argued these methods help thwart imminent terrorist attacks
* Issue: Were torture methods acceptable under the defense of "necessity" as codified in Penal Law Article 34(1), which states, "A person will not bear criminal liability for committing any act immediately necessary for the purpose of saving the life, liberty, body or property, of either himself or his fellow person, from substantial danger of serious harm, imminent from the particular circumstances, at the requisite time, and absent alternative means for avoiding the harm"?
* Holding: Methods of torture are categorically prohibited and thus unauthorized for use even under necessity exception
  * The interrogation of a suspect must "absolutely" be free of torture, free of cruel and inhuman treatment, and free of dignity-taking methods. Methods employed by the agency violated the subjects' dignity
  * While necessity exception would definitely arise in "ticking time bomb situation" where physical methods used to obtain information about imminent attack and spare innocent lives. However, question is whether the use of such physical means were authorized. The order prohibiting physical means of interrogation is made absolute and can't be justified by necessity

## Justification - Euthanasia

### *Crusan v. Missouri Dept. of Health* (1989)

* Facts - P in vegetative state following car accident and, with no chance of recovery, family requested she be removed from life support. Some evidence from past conversation P would want life support withdrawn. The hospital refused to do so without a court order. The trial court granted P's parents petition to remove the tube. Missouri Supreme Court reversed and held that the evidence of P's desire not to continue life-prolonging treatment was not clear and convincing and thus P's parents lacked the authority to effectuate the court order
* Is Missouri's evidentiary standard for establishing intent to withdraw treatment constitutionally valid?
* Holding - State evidentiary standard is valid and upheld
  * An incompetent person is not able to make informed and rational choice here. Any such right must be exercised by a surrogate
  * Here, Missouri allows surrogate to act for patient in deciding to withdraw life support
  * However, Missouri employs a procedural safeguard by requiring the  decision conform as closely to the incapacitated person's wishes as closely as possible. Thus it requires clear and convincing evidence as to the wishes of the incapacitated person
    * This procedural requirement relies on State's interest in preserving and protecting human life. There is no denying this is a valid state interest

### *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997)

* Facts: Under Washington state law, it is a crime to knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide. P, a physician, brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that the Washington state law violated a liberty interest protected by 14A. District court found that it did and CoA affirmed.
* Rule: The right to physician-assisted suicide is not a constitutionally-protected liberty interest under the 14A DPC, though jurisdictions may allow it
* Holding: Washington law banning P.A.S. is constitutional
  * Bans on P.A.S. represent those states’ commitment to the protection and preservation of all human life, a legitimate interest
  * Right to P.A.S. is not a fundamental right under the DPC - the Nation’s history and tradition has almost uniformly rejected the existence of the right, and most states continue to explicitly reject it in the present day
  * The right to P.A.S. is distinguishable from the right of competent persons to remove unwanted life-sustaining treatment recognized in *Cruzan*: the right to be free from unwanted medical procedures, at issue in *Cruzan*, is long established in national traditions upholding bodily integrity and protecting against battery, even by physicians
  * Thus, Washington legislature acted rationally in banning assisted suicide in furtherance of these legitimate objectives

## Excuse - In General

* Unlike justification, which asserts that what the excused did was appropriate or utility-maximizing, **excuse seeks to show that although the acts were harmful, they could not have been expected to do otherwise**

* We can thus characterize excuse as a defense the law allows to a wrongful action because the actor has displayed some disability or deprivation in capacity to know or choose, which renders the person either free of blame or subject to less blame
  * The disabilities that ground excuse in our law seem to fall into one of three groups:
    * Those disabilities that produce involuntary actions
      * As discussed in actus reus section, involuntary action not viewed as a culpable act at all (i.e. nothing to excuse)
    * Those that produce deficient but reasonable actions
      * There is a power to choose in a literal sense, but the choice is constrained either due to cognitive deficiency (e.g. mistake) or a volitional one (e.g. duress)
    * Those that render all actions irresponsible
      * This person could not act otherwise because they were simply not responsible moral agents at the time (e.g. insanity, infancy)

* Three most important forms of excuse: duress, intoxication, and mental disorder

## Excuse - Duress

* Duress = affirmative defense that D coerced into criminal conduct b/c (see Toscano, Contreras-Pinchon)

* MPC §2.09 – Duress
  * (1) Defense if coerced to do so by unlawful force or threat against him or another to which a person of reasonable firmness in the actor’s situation would be unable to resist
    * Threat does not necessarily have to be against the actor; could be against a relative. However, language here omits property
  * (2) Unavailable for crimes of recklessness/ negligence if actor recklessly/negligently brought about the situation
  * Remarks:
    * Possible limitations on the defense **not** in MPC
      * Requirement of imminence
      * Disallow it for murder
      * Treat it as a mitigation factor, not a total defense

* As a defense to homicide (split jurisdiction)
  * CL: No defense to homicide
  * MPC: Available in cases of homicide
  
* CL Duress
  * (1) person made "specific and imminent" threats of "serious bodily injury or death" against D or D’s family member if should D refuse to commit a crime
    * NOTE: Some jurisdictions apply it to property too (if property value outweighs harm)
  * (2) D reasonably believed the other person would carry out the threat
  * (3) D had no reasonable opportunity to prevent the threatened harm by:
    * (a) Fleeing
    * (b) Informing law enforcement
  * (4) D did NOT recklessly or negligently expose himself to the threat
    * NOTE: this element often arises if D part of criminal enterprise where threats are reasonably expected
  * (5) Crime was not homicide

* Duress distinguished from Necessity in that:
  * (1) Duress is excuse (not right, but circumstances were such that reasonable law abider might have done so) while necessity is justification (under circumstances, D took the right course of action; to do so was the lesser evil)
  * (2) Duress always involves a human threat while necessity may or may not involve human threat (e.g. could be natural condition)
  * (3) Duress D’s free will impaired while necessity D’s free will intact
  * (4) Duress furthers evil while necessity intended to avoid a greater evil to general welfare

### *State v. Toscano* (1977 NJ)

* Facts: Defendant was charged with conspiring to obtain money on false pretenses from insurance company. He agreed to do so because he owed money to a guy for gambling debts. The guy made vague threats against him and his wife. Said he filed because of fear of his life
* Rule: **Duress is defense to a crime (other than murder) if the defendant committed the crime:**
  * **(1) Because he was coerced to do so by threat or use of force**
  * **(2) Which a person or reasonable firmness in his position would have been unable to resist**
* Holding - Conviction reversed and matter remanded
  * At common law duress was recognized only when involving a use or threat of harm which is "present, imminent, and pending," and "of such a nature as to induce a well grounded  apprehension of death or serious bodily harm is the act is not done" in a man of ordinary fortitude
  * Drafters of the MPC focused on whether the standard imposed upon the accused was one with which normal members of the community will be able to comply
  * Thus under both MPC and New Jersey Penal Code, D should have had question of duress submitted to jury since his testimony that the act was committed out of fear was a factual basis for finding of duress if it could be determined that a person of reasonable firmness would have done so
* Notes:
  * Inquiry here would focus on the weaknesses and strengths of a particular defendant and his subjective reaction to unlawful demands
  * Taking into account expectations based on the defendant’s character and situation makes this approach more subjective than the reasonable person standard at common law
  * Imminence of the threat:
    * Both *Toscano* and the Model Penal Code treat the imminence of the threatened harm as one factor to be weighed by the jury in determining whether the defendant’s conduct was that of a person of reasonable firmness in his situation
    * Many common law decisions treated imminence as an absolute pre-requisite to the availability of a duress defense and some statutes expressly limited the defense to situations involving threats of instant death
    * Great majority of the recent statutory revisions have rejected the Model Penal Code’s flexible approach and preserved some requirement that the threatened harm be immediate and imminent, or instant

### *United States v. Fleming* (1957)

* Facts: POW was told to create propaganda to promote dissatisfaction among troops or be forced to march to some far away camp in the winter. Charged with aiding the enemy
* Holding: Court affirms conviction
  * Duress not available; D cooperated on mere threats of the march
  * Other soldiers had refused in similar situations, thus it doesn’t meet prong 2 (persons of reasonable firmness had resisted)
* Notes:
  * Potentially problematic application of the standard: instead of ordinary reasonable person in his situation, they seem to be using a much higher standard for soldiers
    * Would require everyone to be like John McCain

*Contreras-Pinchon* (1984 9th Cir.)

* Facts: Taxi driver from Columbia made to swallow balloons of cocaine and travel to America. He and his family were threatened in Colombia. D claimed he only did so because someone threatened to kill him and his family if he didn’t transport the drugs
* Rule: **Threat must be immediate, act must be grounded on fear of threat being realized, and there must be no reasonable opportunity for escape**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed
  * Duress is allowed because threats were serious (dealing with Colombian drug lords) and there was little rescue in Colombia (police are corrupt)
    * D was constrained by belief that police help was futile. Should be up to jury to determine whether the belief renders police help an unreasonable means of escape
* Dissent:
  * Failed to present evidence to support elements of inescapability
    * Illustrates problems for prosecutor – how can they disprove this beyond a reasonable doubt if burden is on them?

## Excuse - Intoxication

* MPC §2.08 - Intoxication
  * (1) except as in (4), intoxication not a defense unless it negatives an element of the offense
  * (2) when recklessness is mens rea, if intoxication causes actor to not be aware of a risk he would have been sober, intoxication not a defense
  * (3) intoxication not a mental disease within 4.01
  * (4) intoxication that is either (a) no self-induced or (b) pathological is a defense if by reason of intoxication the actor lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness/ criminality or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law
    * “Pathological” means intoxication much more than actor expected given the amount of the intoxicant
  * Remarks:

* Common Law - Voluntary Intoxication
  * In some jurisdictions, is not recognized at all
  * However, more common for intoxication to be relevant for determining a specific intent, but not a general intent
    * Specific intent – crime includes that actor desired some additional consequence or do some further act (e.g. assault with intent to rob)
      * You did not act with the required intent, such as, if your actions had been part of a harmless prank, then you cannot be convicted of a specific crime
      * When it does negate specific intent, you have to be more than just “disinhibited”
    * General intent – only intent in crime is with respect to the immediate act; you only need to intend your actions, not any particular result
      * Is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that you intend to cause a specific harm or end result. Must only show that intended to commit some act that the law prohibits
  * Also jurisdictions where defense only to reduce murder charge (PA statute)

* Common Law Involuntary Intoxication
  * D took substance (i) without knowledge of its intoxicating nature, (ii) under duress, or (iii) based on medical advice but unaware of intoxicating effect
    * Availability of defense (split jurisdiction):
      * (1) Treated as mental illness defense (depends on jurisdiction definition)
      * (2) Defense for culpability
      * (3) No defense for culpability (*Kingston*)

### *People v. Hood* (CA 1969)

* Facts: Heavily drunken man was resisting arrest. Grab the officers gun and shot him in the leg. Is convicted of assault with deadly weapon
* Rule: **In crimes of general intent evidence of the accused’s intoxication shall not be considered in determining guilt or innocence**
* Holding: Jury improperly instructed to consider intoxication
  * Evidence of intoxication should not relieve one of blame for simple assault or assault with a deadly weapon, crimes which frequently are committed rashly or in anger
  * In both CA and NY assault with a deadly weapon is a general intent crime

### Roberts v. People

* Facts: Man shoots another while drunk, charged with attempted murder.Allowed to include intoxication evidence to negate mens rea
* Holding:
  * **If renders him incapable of knowing what he was doing (required intent) -> not guilty**
  * If he did have the intent prior to intoxication, subsequent drunkenness is not a defense -> still responsible
  * Likewise, if held to have purposely blinded his moral perceptions and committed act intentionally without knowing it was wrong -> then still guilty

### *State v. Stasio* (NJ 1979)

* Facts: Defendant was charged with assault with attempt to rob (specific intent crime). Asserts intoxication as a defense
* Holding: NJ choses to go in a different direction -> **no admissibility of intoxication regardless of specific or general intent**, except to demonstrate premeditation and deliberation
  * Court doesn't want intoxication to be considered in a specific intent crime either because:
    * Leads to inconsistent results
    * General intent v specific intent distinction is just a guide for admitting intoxication evidence
* Dissent: an intoxicated D can’t form the necessary specific intent, so shouldn’t be held to same standard as others
* Note: States are completely non-uniform on their application of intoxication defense

### *Montana v. Egelhoff* (1996)

* Facts: D intoxicated and found with friends killed in a car. D claimed too intoxicated to remember. Montana statute for deliberate homicide required “purposely” or “knowingly” but did not allow for intoxication defense. Montana Supreme court held it unconstitutional. SCOTUS reversed (5-4, Ginsburg concurrence was the deciding vote)
* Majority (Scalia): While DPC gives right to present relevant evidence, that right is not absolute. All evidentiary rulings can have the effect of reducing the evidentiary burden of the state; doesn’t violate the principle of fairness so its not unconstitutional
  * Refusing to allow a defense of voluntary intoxication deters drunkenness, ensures people who commit crimes while intoxicated go to prison, and fits with society’s moral determination that voluntary intoxication does not excuse criminal conduct
  * Evidence of voluntary intoxication could mislead a jury

### *Regina v. Kingston* (1994 UK)

* Facts: D lures a 15-year-old boy to D's flat and then invited the defendant over to abuse the boy sexually. Person blackmailing D drugged him, then videotaped the incident to use in extortion
* Rule: **Involuntary intoxication does not negate the mens rea necessary from criminal liability**
* Holding:
  * Equates the desire with intent -> When he was engaged in the conduct he knew the boy was underage; he was not in an unconscious state but just disinhibited
    * The essential evil mental state exists; the drug only allows it to be acted upon
  * To recognize this as a complete defense would make assessing guilt in any manner involving intoxication exceedingly complex and raise a host of evidentiary problems
    * Preferable approach to involuntary intoxication is to continue to use the concept of diminished capacity, rather than create a complete defense
    * Only exception if intoxicated to the extent as to be considered insane

## Excuse - Insanity

* **Insanity** - A defense negating mens rea or affirmative defense that D committed criminal act while suffering a legally recognized abnormal mental condition
  * Two types of behavior insanity covers
    * Cognitive defect – D didn’t understand the significance of his actions
    * Behavioral defect – D couldn’t control himself
  * *Ford v. Wainwright*: Supreme Court declares that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of the insane. Court stated that the defendant must have a rational understanding rather than mere awareness of the nexus between his crime and the punishment
  * *Atkins v. Virginia*: Eighth Amendment forbids execution of people with mental retardation

* Important terms:
  * Mental Illness - Medical term referring to D’s diagnosed mental disorder, which ranges in severity and type (personality, psychotic, depression, etc)
  * Insanity - Legal term referring to D’s mental state at time of the crime that may preclude culpability
  * Incompetence - Legal term referring to D’s mental state at time of legal proceedings preventing “rational” and “factual” understanding of the proceedings against him, which may preclude ability to stand trial, undertake a responsibility, or get executed (including mentally disabled)
    * **MPC §4.04** - Competence to be Tried and Sentence: No person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures
    * **Dusky Test**: “The test must be whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding – and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.”
    * Note: Mental Illness broader than Insanity and Incompetence, so D can have mental illness and NOT be considered insane or incompetent
    * Note: D could get Insanity but not Incompetent, or vice versa

* Procedural impacts of the insanity defense
  * May not be competent to stand trial
  * Normally can’t sentence to death

* Insanity can arise at three points in the criminal process
  * (1) Mental state at the time of the commission of the criminal offense
  * (2) Incompetence to stand trial -> lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings or to assist in his own defense
  * (3) Sentencing -> can not execute the criminally insane

* Approaches for after acquittal
  * (1) Civil Commitment
    * (a) Some jurisdictions require civil commitment; others have make ad-hoc determinations -> juries in the verdict are not to be made aware of whether it is mandatory or not
    * (b) Duration -> may be released when the patient has recovered and is not longer dangerous
  * (2) Guilty but mentally ill -> court retains the same sentencing authority as in guilty verdicts, but if sentenced to prison he is to be given treatment for the illness

* Burden of Proof
  * (1) There is a presumption of legal sanity at the trial
  * (2) Level of evidence required before the presumption disappears
    * (a) Some states require only “some evidence” of legal insanity
    * (b) Others require that the evidence raise a reasonable doubt about the sanity
  * (3) Most States and the federal system require to the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is insane. 

### Different Rules and Formulations of Insanity

* Empirically speaking, formulations shown to not make much of a difference
* Should the formulation be medical or moral?
  * Criminal law about social approbation, so  latter makes more sense – also shouldn’t hinge on changing defs of medical profession
  * If it’s moral, doesn’t a phase of the trial dominated by psychiatrists just muck everything up?

* **M’Naghten Rule** - "[D acted] under such a defect of reason so as to not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, he did not know what he was doing was wrong". Regarded as most restrictive standard
  * In order to meet the burden, must show:
    * Mental disease of defect
    * Causation
    * Lacked knowledge of
      * The nature of quality of the act
      * OR the wrongness of the act (legally/morally)
  * Rudovsky example: D (Vietnam veteran) has PTSD and shoots at fireman who come to his house; D fails *M’Naghten* because knew the “wrongfulness” of shooting and “nature and quality” of shooting
  * A little under half of all jurisdictions still employ some rule similar to this

* **MPC §4.01** - ~40% of jurisdictions have adopted this instead, a more permissive test regarding insanity
  * D meets defense burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease or defect (severity and type ambiguous, though excludes abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal/anti-social conduct)
    * (2) D lacked “substantial capacity” at time of crime to either:
      * (a) Appreciate his conduct’s criminality (i.e. M’Naghten “wrongfulness” prong; but MPC leave open to moral or legal wrongfulness) OR
      * (b) Conform his conduct to the law’s requirements (i.e. volitional prong)
  * Distinguished from M'Naghten:
    * Loosens cognitive impairment (needs to appreciate right/wrong, not just know the difference)
    * Loosens volitional impairment (lack substantial capacity to conform his conduct to requirements of the law)
    * Began to fall out of favor after *Hinckley*

* **Durham Test** - First standard to question M’Naghten, but considered too broad
  * D meets burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease (NOTE: severity and type is ambiguous)
    * (2) Caused a defect of reason
    * (3) D’s crime would not have been committed but-for the abnormal mental condition (this is very broad; nothing related to knowledge of wrongfulness or the act itself)
  
* **Irresistible Impulse Test** - Question of impaired volitional ability, less restrictive than M’Naghten
  * D meets defense burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease
    * (2) Caused a defect of reason
    * (3) D unable to control his actions and follow the law

### *M'Naghten* (1843 UK)

* Facts: Defendant suffered delusions and killed a secretary to the Prime Minister. There was considerable evidence that the defendant was insane
* Question: What is the proper instruction for the jury in a case where the insanity defense is used?
* Rule: **It must be proven that at the time of the act, the accused was under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing; or if he did know, he did not know what he was doing was wrong**
* Holding: Jurors should be instructed that every man is presumed sane and to posses a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes. Therefore, in order to establish an insanity defense, it must be clearly proven that at the time of the act, the accused as under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing; or if he did know, he did not know what he was doing was wrong
* Notes Case - The King v. Porter
  * The court instructed the jury that the first thing they must do is only focus on the condition of mind at the time the act complained of was done. The next thing the jury must do is determine if the defendant’s state of mind was one of disease, disturbance, disorder. Then. Then the jury must decide that if the defendant’s state of mind was that of disease, they must decide if it was such a character to prevent him from knowing the physical nature of the act he was doing or of knowing that what he was doing was wrong

### *Blake V United States* (1969 5th Circuit)

* Background - Case where court Adopts the MPC test for insanity
* Facts: Defendant was charged with robbery. He told people he was about to rob the bank and had a history of mental illness and electro-shock therapy. The evidence overwhelmingly proved his guilt, but he offered the defense of insanity. He was convicted, but appealed by stating that the insanity definition he was convicted on did not meet the standard for was outdated. Defendant had a history of violence and erratic behavior and may have been suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the robbery. The court instructed the jury that the defendant was insane if he completely lacks capacity to know right from wrong. The jury convicted and the defendant appealed.
* Question: Was the jury instruction on insanity correct?
* Holding: No, the original insanity charge to the jury was “the term insanity as used in this defense means such a perverted and deranged condition of the mental and moral faculties as to render a person incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, or unconscious at the time of the nature of the act he is committing, or where, though conscious of it and able to distinguish between right and wrong and know the act is wrong, yet his will, by which I mean the governing power of his mind has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are to subject to it but are beyond his control.” By contrast, the MPC test for insanity which the defendant urged the court to adopt states, “A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.” The MPC definition is slightly less rigid in that lack of capacity must be substantial rather complete. This is the better formula according to the court, so the conviction was overturned.

### *United States V Lyons* (1984 5th Cir.)

* Background: Court rejects MPC requirement, reasoning that it allows too many people to plead insanity
* Facts: Lyon was convicted of twelve counts of knowingly and intentionally securing controlled narcotics. During trial, Lyons claimed his drug addiction was a mental disease within the definition proscribed in the insanity defense. He offered evidence that in 1978 he became addicted to several prescription drugs given to him for pain relief. In addition, Lyons sought to present expert witnesses who would testify that has drug addiction changed the physiology and psychology of his brain resulting an incapacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The trial court, however, excluded the proffered evidence.
* Question: Does the existing insanity defense standard of a “lack of capacity to conform one’s conduct to the requirements of the law” coincide with current medical and scientific knowledge?
* Holding: No, although addiction is not a mental disease, the addiction itself may cause actual physical damage to the brain resulting in a mental disease or defect in the brain. Defendant rightfully sought to offer such evidence to the jury. Although the court no longer recognizes the volitional prong under the insanity defense, defendant should be afforded the opportunity to offer such evidence in an attempt to satisfy the cognitive prong. A defendant in a criminal case is not guilty by reason of insanity if at the time of the conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he us unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.
* Dissent: An adjudication of guilt is not only a factual determination but a moral judgment that an individual is to blame. The court’s decision rests on its desire to redefine insanity and narrow the defense on policy considerations. Pleas of insanity and are rarely successful and do not go to trial
* Notes:
  * After the Hinckley case (guy who tried to assassinate president Reagan), many courts got rid of the MPC insanity rule because it allowed too many people to plead insanity (Only 14 states still have MPC requirement)
  * It is generally unconstitutional for a state to try and abolish the insanity defense

### *State v. Crenshaw* (1983 WA)

* Facts: While the defendant and his wife were on their honeymoon in Canada, the defendant was deported to the US.
The defendant believed that his wife was unfaithful in the few days it took for her to meet up with him back in the
112
US. Defendant brutally murdered his wife because he believed that under his religious beliefs he had to kill her if
she committed adultery. The jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder. The defendant contended that
the trial court erred in defining “right and wrong” as legal and wrong rather than in a moral sense.
* Question: Did the trial court err in defining “right and wrong” as a legal right and wrong instead of the moral sense?
* Holding: It is society’s morals and not an individuals morals that are the standard for judging moral wrong under M’Naghten. If moral wrong were judged by an individual’s conscience, the criminal law would be seriously undermined because it would allow a person in violation of the law to be excused from criminal responsibility merely because in his own conscience, his act was not morally wrong. There is evidence on the record that the defendant knew his actions were wrong according to societies standards.
* Notes:
  * Defendants who act out of a deific decree will generally have an insanity defense, although this is hotly debated because many people find this is outdated

### *State v. Guido* (1963 New Jersey)

* Facts: The victim in this case was the defendant’s husband. Her husband was a professional fighter who married her at a young age. The defendant was intimidated by her husband and felt as though she were under a constant threat of injury. There was evidence of a few instances of actual injury. The victim had an extra-marital affair and as a result the defendant wanted a divorce. The defendant called the police on several occasions prior to the incident to express her fear of her husband. On the night in question, her husband was asleep on the couch and the defendant took a gun from the living room into the bedroom in order to commit suicide. Once in the bedroom she changed her mind and decided to put the gun away. When the defendant saw her husband lying on the couch she opened fire until there were no bullets left. Defense counsel hired expert witnesses in order to put together the insanity defense. The psychiatrists initial report stated that the defendant was legally sane at the time of the incident. After debate with defense counsel, the psychiatrist agreed to change their opinion as to the legal sanity issue. However, their underlying medical findings remained the same. The psychiatrist thought that only psychosis was what qualified as a disease of the mind.
* Question: What constitutes “a disease of the mind” under the concept of legal insanity?
* Holding: There is widespread reluctance to define what is meant by “disease” under the M’Naghten rule. Because there is no concrete definition, the definition of what constitutes legal insanity is up for discussion. In this case, the defendant emotional insanity met the definition of disease of the mind.
* Notes:
  * Courts define “disease of the mind” differently, some give a broad standard that includes many types of insanity (i.e. emotional) and others give more limited definitions
  * It must be a disease however, and this requirement has defeated insanity claims for battered woman syndrome, compulsive gambling disorder, postpartum disorders, alcohol and drug addictions, and others

### *Clark v. Arizona* (2006)

* Facts: During a traffic stop, defendant shot and killed a police officer, and was prosecuted for first-degree murder. Clark admitted the shooting but brought his paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident as a defense, to prove that he did not have the specific intent to shoot an officer of the law the knowledge that he was committing the specific crime. The trial court ruled that the defendant could not use evidence showing that he was insane to rebut the presence of mens rea. Thus psychiatric evidence could not be admitted to prove the absence of specific intent, or of mens rea, defendant was convicted. Defendant pleaded a violation of his due process of law
* Question: Does a state violate a due process of law by preventing the introduction of evidence showing diminished capacity by a criminal defendant?
* Holding: No, a state’s prohibition of the introduction of diminished mental capacity by the defendant in a criminal case does not violate due process. A defendant is presumed sane until he proves otherwise, but allowing a defendant to use evidence of insanity to show that he could not form the necessary criminal intent would enable him to get around that presumption. “Clark presses no objection to Arizona’s decision to require persuasion to clear and convincing degree before the presumption of sanity. And normal responsibility.” But if a state is to have authority in practice as well in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the presumption of sanity more easily when addressing a different issue in the course of the criminal trial
* Dissent: Defendant should be allowed to introduce evidence of his lack of awareness or intent to commit the specific crime he is charged with, provided it is reliable and thought-through, so that that he can prove he cannot be convicted of either knowingly or voluntarily killing a police officer. The final placing of the burden of proof on the defendant as to his intent or knowledge of the crime he was committing is unconstitutional as the state has the responsibility of proving these elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt
* Notes:
  * *United States v. Brawner*: Establishes the Brawner Approach, evidence about D’s mental condition at the time of the crime is admissible to negate a required specific intent but not a general intent
  * Many states impose no special restrictions on the use of mental-health evidence to rebut a required mens rea
    * 16 state bar evidence of mental illness to negate culpability elements of any kind, 13 states permit mental illness to negate only specific intent, and 23 jurisdictions allow mental-illness evidence to negate any element (this is the MPC Approach)
    * MPC Approach: Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense
    * The MPC approach permits the use of mental health evidence to rebut a required mens rea, but for cases when the elements of an offense are proved, the MPC rejects a statutory reduction of punishment for reduced mental capacity
