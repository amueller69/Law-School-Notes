# Introduction - What is Civil Procedure

## What is a Lawsuit

* A legal mechanism enabling someone whom believes they have been wronged to recover through court provided remedies.
* A series of burdens on an aggrieved individual in order to show that they are entitled to relief.
* A series of opportunities for a defendant to deny relief to the plaintiff on the grounds that they failed to satisfy these burdens.

## Distinction between Civil and Criminal Law

### Criminal Law

* Object of proceedings is punishment
* Governs rules of conduct imposed by state
* Enforced through state initiated prosecutions
* Governed by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
* State has burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt

### Civil Law

* Object of proceeding is remedy for injury in form of a judgement
* Defines rights and obligations people owe one another
* Enforced through privately initiated actions
* Governed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  * Rules with characteristics of "quasi-legislation" that guide civil actions in Federal courts
  * State procedural systems may vary in significant ways
* Less demanding burden of proof - a fair preponderance of the evidence

## Structure of Courts

### Federal Court System

* Considered to have *limited subject matter authority*
  * Can only hear cases if authorized to do so by federal statute and Article III of Constitution
* Three tiers
  1. Trial courts - Organized by district (*district courts*)
  1. Intermediate courts - Organized by circuit (*courts of appeal*)
  1. Supreme Court - Final appellate authority over:
     1. Cases brought in federal courts
     1. Cases brought in state courts raising questions governed by federal law

### State Court System

* Considered to have *plenary authority*
  * Able to hear cases involving subject matter not exclusively reserved for federal courts
* Structure of the court system varies by state
  * Typically a trial court, and intermediate court of appeals, and a supreme court

## Stages of a Lawsuit

### 1. Investigation

* Aggrieved party consults attorney. Attorney is obliged with determining whether claim has merit.

### 2. Fee Arrangements

* If claim is deemed to have merit, lawyer will make arrangement for payment of fee in exchange for representation.
* *American rule* is the dominant one in this country. Each side pays own attorney fees regardless of case outcome
* In many civil cases, a *contingent fee* is agreed to, in which a percent of recovery will be paid to attorney if successful.

### 3. Subject Matter Jurisdiction

* Determine which court has the authority to hear lawsuits of the type
* State courts are courts of general subject matter with small exceptions
* Federal courts are courts of limited subject matter. There are two bases:
  1. *Arising under* jurisdiction - Cause of action comes from violation of federal law, treaty, or the Constitution
  2. *Diversity* jurisdiction - Meets complete diversity requirement (opposing parties from different states and amount in question is > $75,000)
* For certain types of cases (e.g. securities, antitrust, patent, and trademark), federal courts are said to have exclusive jurisdiction.

### 4. Personal Jurisdiction

* Determining whether a court with authority over a specific geographic region has personal jurisdiction over the defendant

### 5. Service of Process

* Notifying the defendant of the commencement of the lawsuit, typically achieved through a *summons*

### 6. Pleadings

* Inform defendant of the claims at varying levels of detail based on the rules of a jurisdiction.
* The initial *complaint*, which often accompanies the summons, must at the very minimum lay out basic claims that show plaintiff is entitled to relief
* Defendant must respond through one several available actions including *dispositive motions* that will dismiss the case or an *answer* that either affirms the claims made in the complaint. A *counterclaim* can also be asserted.

### 7. Remedies

* Type of relief being sought. Can take the form of money damages or a court order to do or refrain from doing something

### 8. Pretrial Discovery

* Process of obtaining information from opposing party and witnesses. Occurs through a variety of mechanisms

### 9. Summary Judgement

* Either party can motion for a judgement prior to the commencement of the trial based on a lack of factual sufficiency of the opposing party's position

### 10. Trial

* If the case is not dismissed and a summary judgement isn't awarded, it will go to either a jury trial or a bench trial.
* Burden of persuasion -- convincing the judge/jury that a fair preponderance of evidence supports their position -- typically falls on the plaintiff.

### 11. Appeal

* Every legal system in the US provides for review of a trial court decision by an appellate court
* Appellate court decides case on **sole** basis of written record of trial proceedings
* Appellate court has power to affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the judgement

### 12. Enforcement of Judgements

* Judgements involving money damages often require enforcement proceedings to govern execution and assets involved

### 13. Finality

* Characteristic of all dispute-resolution mechanisms that prevents re-litigation of claims that have already been tried

# Intro to Jurisdiction

## Personal Jurisdiction

* **Personal Jurisdiction**: a set of doctrines about where, geographically, you can bring a lawsuit
* Competing considerations in determining personal jurisdiction
  * Fairness - There needs to be a relationship between a parties activity in a state and its liability to being sued in that forum
  * State Sovereignty - Serving within its own geographic boundaries is a power reserved by the state
* Disadvantages of Unlimited Personal Jurisdiction
  * Economic - Cost of litigating in a court that resides several states away
  * Differences in state law that may be more favorable to the plaintiffs claim
  * A hostile judiciary or one more sympathetic to plaintiff
  * Unfamiliarity with the particular state's court system

* Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  * Rule 4(e)
    * Unless otherwise prohibited, person can be served in a Federal judicial district by:
      1. Following state law for summoning as defined by court in the state where the Federal district is located
      2. Doing any of the following:
         * Personally delivering the summons
         * Delivering it to individual's dwelling in the possession of a competent individual
         * Delivering to an agent authorized by law or appointment to receive service of process
  * Rule 4(k)
    * Serving summons or filing a waiver establishes personal jurisdiction over an individual who:
      * Is subject to jurisdiction in the state where district is located or is served in a different judicial district no more than 100 miles away
      * Is not subject to **any** state court's jurisdiction

### *New York Times v. Sullivan*

New York Times files motion to quash service of process on several grounds, including lack of personal jurisdiction due to improper service. The court rejected this assertion and relied on three theories to establish personal jurisdiction. First, the court holds that the NYT waived its special appearance in its motion to quash because the challenge of subject matter jurisdiction was outside the scope of the stated specific purpose.
> This defendant cannot assert that that it is not properly before this Court, and in the same breath argue that if it is, this Court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action

In doing so, it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Next, the court found the Times' business activities sufficient as to subject it to jurisdiction for any claims existing out of such activities (*specific jurisdiction*) Finally, the Court found that:
> [The] systemic business dealings in Alabama give the Times substantial contact with the State of Alabama , considerably in excess of the minimal contacts required by the Supreme Court decisions....The times does business in Alabama.

This extensive and continuous business activity in Alabama, the court reasons, renders the Times as effectively "present" in the state. This would mean a claim wouldn't need to arise out of specific business dealings Hence, the motion to quash is denied.

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

* Subject Matter Jurisdiction
  * Authority of a court to adjudicate a particular type of case.
  * Determines federal/state scope of lawsuit
* Diversity of Citizenship
  * A basis for a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction over a case that arises due to parties in the suit residing in separate states
  * Requires complete diversity - the "domicility" of all juridical people on one side of a suit must be different than all parties on the other side.
* Removal refers specifically to moving case filed in state court to federal court
  * Removal is generally available when a case that was filed in state court could also have been filed in federal court as an original matter (also called original jurisdiction)
  * Party may exercise certain tactics when filing the claim so as to prevent defendant from removing to federal court
* Juridical Person: A "person", real or artificial, that is recognized for the purpose of a lawsuit.
  * Some entities, such of partnerships, are made up of several different juridical persons and thus has multiple citizenship for diversity purposes
* Fraudulent Joinder
  * A legal term of art used to describe parties that are included in a claim with which the plaintiff has no real cause of action with and were named for the purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction
  * The intent behind a joinder isn't sufficient to constitute as fraudulent. A joinder made with the intent of defeating diversity jurisdiction will likely be upheld if there is an actual claim against that party. The merit of the claim is what is important
  * A consequence of the fraudulent joinder doctrine is that a judge may "pierce the pleadings" in order to determine whether a party was fraudulently joined. Thus an inquiry into the merits of a claim takes place at a stage in the litigation where allegations are not typically subject to contention. This may create additional burdens for claimants in diversity jurisdiction cases

### *Rose v. Giamatti*

Pete Rose (P) files motion to have case remanded back to Ohio state courts after the MLB commissioner (D) removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiff challenges existence of diversity jurisdiction, citing two other parties named in the suit, the MLB and Cincinnati Reds, as citizens of the state of Ohio. Defendant contends that these parties were "fraudulently joined" to the suit in order to defeat removal jurisdiction.

In its decision, the Court cites the following well established legal doctrine:

* Plaintiff cannot defeat a defendant's right of removal by the "fraudulent joinder" of a non-diverse party against which the plaintiff has no real cause of action.
  * Court can consider both the pleadings and the entire record to make this determination
* Court must disregard nominal/formal parties and consider only the real parties to the controversy when determining diversity jurisdiction.
  * A nominal or formal party is one that has no interest in the result of the suit or no control over the subject matter in the litigation.

  The Court found that, on the basis of the allegations in the complaint, there was no controversy between Rose and the Cincinnati Reds, rendering the Reds as nominal party. Likewise, MLB was also found to be a nominal party. The League itself has no direct control over the commissioners actions, nor any obligation to moderate them. The controversy lies solely between Rose and the commissioner. Since the only real party, the commissioner, is a citizen of a different state, diversity jurisdiction is affirmed and the plaintiff's motion is denied.

# Pleadings

* Historical Development
  * Traditional pleadings procedures were inherited from English common law writ system an were complicated
    * Procedural split based on the type of claim
    * War of pleadings - Every pleading was met with a responsive pleading until issues emerged in a form proper for jury consideration
  * Reforms in mid-19th century New York culminated in the "Field Code"
    * Aimed to merge into a single pleading procedure that would govern all claims
    * Helped eliminate "war on pleadings" problem by abandoning, as a function of the pleadings, the narrowing of case to a single issue through numerous rounds of responses
    * Required plain and concise statement of facts making up cause of action, but court adopted technical rules for enforcing this standard that dismissed cases for being either too detailed or conclusory
* Notice Pleadings Standard
  * Established by FRCP Rule 8, required a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief
  * Primary purpose is to make allegations to put defendant on notice so as to enable them to prepare a response
  * Also helps frame for court the range of issues being disputed in the case
  * Defendant simply needs enough to know allegations made against him for which relief is sought
    * More detailed information sought about pleader's contentions must be obtained through discovery
  * Gibson v. Conley established a "no set of facts" test to help explain the notice pleadings standard and which persisted for several decades. Under this interpretation, a plaintiff is entitled to an assumption of truth in its allegations unless no set of facts could satisfy the evidentiary burden. The defendant must show show one of the following:
    * Their are logical inconsistencies in the claims, such that two facts could not be mutually true
    * The claims are so divorced from reality that no conceivable set of facts could possibly support them
  * This was the standard until Twombly in 2007

## Twombly Standard

* "In practices, a complaint...must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory."
* Conclusory Allegations v. Allegation of Fact
  * Conclusory Allegations
    * A bare restatement of elements in the cause of action or an allegation made by inferences drawn from other allegations. These are not entitled to a presumption of truth at the pleadings stage
    * Example: Regional providers conspired to prevent competitive entry into the telecom markets
    * Doesn’t mean that conclusory allegations should be ignored entirely. They may provide role in setting context for complaint's narrative and checking a box on an element of the cause of action. They just aren't sufficient on their own.
  * Allegations of Fact
    * Something that happened in the world. Assumed to be true at the pleadings stage.
    * Example: Representatives from the regional providers convened and entered an agreement not to compete outside their respective market.
  * A Primary task of court in determining if complain satisfies Twombly standard is to determine which claims are factual and which are conclusory.
* Plausibility Analysis
  * Examines relationship between factual allegations and conclusory ones
    * Distinction between an allegation describing a thing that happened in the world and a restatement/repackaging of elements in a cause of action
  * Court assumes the fact allegations to be true and looks at the conclusory allegations in the complaint's overall context to determine if the culpable inference is plausible based on the alleged facts
  * Though this isn't quite clear, for a culpable inference to be plausible, it must be, at a minimum, equally compelling as any other inference drawn from the same set of facts
  * Consequence is that it invites court to police what is plausible (i.e. what explanations of the facts is most likely) at the pleadings stage
* Justification for Standard
  * If plaintiff is permitted through pleadings stage without a claim that is strongly rooted in allegations of fact, they might be able to leverage expensive discovery process or sympathetic juries to benefit, either through settlement or judgement, despite bringing a "largely groundless claim"
  * Court must balance allowing groundless claims to "take up the time of a number of people" while scaring respondents into settlement  and the possibility of improperly dismissing meritable claims through an overly burdensome pleadings standard.

### *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*

Antitrust suit alleging regional telecom carriers were operating in restraint of trade by agreeing not to compete with each other and exclude other competitors. Court identifies the the essential question of law was whether there was agreement, tacit or express, between the carriers to engage in anti-competitive activities or if they were each acting independently in parallel. The complaint appears to satisfy the function of informing defendants of the claims. However, it does not reference any specific instances of the wrong doing. The complaint points out evidence that market is both structured in a way that supports the conclusion of operating to restrict trade and provides incentives for doing so. However, these are only allegations of parallel conduct and not of conspiracy. The Court finds that the bare allegations of conspiracy in this complaint are not allegations of fact, but conclusory allegations, thus not entitled to the presumption of truth. Court rejects prima facie interpretation of Conley, as such conclusory statements would survive pleadings stage if there was even a slight chance that discovery would reveal evidence supporting recovery. Instead, court requires that allegations of facts state claim that is plausible on its face. In light of the true "allegations of facts" pleaded in the case, the court ruled, the claim of conspiracy had not crossed the line from conceivable to plausible and should therefore be dismissed

### *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*

P allege that government perpetuated acts of illegal assault and torture against detainees on the basis religion and national origin. Allegations identify Ds as those responsible for architecting the policy and ordering its execution. Court references "flexible plausibility standard" in *Twombly* which where factual allegations must amplify claim where necessary to render it plausible. It identifies two principles from its *Twombly* decision: (1) the presumption of truth is inapplicable to conclusory statements and (2) only a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss, which is a context-specific determination the court is tasked with reviewing. Applying these standards, it determines that P's allegations about being subject to supervisory liability were mere legal conclusions and not entitled to a presumption of truth. Likewise, the plausibility analysis was left to the discretion of the court where it found the claim was a less plausible explanation of the allegation of facts than an explanation in which the policy's impact on specific religious groups or nationalities was simply incidental. Since the plausibility standard had not been satisfied, court remands CoA's decision to deny motion to dismiss complaint.

## Pleadings Motions

* Distinction between an answer and a motion to dismiss
  * Motion is not an affirmative defense, hence no assertions about what did/didn't happen. Only assertions on face of plaintiffs complaint.
  * Argument that plaintiff has not satisfied burden based on the inferences that can be drawn from allegations in the complaint.
* Rule 12 Motions
  * If you are going to raise a Rule 12 motion, you only have one opportunity to do so (with a few exceptions). If a party believes it has multiple grounds for dismissal, it needs to join them all together.
  * Failing to assert a specific defense when filing a Rule 12 motion results will likely result the waiver of that defense
  * Rule 12(b): Pre-answer motions for dismissal
    * Must be made before responsive pleadings
    * Among the defenses that can be asserted are lack of subject matter/personal jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and insufficient process.
  * Rule 12(c): Motion for judgement on the pleadings - At end of pleadings stage, either party can move for judgement based on what has been established in the pleadings. Challenge to the legal sufficiency of a complaint or an affirmative defense.
  * Rule 12(e): Motion for a more definite statement - If granted, court affirms that some language is too ambiguous or vague that a party can't prepare a reasonable response. Court orders amendment to the original complaint within 14 days or it may strike pleading.

## Amendments to Pleadings

* Rule 15(a) - Before Trial
  * A party allowed amend its pleadings once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving
  * An other amendments to pleadings must be done only with opposing party's written consent
* Court should "freely give leave" meaning it should be permissive with amendments unless it prejudices opposing party
* Relation Back
  * In adding a claim to a law suit, one must still satisfy statue of limitation.
  * Rule 15 holds that if a claim arose out of the same occurrence/transaction as did the original complaint, then the claim is timely if the original claim was timely.
  * If a claim would join new defendants, that party must be served process within the statute of limitation unless:
    * Genuine mistake identifying the proper party
    * Proper party knew or should have known the action would have been brought against it but for a mistake concerning proper party's identity

# Sanctions and Obligations of Counsel

## Rule 11

* Sets a standard of reasonableness and effort that is exercised in paper filings submitted to court
  * This includes briefs, motions, pleadings, etc.
  * These paper filings must be signed by at least one attorney of record
  * Exception: discovery stage, which is governed by its own rules
  * Exception: things that aren’t papers submitted to the court (personal letters, etc.)
* **Rule 11(b) - Representations to Court**
  * Requirement to proceed with competence and good faith. One must make arguments/paper filings that meet a certain threshold of professionalism. Arguments that knowingly/negligently misstate the law/controlling authority may be found to be an affirmative misrepresentation to the court, which is sanctionable under Rule 11(b).
  * By signing/submitting filing to court, attorney is certifying that to the best of its knowledge, following reasonable inquiry, the filing:
    1. Is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or delay
    1. Contains claims/contentions warranted by existing law or non-frivolous arguments to extend law
    1. Factual contentions have some evidentiary support and denials are reasonably based on belief or lack of knowledge (i.e. not directly lying to the court or making up facts)
  * This is so lawyers don’t misrepresent the law or facts, either purposefully or through their own incompetence
  * Relationship with Rule 12: Balance between specificity of allegations necessary to satisfy pleadings standards and the certainty of the allegations made in good faith. A party can't simply make up details that aren't grounded in material fact
* **Rule 11(c) - Sanctions**
  * 11(c)(2) - Motion for sanctions must be made separately from other motions and must identify the conduct in violation. Opposing party must be given opportunity to withdraw offering document before opposing party can file sanctions motion (21 days)
  * 11(c)(3) - Court can also initiate sanctions on its own and provide party with opportunity to show cause as to why its conduct has not violated Rule 11(b)
  * 11(c)(4) - Purpose of sanctions is to deter sanctionable conduct, not punishment or compensation
    * No Jackpot rule: Professional impact of sanctions are damaging enough
  * Either the party's attorney or a party itself can be sanctioned, depending on who was responsible for the violation
    * Assumption is that the attorney is responsible, though still possible for a party to be sanctioned
    * Non-delegatable duty to investigate. Attorney cannot blindly rely on client assertions if independent corroboration is readily available
    * Rule 11(b)(2) is an exception, as monetary damages for frivolous suit falls entirely on the attorne

### *Christian v. Mattel*

Party in suit motions for sanctions, contending that the opposing party brought frivolous action. TC grants it and orders sanctioned party, under Rule 11, to pay for other party's attorney fees. CoA reviews decision for abuse of discretion. **Courts ability to sanction attorney conduct under Rule 11 does not extend to discovery abuses or misstatements made to court during an oral presentation**. While CoA finds no abuse of discretion, it can't conclude for certain that granting of actions by TC was on the basis of conduct falling under the scope Rule 11, as opposed to improper conduct outside of paper filings. Thus, CoA remands to give TC an opportunity to delineate the basis for its imposing of sanctions.

### *Revson v. Cinque & Cinque*

Attorney for party (P) sent an aggressive letter to get client files from D, who previously represented P in lawsuit but was dismissed after dispute over fees. At one point in the letter, P's attorney threatens to perform the legal equivalent of a “proctology exam” and disrupt D's business with other clients, among other things. Dispute eventually leads to litigation where the lower court imposed sanctions on P's attorney not P, since the attorney represented to the court that he was responsible for litigation decisions and strategy. Additionally, the sanctions imposed by lower court did not fall under Rule 11, since the conduct was not part of any filing, but court's inherent authority under statute. CoA reviewed decision and held that, even though behavior is distasteful, it’s not sanctionable under the circumstances. The conduct, despite being obnoxious and malicious, had some merit based on the context (need to quick receipt of files, D's performance as an attorney being at issue in the case, etc.)

# Discovery

* Discovery process in modern litigation
  * Consensus exists that the more parties know, the better
  * A party can still prevail even if proof of the claim/defense is in the possession of an opponent or an uncooperative non-party. However, discovery is still dependent on cooperation and good faith relations between parties
  * Courts not particularly interested in resolving discovery disputes. Onces parameters are set through reasonable negotiations, they will leave parties to it
    * "Parameters" are typically contemplating during Rule 26(f) pretrial conferences and outlined in the discovery plan. This includes time, subject matter, disclosure, and privilege parameters
    * Role of court varies, though the court is invited by the rules to play an active managerial role in discovery planning and help guide towards the possibility of settlement
  * Mechanism established under Rules 26 and 37 are a significant shift from predecessor in which such inquiry was burdensome
    * The pre-trial functions of issue-formulation and fact-revelation had previously been performed (inadequately, one might note) by the pleadings. New rules limit function of pleads to general notice giving
    * The shift provided discovery with a vital role in trial preparation, helping narrow/clarify basic issues and ascertain both facts and information about the existence/whereabouts of facts

## Required Disclosures

* Initial Disclosures
  * The requirement for initial disclosures was strengthened significantly in 2000
  * Under Rule 26(a)(1), a party must produce certain information at the outset of litigation without awaiting a discovery request
    1. List of all persons likely to have discoverable information, but only those to be used be disclosing party. There is no obligation to identify parties that are not relied on by the disclosing party
    1. A copy, or description/location, of documents and electronically stored information that disclosing party possesses and may use in its claim
  * Must be made within 14 days of Rule 26(f) conference unless a party objects to the appropriateness of initial disclosures, at which point a new timeline will be set when the court rules on the objection
  * A party must produce information reasonably available to it. It is not excused from making disclosures because it has not investigated
* Expert Testimony
  * Under Rule 26(a)(2), a party must inform each other about any expert witnesses they intend to call at trial
  * Includes providing the identity of the retained expert accompanied by a written report containing:
    * A statement about the opinions the witness will express and basis of the reasoning
    * facts or data considered in forming the opinions and exhibits that wil be used to support them
    * witnesses qualifications/credentials and any other cases in which similar testimony was provided

## Adversarial Discovery

* Rule 26(b) relates to the scope of discovery. There is both a broad standard of relevance applied to discoverable information as well as a proportionality standard
  * Relevance Standard
    * The information is relevant to any claim or defense
    * Typically applied very broadly
  * Proportionality Standard
    * Balance test between burden to disclosing party and benefit to requesting party
    * Takes into consideration: Issues and damages at stake, cost and time needed to obtain discovery, and other opportunities available to the requesting party
    * Burden to show proportionality now falls on the requesting party, a shift in the burden which had traditionally fallen on disclosing party
    * Cost/Benefit assessment for discovery has been employed to apply proportionality standard
* Responsive Documents
  * A term of art referring to things that fall under scope of what plaintiff asked for in a request
    * Gold standard is to bring in third party to determine and apply scope to documents
* Procedures to Block and Compel Discovery
  * Objections
    * Refusal to produce requested information offered in lieu of a response
    * Places the burden of judicial intervention on the party seeking discovery, though the basis for the objection must be stated
    * In depositions, testimony is taken subject to objection unless privilege is being asserted
  * In asserting privilege by withholding certain protected information, a party must notify the requesting party
    * Notice must contain sufficient amount of detail so as to explain the basis for the privilege
    * This allows the requesting party to contend opposing party's exercise of privilege
  * Rule 37(a) Motion to Compel
    * Requesting party can challenge objection. If court finds the objection was unfounded, it will order a response and award the moving party attorney fees in making the motion
  * Protective Orders
    * Refusing party can preemptively seek judicial intervention under Rule 26(c) to prevent or limit the scope of an intervention
    * Requires showing of good cause
      * Example: The discovery sought would disclose proprietary information which would put the disclosing party at a disadvantage
  * Sanctions
    * Rule 37(b) and 37(d) provides sanctions for parties who fail to make disclosures or act in good faith
    * In addition to these sanctions, the damage to a party's credibility resulting from such conduct will make it difficult to advocate for it's client in subsequent stages of the litigation
* Discovery Devices
  * Rule 33 Interrogatories
    * Can only be served to parties of litigation and allowed maximum 25 total questions
    * Answers to interrogatories must be given after reasonable investigation, "I don't know" is not an adequate response
    * Allows probe into opponents legal theories or evidentiary support
      * Not objectionable merely because it asks for opinion or contention related to a fact or application of the law
    * Limited insofar as follow up responses are not normally possible
  * Rule 30 Depositions
    * Examinations of a witness under oath, recorder for possible later use in the proceedings
    * Any person with relevant information can be deposed and any party can attend a deposition
    * Advantage over interrogatories is that they allow for follow up questioning
    * Limitation of these is that deponent has no obligation to prepare or follow up, they can simply defer if they don't have a response
  * Rule 34 Requests for Production
    * Permits party to inspect/copy documents or other tangible evidence within another party's control/custody
    * Preserving the order/location/state of documents is an obligation because it is important metadata
      * Can reveal information about who knew/was responsible which isn't present in the documents themselves
    * Often occurs in several rounds as production of documents reveals more information about other available discoveries
  * Rule 35 Mental and Physical Examinations
    * Unlike other devices, these exams require a prior court order "for good cause shown." This is due to their highly invasive nature
    * To show good cause, one must affirmatively show that the condition being sought for examination is genuinely in controversy
      * A movant cannot simply rely on the contents of the pleadings or conclusory allegations, though they aren't required to go as far as proving their case on the merits
      * Court may hold evidentiary hearing, though it isn't necessary in all cases
    * Consequences
      * Party who moved for exam must, upon request, provide copy of examiner's report along with all other like reports on the same condition
      * If examined party requests examiner's report, they must, upon request, provide moving party with any other like reports of the same condition
  * Rule 36 Requests for Admissions
    * The ministerial version involves the authentication of documents
    * The more substantial version involves requests that your opponent admit facts, application of law to facts, or opinions about either two
    * Responding party is under a duty of reasonable inquiry to determine the truth of each, though this may be advantageous in some ways (see section on prior adjudication)
    * Financial incentive to admit - If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and the requesting party later proves the matter on there own, they can move that the requestee pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof. This does not apply to requests that were deemed to be inappropriate or where there are reasonable grounds for the party's failure to admit
  * Other Devices
    * Stipulations
      * Parties can choose to enter written agreement in which they consent to treat certain facts as true in their dispute
      * This can save unnecessary time and expenses
      * Courts generally hold such stipulation agreements as binding for the purposes of the litigation
    * eDiscovery
      * Computerized information is discoverable as a matter of black letter law
      * Subject to the same rules and scope as other discoverable information, such as the proportionality and relevance standards

## Privilege

* Privileged communications are protected from disclosure
  * It represents a sacrifice of the accuracy of adjudication in order to encourage/facilitate certain relationships
  * Attorney has obligation to take action on what client tells him, so long as the substance of the communication is not disclosed
  * Attorney-client privilege only applies to communication between attorney and client. If shared with third party, the privilege is destroyed
* Justification for privilege
  * Theory is that client would not be completely candid with her attorney if she feared that her discussion would later be revealed against here wishes
  * Privilege prevents a client from self-censoring discussions with attorney out of a potentially incorrect understanding of the legal implications of the truth. In order to provide effective advice, attorney must be armed with all of the facts
  * It also helps attorney prevent client from presenting inaccurate information to the court
* Waiver of privilege
  * Can be waived either deliberately or inadvertently
  * In doing so, a party is waiving protection to **all** related subject matter
  * Parties can form binding agreements that inadvertent disclosure of privileged information will not result in waiver. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) also does this to an extent.

## Work Product

* Work Product
  * Rule 26(b)(3) recognizes presumption of privilege for materials prepared in anticipation of litigation (i.e. work product) unless:
    1. They are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1)
    2. AND the requesting party has shown there is substantial need for the materials in order to prepare for case
    3. AND the materials (or their equivalent) can't be obtained without hardship
  * Even if the aforementioned criteria are shown, Rule 26(b)(3)(B) may nonetheless protect certain information
    * Rule states that court shall protect against disclosure of mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal theories of a party's attorney
  * Testimony from experts not being retained is considered work product and not subject to required disclosure
  * Work Product Protection <> Privilege
    * It simply places a limit on what is discoverable
    * Some states don't enforce this protection as broadly
  * Justifications
    * Historically speaking, lawyer is officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while protecting rightful interests of their client. In performing these duties, it is essential a lawyer is able to work with certain degree of privacy and free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing party. Proper preparation requires an attorney to sift through facts and prepare theories without needless and undue interference

### *Hickman v. Taylor*

P suing D after a tug owned by D P sunk while helping to tow a car float, resulting in the death of five crew members. D hires law firm in anticipation of lawsuit from relatives of deceased crew members and privately interviews survivors. After a claim is filed by P, several interrogatories were filed, including one that inquired into the communication D had with survivors and a request for any statements made. D's representation declined this on grounds that it requested privileged material?? Trial ordered D them to comply. Upon appeal, CoA reversed judgement asserting that information was part of the lawyer's work product and thus privileged under FRCP. Supreme court recognized the function of discovery under rule 26 calls for narrow application of the "privileged" limitation on discoverable materials. Since the information at issue was obtained by D's representation from a third-party, it is not protected by attorney client privilege and P's request is properly discoverable. However, court also identifies that the information sought by P is readily available and could be obtained without any hardship. Further, no attempt has been made by P to show that the information sought is of substantial need and D's failure to produce would prejudice their preparation. Hence, the attempt to obtain work product *without* justification falls outside the boundaries of discovery under Rule 26. The CoA's judgement is affirmed by the court.

# Summary Judgement

## Rule 56 Summary Judgement

* Pretrial device to test the factual and/or legal sufficiency of a pleading at the close of discovery
  * Motion for full or partial summary judgment within 30 days of the close of discovery
  * Court typically looks at facts in a light favorable to non-moving party
* Purpose of summary judgement is to infer, from the record, whether a party could conduct a competent trial that a reasonable jury could find compelling.
  * Non-moving party must demonstrate that it can do so, even if evidence is not in an admissable form
* Either P or D (or both) may move for summary judgement
  * Burden of production: What moving party must come forward with for their motion to be considered
  * Burden of persuasion: What moving party must persuade court that there is no genuine issue of material fact from their position
  * Typically, P carries the burden of producing evidence on every contested element of its complaint
  * Defensive motions are those filed by D. D must show that P's evidence failed to establish genuine issue. The burden of production then shifts to P, who must point evidence in record showing disputes in fact. Burden of persuasion still remains with D.
  * Defensive motions for summary judgement are far more prevalent and make up majority of case law, but offensive motions can and do occur. In these cases, burden is significantly higher. P must demonstrate that **all** of the pertinent evidence points in only one direction, conclusively demonstrating the truth of its allegations.
* Rule 56(c): Granting SJ is proper if record shows there are no genuine issues as to any material fact (i.e. no reason to subject it to trier of fact) and the moving party is entitled to judgement as a mater of law.
  1. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
     * (A) Citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
     * (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
  2. A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.
* Rule 56(d): If respondent believes discovery period has been inadequate when summary judgement is motioned for, allows respondent to move for additional time at court's discretion
* Rule 56(f): Courts can make judgments independent of a motion or the party filing the motion
* Court Interpretation of Rule 56
  * *Celotex* is concerned with the burden of the moving party in showing the absence of issues of material fact. Moving party must go beyond simply asserting "You've got nothing" or putting opposing party to its proof, but need not show by preponderance of the evidence that opposing parties claims are false
    * Example: if defendant propounded an interrogatory that said, “Identify every document you claim demonstrates, or tends to demonstrate, that Mr. Catrett was exposed to defendant’s asbestos,” and the answer to that interrogatory is, “Plaintiff is aware of no such documents,” then that interrogatory answer is a part of the discovery record that demonstrates an absence of material in support of plaintiff’s claim.
      * Affidavits showing absence not necessary so long as standard of entry of summary judgement is satisfied.
      * "One of the principal purposes of the summary judgement rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defense...it should be interpreted in a way that allows it to accomplish this purpose"
  * In minority view, pointing out part of the record that demonstrates absence of factual basis for plaintiff's claim shifts burden on resisting party to show otherwise
* No genuine dispute of material fact
  * Standard depends on judge's conclusion that no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party based on the evidence of record
  * Deferential Standard is to draw inferences most favorable to plaintiff
    * Neglected in *Harris* because Justice Scalia claims video resolves any dispute of facts - weakening of the standard
      * Begging the question: summary judgement is a device used to determine whether there are disputes of material fact, but Scalia proposes court only make inferences favorable to non-moving party where facts are genuinely disputable. Absence of genuine dispute of material fact is already assumed prior to the analysis.
  * *Harris* court takes away the decision from the jury, even when there seem to be clear issues of triable fact (video is interpreted differently throughout multiple courts)

### *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*

D files motion for summary judgement on grounds that there is no evidence in support of wrongful death claim. District court grants motion, reasoning that there was no showing D's product was linked to wrongful death. Court of Appeals holds that the summary judgement was defective because the motioning party made no effort and thus failed to produce evidence showing the absence of any issues of fact, citing FRCP Rule 56(e). Supreme court rejects CoA's interpretation of Rule 56. It affirms rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgement after adequate amount of time for discovery if a party fails to sufficiently show an element essential to their claim. It also agrees **that party seeking judgement bears initial responsibility for informing the court of the basis of its motion and identifying items in the record, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue. However, the court found no requirement, express or implied in Rule 56, for a party to make an affirmative evidentiary showing that would negate its opponent's claims**. Instead, the portion of Rule 56(e) that is at issue was intended to prevent resistance of summary judgement by opposing parties who simply reference the pleadings and conclusory assertions. The courts decision clarifies *Adickes*: Rule 56 should not be construed to mean the burden is on the moving party to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Instead, burden on moving party is satisfied by "showing" (i.e. pointing out) that there is an absence of evidence to support the opposing party's case.

## Scott v. Harris

P is paralyzed after he is involved in a car crash while attempting to flee police. The officer pursuing P caused the accident while attempting to immobilize the vehicle. Video evidence is presented and D moves for summary judgement based on qualified immunity. TC denies motion for summary judgement, finding there are issues of material fact. CoA affirms District Court. Supreme Court grants certiorari. Court rules that **when the facts present by the non-moving party so blatantly contradict a parties claims, the court does not need to hold them in a light favorable to him/her when considering a summary judgment motion**. In light of video evidence, Scott’s attempts to terminate dangerous high-speed car case that threatened innocent lives did not violate the 4th Amendment, even if the motorist was a risk of serious injury or death. The consequence of this decision is that the court takes away the decision from the jury, even when there seem to be clear issues of triable fact on which a jury may draw on a separate body of knowledge and reasoning when weighing evidence

# Trial

## Civil Jury Trials

* "Right" to jury trial in civil actions derived from 7th Amendment, though only applies at federal level. States not obliged to guarantee civil trial by jury
  * Actions seeking equitable relief don't typically have this right extended to them, unless the underlying facts overlap with that of a claim for compensatory relief
  * Judge and Jury
    * Law-fact allocation: juries only hear what judges deem appropriate evidence
      * Greatest control judge has over jury is the power to prevent case from ever reaching a jury and/or issuing a JNOV
      * Verdicts once rendered make it very difficult to overturn based on a factual determination by the jury
    * Benefits of the jury system
      * Ordinary citizens determine the law
      * Civic participation and community sensibility
  * Detriments of the jury system:
    * Complex subject matter
    * Inconsistencies and unpredictability
* Rule 38 - Demanding a Jury Trial
  * Must request within 14 days
  * Parties usually put requests in pleading docs

## Trial Procedure

* Pre-Trial Order
  * Constructed in pretrial conference following discovery. Rule specifies the order can only be modified to avoid "manifest injustice" The reasoning behind this is to eliminate potential for a "trial-by-surprise"
  * Parties will establish how many days trial will be, what witnesses, expert testimony, and documents the parties want to present, the admissibility of evidence. This happens as close to the day of trial as possible
  * Any evidence offered that is not included in the Final Pretrial Order may be excluded from the trial if the opposing party objects to its introduction
  * Inclusion of witness, evidence, etc. does not obligate parties to present them. Instead, it maps out everything that *can* happen in trial
* Voir Dire
  * People called for jury service show up in the venire of potential jurors, fill out a questionnaire, are asked questions by either the judge or the lawyers in a process called voir dire (“speaking the truth”).
  * Purpose is to determine if the prospective jurors have personal knowledge of facts/circumstances surrounding the case, including any personal relationships with either party, and to see if the juror can be impartial and make decisions based on the evidence presented rather than coming in with a preconceived idea of what party should win
  * Jurors are stricken “for cause” if they have some connection to the case or cannot be impartial. Unlimited number of these challenges
  * Preemptory challenges used to strike jurors without cause. Alloted 3 of them. Important series of cases addressing use of these challenges for purposes that are discriminatory and that constitution deems inappropriate (i.e. on the basis of sex or race)
    * Function is to challenge causes that are difficult to articulate
* Once a jury is seated, the parties begin presentation. P goes first. The goal is to put on a legally sufficient case and also weaving together a compelling narrative to the jury. Trials are about telling stories; the best trial lawyers can keep strategic legal questions in their head while also weaving together a compelling story to the jury.
* **Rule 50(a) - Judgement as a Matter of Law (JAML)**
  * Judgement awarded after party has an opportunity to present evidence, legal theories, and conclusion on grounds they have failed to establish sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find in their favor
  * Should be granted if "a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is not legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue"
  * Primary difference between Rule 56 and Rule 50 -A fight over Rule 56 motion looks at the discovery record. A fight over Rule 50 motion looks at the trial record
  * Reason a JAML may be granted despite surviving summary judgement:
    * Key piece of evidence could not be put into admissible form. Body of evidence court scrutinizes is different from that presented at trial
      * Example: Witness recanting testimony
    * Evidence that was compelling on its face failed to withstand questioning at trial
  * Four Categories of Analytical Questions when Drawing Inferences
    1. What evidence is in front of you?
    2. What kinds of inferences based on evidentiary record about what else maybe going on; what circumstantial evidence?
    3. What kinds of assumptions about how this situation usually works?
    4. Questions about social policy and normative values in relation to requirements of substantive rule?
  * *Dixon*
    * Central issue: where you have a case where there is some evidence, but unavoidable indeterminacy, how much can people rely on instinct and their view about what typically happens in this kind of situation and still say that they are acting as reasonable jurors?
    * CoA made a unilateral decision to override jury decision based on a set of assumptions it used to conclude P's theory was unreasonable, raising questions/concerns
      * Does the court overstep its role over the jury in making an inference about execution of Walmart’s cleaning policies?
      * Rule 50 stipulates that the court examine the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party - here there seem to be credibility determinations)
    * There is an unavoidable element of indeterminacy that, as a matter of social policy, might be best answered by a jury
* **Rule 50(b) - Renewed Motion**
  * Motion must be filed within 28 days of entry of judgment, and **only** available if a 50(a) motion was previously filed
  * In cases where the jury decides correctly, it eliminates the need for the motion and the risk of reversal on appeal
  * Frequently seen as a “workaround” to protection against reexamination in jury cases. Enables court to circumvent this while rendering its own judgement not withstanding the verdict because motion was raised before verdict is reached and simply continued afterwords at court's discretion
* **Rule 59 - Motion for a New Trial**
  * Standard is the discretion of the judge
  * Why would a court grant 59?
    * Incorrect trial, jury made inferences deemed unreasonable in light of available evidence
    * Attorney misconduct: improper evidence, improper invitation of jurors to bias
    * Can grant 59 motion without review
* Rule 50(b) and 59 motions must be made within 28 days of verdict

### *Dixon v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.*

P's feet get tangled in plastic binder wrap at Walmart (D) checkout line, she is seriously injured, and she sues D for negligence. P's theory is that the binder got on the floor in the morning during newspaper delivery, and that it was on the ground for 8 hours, hence D should reasonably have been discovered by store employees. Under Texas tort law, she needed to prove that D had constructive knowledge of the binder wrap and failed to exercise reasonable care in spite of that knowledge. Sole issue on appeal is whether P established sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find that D had constructive knowledge. P argues D must have had knowledge due to proximity of binder wrap to cashier. However, court holds proximity evidence alone is insufficient - must be temporal evidence showing D had enough time to exercise reasonable care. Court then rules there was **nothing in the evidentiary record that could lead a reasonable jury to believe binding was present long enough to prove constructive knowledge**. Thus, court allows JAML for D

# Appeals

## Appealability

* Entry of final judgment marks the formalized resolution of the dispute with respect to its disposition and also creates a point of reference about timing questions and about preclusion doctrine (what factual and legal questions have been conclusively determined by these two parties that may bind them in future disputes)
  * Final judgment rule §28 USC 1291 - Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all **final decisions** of the district courts of the United States (and other territories) No appeals from non-final judgments with three primary exceptions (see 1292 and Rule 54)
    * Benefits: No constant interruption of litigation timeline and allows full development of facts that may weigh on legal question at issue
    * This comes at a cost, as court rulings at intermediate stages of litigation have significant impact and forces party to continue costly litigation where it might not be warranted, often placing significant pressure for settlement
  * Rule 54(b) Multiple claims and parties
    * Gives TC flexibility to issue a partial judgement (e.g. judgement on one of several claims) if it deems so to be in the interest of justice provides final judgement for a single issue/party in the litigation, allowing appeal to be raised without awaiting final judgement on remaining litigation
* Three main categories of exception to final judgement rule:
  * **Collateral Order Doctrine**
    * Identifies situations where issue in case implicates important values (usually constitutional or legislated value) distinct from merits of lawsuit and where in the absence of an immediate opportunity to address the issue, it would effectively lose its benefit/value. 
    * This is a narrow category. Example: Qualified immunity being improperly denied
    * Court justifies this doctrine by treating the district court’s decision on that issue as basically a “final judgment” on that issue and therefore appealable right away.
    * Internal court matters, such as discovery, do not fall within the scope of collateral order
  * **Interlocutory**- Two Avenues
    1. Section 1292(a) Request for injunctive relief
       * Most expansive review - Failure to immediately grant injunctions lead to significant/irreparable consequences to party which would be unjust
       * Preliminary injunction operates to preserve the status quo or provide relief during the pendency of litigation
         * Example: "don't clear the forest until the case is completed"
         * Is exercised frequently and appellate court obligated to hear it
    1. Section 1292(b) Discretionary appeals
       * Order involves a "controlling question of the law" as to which there are "substantial grounds for difference in opinion" and which immediate appeal of may materially advance resolution of the litigation
       * Trial court has discretion over whether this section is applicable to the question, and if so, the CoA has discretion to take for appeal
         * Neither decision is reviewable
  * **Extraordinary writs**
    * Power of federal courts to issue mandatory orders in order to preserve authority.This doctrine is sometimes available where a lower court is committing an error that goes to fundamental questions about the type of power the court is exercising, such as proceeding in a way that exceeds bounds of its legitimate authority
    * Appellant must convince the appellate court that what’s happening is qualitatively illegitimate
    * Writ of prohibition - Order to refrain from some action
    * Writ of mandamus (requires a judge to exercise judicial authority)
* Prevailing Party Doctrine: Appeal not available for those awarded **all** sought after relief
  * Why winners appeal:
    1. Could have adverse fact findings tha could impact party
    1. Could establish precedent unfavorable in future litigation
* Filing the Appeal
  * After final judgment, you have 30 days to file notice of appeal. This is enforced strictly, per the federal rules of appellate procedure
  * Preserving issues for appeal through adequate objection -	If you don’t object, you can’t appeal
  * Notice of Appeal
    * Appellant must file “notice of appeal” – document identifying party, judgment, and court
    * Rule 4(a)(1)(A) – appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of judgment (or when post-verdict motions are fully decided)
    * Other party has 14 days after to cross-appeal
  * Appellate Record: aka “The Appendix”
    * All materials from discovery and trial
* Disposition: appellate courts do not require any particular form of written resolution, whether verbal or written
  * Can reverse without opinion
* Rehearing/Rehearing En Banc
  * Parties may seek a rehearing within 14 days of appellate judgment
  * Majority of active judges on the circuit must grant the rehearing

---

## Standards of Review

* De Novo (Plenary)
  * Most complete review - no formal deferential to lower court. Usually applied to questions of law without any weight to lower court's ruling (i.e. tried as if new). The signature issue subject to de novo review is question of law (though this distinction isn't always clear)
* Clearly Erroneous (Clear Error)
  * Usually reserved to finding of facts if by lower court judge. Only non-deferential if there is a "definite and firm conviction" of a mistake. An assumption here is that there is in fact a right answer to the factual questions
    * If jury was trier of fact, appellate court can’t review because of 7th amendment protection. However, appellate court can review through other means such as an appeal from a ruling on a Rule 50 motion
* Abuse of Discretion
  * Review of legal rulings involving balance of factors left to discretion of trial judge. Standard is that CoA should not substitute its judgement unless the balancing of the factors falls outside the boundaries of reasonableness
  * An assumption here is that there isn’t a single right answer but rather that the the judge is invited to use its judgment in determining the best course of action
    * Also limited in decisions rendered by juries due to 7th amendment

### *Pullman-Standard v. Swint*

Civil rights lawsuit concerning the seniority process at the Pullman-Standard plant. Ps contend freight car union has a discriminatory (albeit indirectly) seniority system. TC found that there was no discriminatory intent. CoA reversed and ruled that there was, arguing "because the issue was the ultimate issue in the case, it can be subject to de novo review and not subject to standard of deference". SCOTUS grants certiorari and held that CoA did not apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. **Must defer to lower court judge's fact finding unless there is “definite and firm conviction that an error has been made.”** However, the issue of discriminatory intent was purely factual one and the CoA did not establish that there was a clear mistake in the lower courts fact finding, thus the conclusions drawn from its own independent fact finding were inappropriate.

# Personal Jurisdiction

* Two constitutional provisions are relevant here
  1. Full Faith and Credit Clause Article IV, Section 1 - Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial proceedings in every other state
     * Compels enforcement of one state's judicial proceedings in other state, but does not require out-of-state enforcement if determined the court issuing judgement lacked jurisdiction over the defendant
  1. Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment - No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law
     * Has been used to prohibit excessive assertions of jurisdiction by state courts
* Specific vs General Jurisdiction
  * **General** - Category where court has decided entity is under its jurisdiction for **any** claim. No need to show relation between claim D's presence in the state
  * 2 main forms of general jurisdiction
    1. State where they are domiciled
    1. Tag jurisdiction: Physically served process within state boundaries. Constitutionality valid exercise of personal jurisdiction
  * **Specific**: claim in which plaintiff is seeking jurisdiction over D arises out of, or relates to, D's contacts or activities in a state. Since general jurisdiction is only available in narrow set of circumstances, specific jurisdiction is typically exercised when suing out-of-state corporation.

* Process for personal jurisdiction
  * Start with source of state authority for exercising PJ
  * General and specific provide two very different pathways. In many cases, only one of these paths may be relevant based on the facts

## Traditional Bases of Jurisdiction

### Power Over Person and Property

* In rem - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction in relation to property within its borders
* In personam - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction over a person within its borders
* Quasi in rem - Courts jurisdiction over the interests of particular parties in a thing
* Pennoyer Court identifies two principles of law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property
  * Dependent on property physically residing in forum state and may or may not be
  1. Every State possess exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. Thus, it has power to govern property, contractual relationships, etc.
  1. No State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons aor property without its territory. States are independent and equal in authority/dignity, thus implying the exclusion of power from all others within its territory.
* Summons is formal mechanism by which court attaches its power over the defendant. It is akin to the service process in English common law in which an officer might be sent to physically compel ("put hands on") the respondent to answer. Sending an officer into CA to drag the defendant back to OR would clearly be an encroachment of the police powers held by CA over its territory.
  * Problem with this view - It effectively bars actions against residents of other states, allowing some to easily evade law suits.
* Historical relevance and context behind this theory of jurisdiction
* Though modern approach has changed substantially, this demonstrates the evolution of the court's jurisdiction doctrine and some important considerations about legal authority in the federal court system.
* Pennoyer was heard during period of reconstruction following the Civil war. This provided an opportunity for the court to address issues state sovereignty and property rights that were in-flux.
* Raising Jurisdictional Objections
* If D believes jurisdiction over him is improper:
  * He can decline to appear and a default judgement will be entered. Such objections can be raised at proceedings to enforce judgement. Can also bring collateral suit to reclaim property, though risky.
  * Make special appearance to sole purpose of contesting jurisdiction
  * Can defend on the merits and still preserve right to appellate review of jursdictional objection.

#### *Pennoyer v. Neff*

Landmark case that represents the Supreme Court's initial effort to develop a conceptual framework for allocating adjudicatory authority among the states. It unfolded in thee separate proceedings.

##### Proceeding 1 - Mitchell v. Neff

Mitchell files suit against Neff in Oregon state court for unpaid attorney’s fees, less than $300. Mitchell publishes
notice in Pacific Christian Advocate, a local publication, as a substitute for traditional service of process. This is consistent with OR state law after failed attempts to locate D (though the adequacy of this type of notice and obtaining jurisdiction becomes an important issue). At this point, Neff is now a resident of California and is physically present there. Neff fails to respond and doesn’t show up to lawsuit, so court enters default judgment for nearly $300, but no way to execute judgement since D is nowhere to be found.

##### Proceeding 2 - Sheriff's Sale

Mitchell knew that D owned property in state valued around $15,000. He goes to Sheriff seeking judgement enforcement action by attaching this property. This property is auctioned off, with Mitchell himself being the winning bidder. Since proceeds of sale used to pay judgement, Mitchell gets back the money he paid in addition for the land. He then sells the land to a 3rd party, Pennoyer.

##### Proceeding 3 - Neff v. Pennoyer

After some time, Neff, unaware of both the judgement and subsequent auction, finds out Pennoyer is occupying the land and brings action for ejectment. The question of law for the court was whether Pennoyer's title to the land was valid due to the legitimacy of the judgement of of the first proceeding. Since Neff was a CA domiciliary at the time of filing the suit and his only relation to OR is with the plot of land he owns. However, Oregon court found there was personal jurisdiction over Neff for a different reason: state laws allowed Mitchell to use Neff’s property as proxy for his person. This is the concept of "quasi in rem" jurisdiction, exercise of jurisdiction over property, but where the lawsuit is not about the property itself but just using the property as a proxy. Thus, Oregon court held the initial judgement was valid.

##### Supreme Court Decision

Supreme Court ruled that the exercise over the defendant in the first proceeding was invalid because the property, which was used as a proxy for jurisdiction, was not attached at the outset of the lawsuit; it was only attached afterwards when seeking enforcement of the judgement. Court found that the failure to do so was a violation of due process. Attaching property when exercising in rem jurisdiction is necessary for court to be properly constituted and attachment is treated as the formal step in which court attaches power (functional equivalent of serving process in personam jurisdiction). Thus, Supreme Court holds default judgement was rendered without proper jurisdiction.

### Domicility and Consent

* Domicility
  * According to power theory, a state would not be unable to exercise jurisdiction over an individual outside of its boundaries, even if the individual is domiciled in that state.
  * Supreme Court held in Milken v. Meyer that responsibilities of citizenship arise of the relationship with state with which one is domiciled in and that these responsibilities simply don't dissolve because of someones physical absence from that state. Continuous presence is not necessary
* Consent
  * Individual voluntarily submitting themselves before the jurisdiction of a court, either implicitly or through some express act (e.g. choice of forum clause, voluntary appearance, etc.)
  * After Pennoyer, several decisions trying to work around the strictness set by the power theory

#### *Hess v. Pawloski*

P suffered injuries on highway in Massachusetts from D, who is driving through from PA. MA enacts law acknowledging that objections to personal jurisdiction can be waived; thus if you drive on the roads of MA, you will be deemed to have designated the secretary of state of MA to be your agent and you implicitly consent to MA’s jurisdiction (Service of summons on agent in MA, who then delivers it to D). Under Pennoyer, since MA does not have property or person of defendant, it shouldn’t be able to assert jurisdiction. Supreme Court rules that this does not conflict with due process, noting that driving is a dangerous activity and states need to control dangerous activity that happens on their roads and could theoretically exclude that activity altogether if they chose.

### Out-of-State Corporations Under Traditional Theories of Personal Jurisdiction

* A domestic corporation, seen analogous to an individual domiciliary, was subject to jurisdiction in the state of its corporation, regardless where service was made
  * PJ over subject based on location the service was made presented difficulties because corporations had no physical presence
  * Courts forced to consider alternative measures

---

## Minimum Contacts Standard - The Expansion of Personal Jurisdiction

### Minimum Contacts Standard

* **Has D established sufficient contacts or ties with the state of the forum to make it reasonable and just, according to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice, to permit the state to enforce the obligations which they have incurred there.**
* Formally affirmed by court in Intl Shoe, representing a sharp break from principles in Pennoyer
  * Pennoyer was a rules-based system, centered around principle of State sovereignty, with legal fiction workarounds to achieve sensible outcomes
  * Intl Shoe: standards-based paradigm that measures activity against notions of fairness and justice
    * Malleable and flexible, considers burdens and activities of D with benefits/privileges gained from forum which lead to obligations
* Fairness Analysis
  * Looks at “quality and nature” of defendant’s in-state activities. Is there a substantive relationship between defendant’s in-state contacts and what defendant is being sued over? D's contacts in state can't simply be incidental to the cause of action.
  * World Wide Volkswagen expands on the type of factors considered: [1] the burden on the defendant; [2] the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; [3] the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; [4] interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; [5] the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies
* Quid Pro Quo Element
  * Insofar as defendant enjoys benefits and protections of state, and insofar as plaintiff is suing about those specific activities then there is a concomitant obligation to be liable to suit in state

#### *International Shoe Co. v. Washington*

D has incorporated in DE. It has deliberately conducted its business activities in such a way to limit the states that can assert jurisdiction over it (e.g. no offices/storage of merchandise, f.o.b. shipping, etc). Washington sues for failure to contribute to unemployment fund under statute. Fundamental question of law: whether D, consistent with the limitations of the due process clause, has made itself amenable to proceedings in WA by its activities in the state. State of WA Supreme court held the continuous flow of its products into state was sufficient to constitute "doing business" so as to make it amenable to suit in WA. U.S Supreme court affirms, holding that **activities in forum State established “sufficient minimum contacts” that do not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice in asserting personal jurisdiction**. Looking at the quality of the in-state activity, court found they were regular and systematic, resulting in large volume of business through which D received benefits and protections of WA laws. These contacts, when balanced with the inconveniences that would result from holding D amenable to suit, were sufficient enough for court to find that jurisdiction would not be unreasonable or violate due process.

### Specific-Act Statutes

* Any question of personal jurisdiction typically involves:
  1. Is there a statutory grant of personal jurisdiction under state law that authorizes this proposed exercise of jurisdiction?
     * Specific-act-statues: State enacted statute that authorizes jurisdiction over nonresident defendants where the claim arose from certain in-state acts
     * "Sky’s the limit" statute: State authorizes that effectively authorizes all jurisdiction within constitutional boundaries
  1. Are there due process consequences?
     * Why are we so concerned about D's rights, especially to the detriment of P's interest? Because the defendant is the one who is being subjected to coercive power of court and is at risk of being deprived of rights

#### *McGee v. International Life Insurance*

California has a specific statute that authorizes personal jurisdiction. Mother of decedent sues in California, obtains a default judgment when the defendant refuses to appear, and tries to collect on the default judgment in Texas. Insurance company argues that CA courts had no jurisdiction. TX courts deny enforcement of the judgement. Supreme court holds D, an insurance company in TX, established sufficient minimum contacts to California forum with single insurance contract. Court recognizes state's has strong interest in protecting citizens and the need to expand the scope due to a modernizing economy. Court rules that California court did have personal jurisdiction.

#### *Gray v. American Radiator*

Lawsuit brought in courts of IL, involves PA and OH. P purchases hot water heater in IL sold by D, a company located in PA. But the company uses components from many places, included from Titan Valve located in OH. So, a valve is manufactured in OH, sent to PA where it is incorporated into water heater, and then sent to IL for sale. Ms. Gray is injured by the water heater. She sues American Radiator which impleads Titan Valve.The IL Supreme Court finds that Titan Valve is indeed suable in IL, ruling jurisdiction is authorized by an interpretation of IL product liability statute and not in violation of due process. Court says this is a foreseeable exercise of jurisdiction, because the product wound up in IL through a predictable chain of transactions ("stream of commerce"). The court infers that this isn’t the only Titan Valve valve ending up in IL, which means Titan Valve is enjoying many of the benefits of IL’s market. Therefore, it is fair that it should respond to lawsuit in IL in order to satisfy the obligations that come along with accessing that market

## Supreme Court Imposes Limits: Purposeful Act Requirement

### Purposeful Act

* Purposeful Availment - An act by which D purposefully avails itself of privilege of conducting activities within a state, thus invoking benefits/protection of its laws
  * Essential to satisfy requirement of contact with state
  * D manifests some intent to specifically do business with market/individuals within a state
  * Boundaries of purposefulness extended to area where D intends to do business
    * "[T]he sale...is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its products in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States" - WWVW
    * Any proliferation outside those boundaries is the result of independent decisions by 3rd party actors
* Forseeability
  * Majority in WWVW hold that it has never, by itself, been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under due process.
  * Interpretation relevant to due process inquiry - Not the mere likelihood a product will make way into a state, but that D's conduct/contacts are such that he should anticipate being "hauled into court" in that state (Volkswagen)
    * This is unclear and may be circular
  * Forseeability, as part of the stream-of-commerce doctrine, was the basis of Brennan's concurrence in *Asahi*. This was rejected both in O'Connor's opinion and later on in *Nicastro*, which asserts actions, not expectations, empower state to exercise jurisdiction
    * *Asahi* - Fairness considerations can be an independent basis for there being no PJ
* Multi-step inquiry following WWVW:
  1. How purposeful is the defendant’s connection to the forum state? Has it sufficiently availed itself?
  1. In the particular facts of the case, do fairness factors point to or away from exercising jurisdiction?
  * The litany of “even-if’s”: even if all these fairness factors point to jurisdiction, the court thinks that due process clause "acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment"

#### *Hanson v. Denckla*

Hanson, Mother living in PA uses DE estate company to set up a trust. She subsequently moves to FL and executes action that gives trust estate to divide it equally among 3 daughters. Two daughters bring action in FL claiming change to trust was invalid. Declaratory judgement affirming validity issued in DE while FL court held it was invalid. Question: is the DE trust administrator suable in FL over a dispute concerning the trust? Court holds FL does not have jurisdiction because the single act of moving to FL was unilateral decision of consumer, not DE trust. DE trust did not execute purposeful availment of FL laws, nor does it satisfy requirement of intentionality and purposeful contacts with the forum.

#### *Worldwide Volkswagen v. Woodson*

D is regional distributor that serves tristate area of NY, NJ, and CT. Seaway is the local dealership in NY. P buys car in NY when living there from the dealership. While driving through OK en route to AZ, Ps were involved in crash. Defect with vehicle results in serious injury. Ps brings suit in OK state court claiming defective gas tank design caused fire. Issue: since car is driven to OK, does that support personal jurisdiction in that state? Court draws on Hanson: we require not just contact between forum and defendant’s activities, but that contact is a purposeful one manifesting intent of defendants to do business specifically with customers or markets in that state. Court acknowledges that if sale arises from the efforts of the manufacturer/distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in a state, then it is not unreasonable to subject it to a suit in that state. However, this was clearly not the case in D's relationship with OK. D's product entering OK was the result of a unilateral act by P. In the absence of that showing of intent/purpose, a key component of jurisdictional showing fails.

#### *Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of CA*

P was injured and his wife killed when they crashed their motorcycle due to a tire blowout. P filed a product liability suit over the defective tire against Taiwanese tire maker in CA state court. Tire maker filed a cross-complaint for indemnification against D. All other claims were dismissed or settled. D moved to quash the summons for lack of PJ. D manufactured valve assemblies in Japan and tire manufacturer bought over 100,000 units annually to incorporate into the tires is sold worldwide CA accounted for 20 percent of tire company's sales in the United States. CA Supreme Court reversed and invalidated writ that CoA had issued TC ordering quashing of the summons. Court applies two-step inquiry: were there purposeful contacts and would exercise of PJ be reasonable under fairness factors identified in *WWVW*? "O'Connor 4" holds that mere knowledge/awareness that product has entered the stream of commerce in forum state is insufficient. There needs to be more: conduct purposefully directed at the forum state and/or showing intent or purpose to serve that market. Exercise of jurisdiction would also fail the reasonable determination, as it is extremely burdensome and the state has little interest. "Brennan 4" argues that if D is fully aware that his product is being sold in CA, then act of placing product within the “stream of commerce” is sufficient contacts for specific jurisdiction because the possibility of lawsuit for a defective product cannot come as a surprise (acceptance of Gray).

### Intentional Torts Context

* Cases involving personal jurisdiction across different contexts (e.g. contracts, intentional torts, etc.) can be viewed as applying a shared set of principles
  * Some paradigms in a specific context might not translate to another context due to differences in the nature of the disputes
  * Products liability is the area where there has been the least consensus
  * However, in the contracts and intentional tort area, there is a consistent series of majority opinions
  * Sometimes court is speaking to specific doctrinal matters, though sometimes these have broader thematic implications that will carry across contexts
* What is distinctive about intentional torts?
  * Generally, allegations in an intentional tort case features D's deliberate contact or connection with P who claims to be injured
  * Contrasted with *Gray*, where manufacturer/dealer had no direct connection with the injured consumer or *WWVW*, where D's connection was only in selling the car
  * However, while intentional contact is standard used to establish PJ in product liability, this might not be sufficient in intentional torts cases
* Effects Test and Express Aiming
  * Contacts with the state have to be purposeful. If you’re **deliberately causing effects within state** of CA, that makes out for a strong case of personal jurisdiction. That’s why *Calder* is sometimes described as articulating an “effects” test.
  * *Calder* is often described as an “express targeting”or “express aiming” case. Writer/editor aimed not just at person in CA, but a person who was involved with the CA industry; the CA industry was a target in a sense because that was the profitable thing to write about.
  * Court expands on this effects test in *Walden v. Fiore*, holding D's suit related conduct must create substantial connection with forum state. It must arise of contacts D himself creates with the state and looks to D's contacts with the forum State itself, not D's contacts with persons who reside there. It held that **the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and forum**. Jurisdiction is based off of D's connections without regard to nature or depth of P's connections to forum state.
* *Griffis* and TV *Azteca* both apply rule that **it’s not enough that you defame someone knowing that they live in the state**

#### *Calder v. Jones*

P lived in CA. D, a national newspaper based in FL, decides to do story about P and her husband. D and its distributor get sued for libel; writer and editor of D also get sued. The two individuals live and work in FL, where D is headquartered and incorporated. Writer travels to CA periodically on business and reporting. For this story he made telephone calls to sources in CA, as well as read the story to P's husband for comments. Editor had been to CA twice, once on vacation and once for an unrelated proceeding. Can P sue not just the newspaper and distributor, who admitted personal jurisdiction existed in CA, but also the writer and editor as individuals? Court rejects 1st amendment defense, as this is accounted for outside the jurisdictional analysis. Court asserts article concerned a CA resident, was drawn from CA sources, impugned P's professional career which was centered in a CA industry, and caused harm (emotional and to professional reputation) the brunt of which was suffered in CA. Court affirms individual Ds' contention that their contacts should not be judged by their employers activities in a state, but this doesn't insulate them from being liable from their individual activities arising out of their employment. Individual D's knew this is state where P lived/worked and where its newspaper had the largest circulation, giving them reason to "anticipate being haled into court there". Thus, court holds jurisdiction over individual D's is proper on this basis.

### Contracts Context

* In the context of contracts with parties domiciled in another state, court considers nature of the obligations, levels of continuous communication, etc.
  * Looks at terms to determine if contracting non-resident has sufficiently "purposefully availed" itself in the privileges provided by a forum state
  * Unfortunately, the activities identified in Burger King doesn't provide us with an idea of the minimum threshold needed for "purposefulness"
* Choice-of-forum clause - Provides that if there is a lawsuit between the parties pursuant to this contract, it will happened in a predetermined forum. This provides jurisdiction in a place where it would otherwise not be authorized, as both parties have consented in advance.
* Choice-of-law clause - Governs the substantive law of a state that a court will use to decide a lawsuit. Effectively determines which state's law of contracts court uses to settle a dispute
* Two-step inquiry in *Burger King*, similar to *WWVW*
  1. Show contacts in state which are purposeful
  1. Consider fairness factors and weigh them against contacts
     * Same factors identified in *WWVW*
     * If the fairness factors are quite strong, then that might justify exercise of personal jurisdiction on slightly less demanding showing of purposeful contacts with state
     * > These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required

#### *Burger King v. Rudzewicz*

P with principal business in FL enter into franchise contract with D for BK restaurant in MI. Contract deals with startup costs and procedures in exchange for right to sell BK products, for a period of 20 years. This contract requires a high level of engagement from both parties on an ongoing basis. After D fails to make royalty payments, P brings suit in FL - contract had choice-of-law clause for FL. D contends that FL court has no PJ of them, as agreeing to choice-of-law clause is sufficient. Court applies minimum contacts test to determine if there was "substantial contact" with forum state and then considers the contacts in light of fairness related factors. Although D had no ties to FL and did not maintain any FL offices, he deliberately negotiated with representatives outside MI and finalized a deal with a corporation he knew was located in FL. Choice-of-law clause reinforces the deliberate affiliation with the state, as D purposefully availed himself of the benefits of FL's laws by entering contract that would be governed by those laws. Thus, court reversed lower court's ruling that PJ had not been established in FL.

## Contemporary Specific Jurisdiction

* Potentially signals paradigm shift in personal jurisdiction back towards those based around sovereign authority.
  * Fairness principles adopted to address issues of the formalistic approach to PJ that allowed corporate defendants to shield themselves from being pulled into court, as demonstrated in *Intl Shoe*
  * Defendant in *Nicastro* operates by similar strategy in the international context. Shields itself from being subject to jurisdiction in any particular state by directing all of its activity at a single distributor
  * Return to the principles of sovereignty in *Nicastro* make this strategy successful and perhaps lays out blueprint for foreign corporations to take advantage of US markets while still shielding itself from any liability

### *J. McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro*

#### Factual Background

NJ resident P became seriously injured while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured in the UK by D. D ships machine to exclusive distributor in OH, which then delivers its products throughout the US.  NJ supreme court found that, even though D never marketed its goods in the state nor shipped them there, NJ courts had jurisdiction over the company because the manufacturer knew or should have reasonably known that its products were distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead their products being sold in any of the 50 states, including New Jersey. D appealed.

#### Kennedy Opinion

Supreme court identifies "purposeful availment" as the governing rule and asserts the "stream-of-commerce" doctrine can't displace it. O'Connor's opinion in *Asahi* stating actions, not expectations, **empower** state to exercise jurisdiction should be the controlling standard. **Personal jurisdiction requires a sovereign-by-sovereign analysis of whether the conduct was directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of the forum so that the sovereign hs the power to to subject D to judgement concerning that act.** Relevant question is one pertaining to the actual intent of D. Where did it intend to submit itself to the power of the state? At no time did D engage in activities in the state of NJ that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. Instead, marketing and sales efforts were directed at the US in general, not to a specific state.

#### Breyer & Alito Concurrence

Needs to be something demonstrating that it would be fair to subject D to PJ based on level of activity and personal availment. The fact that only one machine ended up in NJ is evidence that it would be unfair based, on McIntyre's activity in the NJ market, to make it amenable to suit in NJ. Volume of sales used as a proxy for intent

#### Ginsberg Dissent

Act was in fact purposefully directed - its goal was to see its products sold in as many states as possible with no states excluded. Further, McIntyre UK deliberately took steps to see that products entered different states, namely by retaining a distributor. The plurality seems to be holding that by directing activity at US as a whole, a foreign entity can elude jurisdiction in individual states. It is unfair that P has no recourse in any state. *International Shoe* made clear that the legal fictions of "presence" and "implied consent" should be discarded, though plurality appears to be abandoning fairness principles in favor of a showing of D's intent to submit to authority of the state.

---

## General Jurisdiction

* Describes circumstances where plaintiff asserts personal jurisdiction is obtainable in forum state for any claim because there is something about the nature of D's relationship with that state
  * Can only be satisfied in narrow set of circumstances
  * General jurisdiction determination performs inquiry into state of affairs at the time the action is brought, not the time in which the events on which the claim is based ocurred
* "Doing Business": Follows from the functional equivalent of "presence" that gives state personal jurisdiction over persons under power theory or tag jurisdiction
  * Systematic and continuous commercial activity, in the Pennoyer era, became legal fiction equated to physical presence
  * Post-International Shoe, the idea of general jurisdiction based on level of business activity of corporate defendants carried over under a fairness reasoning. Minimal contacts test, though applied differently than general jurisdiction
  * Likewise, a corporation is legally present and thus subject to general jurisdiction in state(s) where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business (this is still the case today)
  * Helicopteros decision seemed to affirm the availability of this type of general jurisdiction ("doing business") - it was simply the case the activities of the particular defendant weren't enough to constitute "doing business"
  * *Perkins*, which held that exercising PJ over foreign corporation where it carries "systemic and continuous" activities doesn't violate due process, is still good law today
* "At home"
  * Language introduced into the general jurisdiction equation by SCOTUS in *Goodyear*
  * Initially signaled a curtailing on general jurisdiction, but the extent to which was not clear
    * Sustaining a certain level of commerce might no longer lead to general jurisdiction
  * Daimler provides clarification: D has massive corporate presence in CA yet is not held amenable to suit there under theory of general jurisdiction
    * Daimler seems to have rejected altogether the idea of "Starbucks jurisdiction"
    * **General jurisdiction requires a relative inquiry that looks to the defendant corporation’s contacts in the jurisdiction relative to their total contacts**
    * Under general jurisdiction doctrine as understood before, systematic and continuous presence would be met here, but not under standard set forth in Daimler, as it only made up a small fraction of its total global presence
    * Significantly narrows the states where general jurisdiction is available, limits forum shopping, and restricts venue transfers
    * Daimler suggests 20-30-20-30 presence across 4 states would not satisfy the relative analysis in any of the states. It would only be "at-home" in the state of incorporation or HQ
  * Following Daimler, general jurisdiction over corporation can be established by any of the following:
    1. **In the state(s) in which it is incorporated in**
    1. **In its principal place of business (i.e. its nerve center/HQ)**
    1. **If the can be made an extraordinary showing that the corporation is essentially "at home" in the state, relative to its total operations**

### *Helicopteros v. Hall*

Construction project undertaken by Colombian entity in Peru, using some personnel and equipment retained in the state of Texas. Accident occurs on the job site; estates of some deceased worker sought to sue Colombian company in TX on general jurisdiction theory. SCOTUS held there was no personal jurisdiction because level of activity failed to meet the threshold needed for "doing business", as it relates to general jurisdiction. "Mere purchases", even if made at regular intervals, were not enough for general jurisdiction

### Goodyear v. Brown

P parents of children killed in Paris bus accident brought suit in NC over faulty tire. Suit was against foreign subsidiary as well as parent company.
SCOTUS holds general jurisdiction is available where activity essentially renders the defendant "at home"

### *Daimler AG v. Bauman*

P’s bring suit arising out of human rights violations connected to Argentina’s Dirty War that involved Argentine based company. German based parent company is responsible for any liabilities that the Argentine company incurred. Parent company also has US based subsidiary. Suit is brought in CA federal court. Ps argue that (1) US subsidiary is subject to general jurisdiction in CA because of its massive level of contacts there, and (2) whatever contacts US subsidiary has in America are attributable to parent company for purposes of jurisdiction according to an agency theory.Though US subsidiary is not incorporated or HQ’d in CA, it has massive corporate presence there and it comprises its largest market in the US. COURT finds that this isn't sufficient for a finding of general jurisdiction. It asserts need for a "relative inquiry" which looks at contacts/activity in a jurisdiction compared to the totality of its operations. Since CA only made up a small proportion of the parent company's global contacts, court ruled that the activity of the US subsidiary in CA is not enough to establish general jurisdiction over the parent company.

### Bristol-Myers Squibb

Case represents personal jurisdiction in complex litigation (though not a class action). 600 Ps join together to sue BMS in CA over harmful effects of a drug. CA is most plaintiff friendly and also represents that largest pool of individuals among the Ps (86 are residents of CA). No general jurisdiction available here because of Daimler — BMS is not HQ’d or incorporated in CA. **The “arises out of” requirement has to be strictly applied to every plaintiff, no matter how much contact defendant has with forum**.Holding means that you can’t join large number of plaintiffs altogether if they are from (and have been injured in) different states. One option is to sue the defendant in its home state, based on general jurisdiction

# Notice, Venue Rules, and Forum Non Conveniens

## Notice and Service Process

* What is the Constitution trying to protect through Due Process?
  * Accuracy/reliability in application of the law
    * Entitled to a process designed to reach the correct outcome
    * Competing priorities
      * More procedure = more accuracy
      * More procedure = expensive and a barrier to litigation
  * Fairness through an unbiased tribunal through a rule of law
    * "Nation of Laws" and resolution of disputes should be determined by neutral laws
  * Opportunities for voice, protection of the dignity of the individual
    * "The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard". *Grannis v. Ordean*
    * Right to participate in the adjudication. This participation both increases the likelihood of an accurate result but also promotes the litigants' acceptance of adjudication
    * This is a major function of notice - it has little reality or worth unless one in informed that matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default
  * However, as stated above, there are competing considerations - the interests of state and justice system
    * It wants to advance important policies and priorities without being subject to excessively expensive or burdensome demands of highly robust process
    * **Thus, the primary inquiry in due process analysis asks the level of process required constitutionally to guarantee sufficient accuracy, sufficient reliability, sufficiently individualized determination with respect to each litigant, without unduly burdening or compromising interest of state to administer a civil justice system**
* Service of Process - the formal mechanism by which the court attaches its power to the person of the defendant
  * Service of process also performs a notification function by telling the defendant that a lawsuit has been filed against him
  * Due Process concerns - Before a court deprives you of your property, it needs to demonstrate that it has taken adequate steps to inform you of the action and give you an opportunity to participate and make arguments
  * Service of process refers to delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant
  * Summons - a document that has to be signed and executed by seal by clerk of the court. When plaintiff brings lawsuit, she files the complaint with the court and fills out a summons form that gets signed by the clerk.
* Rule 4
  * Is the roadmap for how service of process operates
  * It provides a series of federal procedures for how service of process and notification operate, as well as references to state law
    * Rule 4 explicitly says that federal courts can look to state law in some circumstances to figure out what to do

### Mechanics of Service of Process Under Rule 4

* Who can serve?
  * Any person who as at 18 years or older and is not a party to the suit
  * At P's request, court may order service be made by a U.S. Marshall, deputy, or some other person specially appointed by the court
* How to serve domestic (non-artificial) persons? 2 Categories of approach:
    1. 4(e)(1) - Making use of state process provisions
    1. 4(e)(2) - Federal methods available in all cases
      * In hand delivery to respondent
      * Physical delivery to place of dwelling so long as is left with person of suitable age and discretion
      * Delivery by mail is notably not present in federal provisions. Federal courts view it as less than ideal for confident/reliable delivery
        * Most states typically have a physical mail delivery provision that can be made use of under 4(e)(2)
* How to serve corporations and other artificial entities?
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Make use of state provisions
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Delivery to an agent, authorized either expressly or constructively by the entity, to receive service of process
    * Can't just hand to whomever is at the front desk
* Waiver of Service (Rule 4(d))
  * Instead of using a formal 4(e) method, you can use the waiver process
    * Mail defendant a copy of the complaint and the summons and attach a waiver for the defendant to sign and mail back to the plaintiff
    * Receipt of waiver by court is a substitute to formal service of process
  * What is respondent's incentive to waive?
    * If agree to waiver, then you get more time to respond to the complaint--60 days from when waiver was sent, as opposed to 21 days from an in-person summons
    * Unless respondent has good cause not to waive, will bear cost of declining the waiver (i.e. the expenses claimant incurs in formally serving)
  * Is applicable to both artificial and non-artificial entities
* Time limits for service of process
  * Service must be effectuated within 90 days from filing the complaint, though it can be extended for good cause (e.g. defendant avoiding process)
    * Failure to serve in time can result in the claim being dismissed
      * At best you have to do it again
      * At worst, statute of limitations bars bringing the claim again
        * Relevant statute of limitations (fed/state?) is important
        * Waiver of service => if you go this route, you better know your statute of limitations and make sure it's satisfied
* Serving minors or people with mental impairments
  * 4(g) - state law controls
    * Rationale - serious policy questions here, and states are primarily entrusted with safeguarding the interests of their citizens

* Constitutional standards of notice:
  * Is it a good requirement for court to say that defendant needs to receive \*actual notice\* for due process to be satisfied?
    * Obvious benefit - it guarantees that defendant is actually aware that interests might be compromised
    * Bears on the "opportunity to be heard" component of due process
    * Problem is one of allocation responsibility: How much responsibility must plaintiff take to bring matter to defendant's attention and how much responsibility must defendant exercise to effectively receive the notice?
* *Mullane* addresses question of what procedures for notice are constitutionally required when some parties to a lawsuit are known and identified individuals but others are unknown or could only be identified through enormous effort
  * Answer: Must be a reasonably calculated attempt to inform, the means of which might be employed by someone who is actually seeking to accomplish such notice
    * Reasonably certain to inform those affected or, at the very least, not significantly less likely to bring home notice than other feasible substitutes
  * "Personal service" is not indispensible in all circumstances"
    * People move around, plaintiff might not have defendant’s address, impractical based on number of individuals, it would be very expensive, etc.
    * Might also incentivize strategic avoidance of service and thus litigation cannot occur
* *Mullane* standard applied elsewhere
  * *Greene v. Lindsey* - Eviction notices being posted on doors where public housing authorities knew notices were being ripped off by children. Court held that, based on factual record, this failed to satisfy constitutional requirements
  * *Jones v. Flowers* - Notice sent by certified mail (traditionally viewed as the gold standard for providing notice). Certified mail by nature comes with receipt of successful delivery. Taxing authorities got informed that mail delivery was not successful. They then did nothing. Court found that in this circumstance, certified mail was constitutionally insufficient notice

### *Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.*

Issue in controversy is constitutional sufficiency of notice to beneficiaries on judicial settlement of accounts by trustee of common trust fund. D establishes common trust fund comprised of 113 individual trusts, which effectively pooled the assets of which beneficiaries ratable share. Only notice given to beneficiaries was by publication of local newspaper in compliance with minimum requirements of NY state law. P contends that notice of interests being participant to this investment vehicle (common fund) was insufficient. Due process clause requires (at a minimum) that deprivation of life, liberty, or property by way of adjudication must be proceeded by notice and opportunity for hearing. Court rules the proceeding to establish common fund may deprive beneficiaries in two ways: it may cut off their rights to have trustee answer for impairment of their interests and their interests are subject to diminution by fees/expenses without their knowledge. Court thus asserts **notice must be of such nature to reasonably convey required information and afford a reasonable tim for those interested to make an appearance. However, notice which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it. Reasonableness/constitutional sufficiency can be defended on grounds that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected or, where conditions do not permit such notice, that form chosen isn't less likely to provide notice that substitutes**

## Venue

* Venue, in general
  * Relates to statutory requirement in §1391 that identifies which judicial district you can bring your lawsuit in
  * A separate and distinct requirement and analysis from personal jurisdiction. It is another hoop to jump through in initiating lawsuit
    * Jurisdiction is concerned with "power to adjudicate", while Venue is often distinguished as being concerned with the "convenience of trial"
  * A matter of administrative convenience for the federal courts which district you would bring lawsuit in
    * Also concerned with  the efficient functioning of the federal system
  * It is usually the case if you are able to obtain PJ, you can have venue in the same district court
  * Federal venue operates both *intra-jurisdictionally*, to allocate a case within a multi-district state, as well as *inter-jurisdictionally*, to allocate as case within the nationwide federal judicial system.
* There are two primary mechanisms to satisfy venue according to §1391
  * 1391(b)(1) – Residency Venue
    * Venue is any district the D resides if all D’s reside in the same state
    * Venue amendments provide that a natural person is "deemed to reside" in the judicial district in which that person is domiciled
    * For a corporation or unincorporated entity - anywhere they are subject to personal jurisdiction
    * In multi-district states, a defendant corporation is deemed subject to personal jurisdiction in a district if its contacts with the district would be sufficient to subject it to jurisdiction if the district were a separate state
    * When corporation is plaintiff, then residence is limited to district where it makes its principal place of business
    * In multi-defendant cases, venue is proper in district where \*any\* D resides, if \*all\* Ds reside in the same state
      * In multi-D case where Ds from different states, brining suit in district that is residence of only one of the D's is not proper venue
  * 1391(b)(2) - Substantial Part
    * Venue established where substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim ocurred
    * This is the most relevant venue provision for cases involving multiple Ds from different states
  * 1391(b)(3) – Venue of Last Resort
    * If there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought, venue will be proper in any district in which any D is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action
    * Catch-all – if and only if venue is not established in (b)(1) or (b)(2), venue can be anywhere any D is subject to personal jurisdiction
    * This rarely comes up
* Venue Transfer
  * Option to transfer cases between districts in the federal system, but N/A in state courts
  * §1404 allows transfer of a case from district it was filed to any other district where it could have been brought
    * Exception: if every party involved consents to the transfer
  * If you can show that venue you seek to transfer to do would have been originally available, court has discretion to, in the interest of justice and convenience to parties, to allow the transfer
* §1406 is a tool available for the district court
  * Where plaintiff has filed lawsuit in district where there is no venue, the district court can dismiss the case for lack of venue, or in the interest of justice transfer the suit to another district where it could have been brought
  * This can save plaintiffs new filing fees or the risk of running past the statute of limitations and not being able to file again
  * Choice of law rules travel with the case as it travels across the country (VanDeusen case)
  * Can also happen if no PJ in first district
    * Choice of law, obviously, does not follow here (if it wasn’t proper in the first place…)
* §1407 Multi-district litigation (MDL)
  * Statute that allows the federal courts, via a special panel of judges appointed by the Chief Justice, to take cases from around the country that share common issues of law and fact-related cases, and transfers all of them to be a single district to be administered by one judge for pre-trial purposes
  * Consolidation mechanism that is hallmark of modern complex litigation. Powerful tool that takes similarly related cases from around country and have them heard by single judge

## Forum Non Conveniens

* Forum Non Conveniens, in general
  * A purely judge-made doctrine in the federal courts, an example of federal common law
  * An additional doctrine of discretion that may further restrict a plaintiff's ultimate selection of a forum and provides a defendant with some counter-control over where suit may be brought
  * Judicial discretion to dismiss action otherwise appropriate for lack of convenience in light of an alternative venue, despite the fact that proper jurisdiction and venue requirements were met in the first forum
  * Weight should be given to P’s choice of forum if based on convenience
    * However, where choice appears to be purely strategic, less defence is given to P's choice
  * Factors considered by court in exercising discretion
    * Extent to which lawsuits has major non-US components (proposed alternative venue would not be one eligible for transfer because it is in foreign country)
    * Private factors: convenience, cost, witness availability, enforceability of judgment
    * Public factors: unclear whether nature of claim and law should matter, using juries to interpret challenging law
  * The district court can balance above factors in deciding whether to dismiss the lawsuit
    * The mere fact that dismissal will be bad for plaintiff is not a reason to hesitate to dismiss
    * However, not merely about slight relative differences in convenience. Factors must point significantly in direction of external forum
* D can waive defects to induce P to bring suit in foreign court (e.g. pay expenses, waive SoL) Why would a defendant want a lawsuit outside the US?
  * Less availability of contingency-fee lawyers in other countries if it's even allowed
  * US discovery rules are much more generous and invasive than other countries, even with the newer proportionality standard
  * US juries more generous than in other countries (and other countries don't necessarily have juries for civil cases)
  * US/state law would apply more likely than not, and tort doctrine in the US has more likelihood of recovery for plaintiff
  * Sometimes defendants will make concessions to bring cases in forum that is foreign…very few cases are brought/re-filed
* When the burden falls on parties AND the courts, the court can take that into account when considering is a US court is excessively inconvenient
  * Is there a public interest in seeing this adjudicated locally?
    * Yes, usually if P is domestic or events occurred domestically
    * Doesn’t have to be 100%, but has to be a strong interest
* Unless there’s no remedy at all, courts are reluctant to dismiss FNC solely because P would be disadvantaged by change of law.

### Piper Aircraft v. Reyno

Plane crash in Scotland, D manufacturer in PA and propeller manufacturer in Ohio. Scottish P brings suit in California because of more favorable law. Court ruled that P may not defeat a motion to dismiss on grounds of FNC merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the present forum. Possibility of unfavorable change in law (from US to Scottish law) should not be a substantial factor in a FNC inquiry.

# Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts

## In General

* Subject matter jurisdiction is the authority/power that a federal court has to hear certain cases
* There are two basic “species” of subject matter jurisdiction:
  * “Arising Under”: also known as “federal question” jurisdiction; this is when the claims in a case “arise under” federal oversight. This might occur when a claim comes up because of a federal law or constitutional issue.
  * “Diversity”: diversity jurisdiction is when all the defendants reside in different states from all the plaintiffs (complete diversity). There is also a requirement that the amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Grounded in article 3 of the constitution, which embodies the principle of enumerated powers. T
  * The powers that the federal government has in our federal-state system are supreme. Federal policy supersedes state policy when they clash
  * However, because our federal government is a limited government, the objects it can speak to are limited to what is provided in the Constitution
  * The judicial version of the enumerated powers doctrine is Article 3, which defines the powers of the judiciary. Matter of shaping scope and power of the federal judiciary
* Art III §2: The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority…
  * Controversies where the United States is a party
  * Controversies between two or more States
  * Between a State and citizens of another State
  * Between citizens of different states
  * Etc.
* Statute—there must also be statutory authority that allows courts to hear claims. Courts interpret the statutes narrowly, even though the terms are similar to those in the Constitution
  * 28 U.S.C. §1331. Federal Question: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States
  * 28 U.S.C. §1332. Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs
  * Narrow statutory interpretation prevents the district courts from being overwhelmed
* Unlike PJ analysis which was largely focused on constitutional issues, SMJ analysis mostly involves interpretation of statutes
* Can't simply waive it like a party can submit itself to the authority of a court with personal jurisdiction
* Sua Sponte: on its own motion
  * Courts have responsibility to address SMJ questions on its own (not just on motions raised by litigants)
  * Determination that it does not have SMJ nullifies all litigation

---

## Diversity Jurisdiction

* Diversity Requirements (governed by §1332(a)(1))
  * Complete diversity
  * Amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Citizenship
  * Determining citizenship:
    * Individual - domicility defines citizenship
    * Corporations - Principal place of business (under *Hertz*, the “nerve center”) OR the state of incorporation
    * Partnership - assumes the diversity of its "members" (e.g. MLB in *Rose*)
  * When is citizenship determined?
    * At the time the lawsuit begins (time of filing), not at the time of the events that led to the lawsuit
      * Post-filing move by a party does not defeat diversity
    * Implication: can change citizenship before litigation, but changes in citizenship after a lawsuit has been initiated do not affect diversity
  * What if a suit could be diverse but a party’s citizenship destroys diversity? (e.g. *Rose*)
    * If the suit is in the interest of the federal court, the court can strike the party, especially if it’s fraudulently joined
    * But non-diversity cannot be cured by changing the citizenship of existing parties
    * Example: you can get rid of a law firm from a suit but you can’t fire partners to change the citizenship
  * Expats
    * Expats are citizens of the United States who live abroad; therefore, they do not have citizenship in any of the States
    * If an expat is a party to a suit, diversity is destroyed because they are not domiciliaries of any of the states
    * If an expat is in a partnership, they destroy diversity
    * Armed services/incarcerated persons? Too complicated for this class
* Amount in Controversy
  * The amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000. If the amount is exactly $75k, it does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement
  * Claim Aggregation Rules
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against a given D - aggregation of amount in claims is allowed
      * Each part of the lawsuit must have SMJ
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * Rare exception - when the substantive nature of the claims makes them inseparable
    * When multiple P's have claims against a given D - no aggregation of their claims is allowed
      * However, see class-action rule below
    * When multiple Ps have claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * However, each P can aggregate multiple claims against one of the individual Ds
  * Class-Action Rules of Aggregation
    * When multiple Ps have claims against a given D - aggregation allowed where they are seeking to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common or undivided interest
    * Claims of the class members cannot be aggregated if their rights are “separate” rather than “joint” or “common”
    * One class representative’s claim must exceed $75,000 and the court will have supplemental jurisdiction over the claims that do not exceed $75k
* Alienage Jurisdiction - Extension of federal courts jurisdictions over controversies involving non-citizens
  * Common justifications
    * Mitigate local bias against foreigners by allowing them to remove such cases to federal courts
    * Argument claiming that to compel aliens to litigate in state court would be an affront to the sovereign nations from which they come
  * Alienage jurisdiction provided for in §1332(a). Available in two basic situations and not available in one key situation
    * Available in lawsuit between citizen of state and citizen of a foreign state: NY v. China. Also works: NY v. China + Italy + Nigeria
    * Available where domestic diversity is satisfied, with foreign states added on: NY + Myanmar v. PA + Nigeria
      * Nothing in the statute requires foreign citizens to be diverse from each other, so we could also have NY + Myanmar v. PA + Myanmar
    * What doesn’t work, somewhat counter intuitively, is: China v. Nigeria (Protecting non-citizens from local bias: does not exist for non-citizens vs. non-citizens )
    * Citizens subject to foreign state that is also domiciled in same state as opposing party is another exception under 1332(a)(2)

## Federal Question Jurisdiction

* Jurisdiction based on federal question comprise 70% of cases in federal court
* In the vast majority of federal question cases jurisdiction, there is no difficult question surrounding the presence of federal question jurisdiction under §1331
* A federal court can exercise SMJ whenever a case “arises under” the Constitution or a federal statute
  * Typically, it is unequivocally clear that there is federal arising under jurisdiction
  * State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims based on federal law (plenary SMJ unless federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction)
* "Well-pleaded" Complaint - Standard established in *Mottley*
  * A case arises under federal law only if it appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, even if federal law is likely to be determinative of the controversy
    * Part of the reason *Mottley* court introduced such a restrictive standard was out of concern that grant of federal question matter jurisdiction would overwhelm the courts
  * Shrinking the complaint to its "well-pleaded" essentials would exclude P's anticipation of what D might plead or speculation as to the subsequent course of the suit
  * What aspects of a particular claim can be said to "arise under" federal law
* The “Because Principle” - First articulated in *Smith*
  * *Smith* establishes that there are some cases involving state law claims that implicate federal question jurisdiction
  * "Because" test - federal law question is the centerpiece of the well-pleaded complaint because it explains the cause of action, rather than being an anticipatory claim of D’s defense
  * The federal law issue appears as the object of the “because” in the complaint. The plaintiffs say that you’re investing in these farm loan bonds, violating Missouri law; it’s illegal **because** it exceeded the powers of Congress to create this whole regulatory structure under Article 1
    * This is not an anticipated affirmative defense; it is an explanation of what constitutes the violation of the duty (i.e. the cause of action)
    * Holmes dissent - Federal jurisdiction should depend on whether federal law provides the remedy. Thus, claim resting on state law should not be subject to federal jurisdiction.
* *Merrell Dow* raises questions about the validity of *Smith*
  * Fails to provide clarity regarding when a lack of federal cause of action (if not in all cases) would defeat arising under jurisdiction, even if there is a federal interest in the case
  * Majority in case appears to align itself with Holmes' dissent in *Smith*. Does it overturn the decision?
    * Best way to view this post-Grable is that the conspicuous absence of a federal private right of action is indicative of lack of federal interest
  * Prof. Wolff also suspects that the principle articulated in Grable was part of the courts reasoning, as state negligence per se cases would have a dramatic impact on the federal courts if they could suddenly be heard
* Grable provides clarity
  * Supreme Court says federal court can hear case, and that Smith remains good law. Merrell Dow didn’t mean that no federal cause of action always equals no federal jurisdiction
  * Even if issue is dispositive and there is substantial federal interest, it must be asked if the claim could be entertained without disturbing congressionally approved balance between state and federal courts (i.e. it would lead to an influx of cases in similar class flowing into federal courts)
  * However, in Grable, there appears to be a logical tension between the idea that issue is of substantial federal interest (IRS collection methods) and that it won't also only affect a miniscule number of cases
* Following Grable, we can summarize 4 considerations needed:
  * Well-pleaded complaint (bright line rule)
  * Dispositive federal issue (claim turns upon interpretation of federal law issue)
  * Strong federal interests (implicated by resolution of federal law question)
  * Balance of federal/state responsibilities (The Division of Labor)

### Motley

Couple sues RR, claim arises out of settlement from train crash allowing them to ride for free. RR reneges, claiming federal statute prevents them from renewing the pass. SCOTUS concludes federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction because **"arises under" requires showing cause of action as source of question of constitution, rather than an anticipated defense. The plaintiff's "well pleaded complaint" must state that the defendant directly violated some provision of the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States**.

### Smith

D wants to invest in federal farm loan bonds under a federal act, but P shareholders say it can’t because it would be unconstitutional. Court says suit satisfies well-pleaded complaint rule. Federal interests at stake - would have been a blow to federal regulatory program if institutions couldn't invest. When the **federal law issue is the centerpiece of a case and questions constitutionality of a federal program, court says this makes SMJ appropriate**

### Merrell Dow

Ps from Scotland and Canada suing D, Merrell Dow, in Ohio. Claim related to mislabeling of pharmaceutical products, including violation of Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act. Ps file lawsuit in state court; D strategically removes to federal court on basis of federal question jurisdiction. Once in federal court, D files FNC motion. All parties to suit agree that there was no private cause of action for violation of federal statute (*negligence per se*). However, main issue is whether there is still §1331 jurisdiction. Circuit court applies standard from *Smith* and concludes there is no SMJ, primarily because there were several other theories of negligence in P's claims, thus not a dispositive federal issue. SCOTUS affirms, though reasoning muddies the standard. Essentially says, in the absence of a federal private right of action there is no federal interest, and thus there is no federal jurisdiction. Congressional intent as to whether there should be private remedy for federal law is important

### Grable & Sons v. Darue

Case involving land seizure by state to satisfy P's unpaid tax liability. Property is sold by state to D. P brings suit claiming D does not have proper title to land because seizure was invalid due to failure to provide adequate notice. D removes to federal court. Both district and circuit courts found lack of federal cause of action did not bar exercise of federal jurisdiction. Here, SCOTUS highlights exception to the brightline "well-pleaded complaint" rule used in *Merrell Dow*. Court holds that issue must be dispositive and a substantial federal policy interest as to the resolution of the issue, which is a reaffirmation of considerations found in *Smith*. However, court also asserts that **federal issue wil ultimately qualify for federal forum only if doing so is consistent with congressional judgement about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts under §1331**. Thus, there must always be an assessment of any potential disruptions in exercising federal jurisdiction. Court does not want, without clear indication of congress, a shift in the balance that would open up the floodgates and offset the intended balance in this division.

## Pendent, Ancillary and Supplemental Jurisdiction

* Whether the limited subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts precludes authority over additional claims between P and D or over 3rd parties that, standing alone, couldn’t be asserted in such tribunals
  * Practically, there will be complicated lawsuits, and for convenience, you’ll want to try them all at once
* Under Article III, court reads “cases and controversies” as very expansive: encompasses all parts of a lawsuit that fit together and from the same “controversy” even if there are separate claims
  * Statutory power not present federal common law grounded in Article III interpretation
  * There is no statutory provision for hearing non-diverse state claims in federal courts
  * Major question is how Article III treats these "mixed" claim cases
    * Basic answer in *Gibbs* - Since judicial power extends to "cases and controversies", and we have federal anchor claim, court can adjudicate similar state claims so closely related to anchor as to be part of same case/controversy
* When there is a jurisdictional challenge, you have to be prepared to account for every element of the litigation
  * Joinder - the way in which one is permitted to "put the lego pieces together" in a particular way in constructing a lawsuit. Are you allowed to put case together through the tools of the joinder rules?
  * Jurisdiction: there must be a claim that has original subject matter jurisdiction
  * Even if it makes convenient sense and meets joinder rules, SMJ may be lacking in some claim
* Two tests  for whether two claims are party of the same case or controversies
  1. Common Nucleus of operative facts - *Gibbs*
     * Invites an inquiry into the facts that comprise each of the claims in the mixed lawsuit
     * Asks about the facts underlying the two claims and whether the facts that overlap are: core, insofar as they are central to the claim as opposed to existing in the periphery; and operative, insofar as their resolution drives the outcome of the lawsuit, as opposed to atmospheric facts
       * An easier way to think about this is if the various claims are such that they would ordinarily be expected to be tried in a single judicial proceeding
     * If this test is satisfied, state claims in a mixed case are sufficiently related to anchor claims so as to be part of the same "controversy" in Article III, thus entirety of claims comprises one constitutional case
     * Importance of common nucleus of operative fact standard
       * Efficiency, constitutional authority, fairness
     * Still a matter of discretion as to whether court actually accepts case for adjudication. Discretionary factors include:
       * If anchor claim gets dismissed fairly early in lawsuit; if supplemental claims require court to decide complex or novel issues of state law; if state law claims predominate over federal law claims; exceptional circumstances
  1. Logical Relationship Test - *Moore*
     * Moore allows supplemental jurisdiction because there is a “logical relation” between the claims
     * Can be better understood as a matter of dependence
       * Whatever factual overlap exists, if the resolution of supplemental claim relies on the resolution of the anchor claim, then they can be heard under the same controversy
       * In order to decide the one claim, as a practical reality, we have to decide the other as well
* Additional Parties - *Kroger* and *Finley*
  * Statutory authorization - have it for general federal question jurisdiction, but what about supplemental?
    * Did not exist at time of *Gibbs* and *Kroger*
    * *Gibbs* ignored this, but *Kroger* recognized this and held that allowing exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in the case would have presented a statutory problem
      * Court does not want to permit parties to do indirectly that which has been "barred" by statute when done directly
      * "Barred", more specifically, can be understood as conflicting with congressionally approved jurisdictional policy
  * Finley was the impetus for 28 USC §1367
    * (a) - Affirmative authorization of supplemental jurisdiction to the limits of Article III §2 ("same case or controversy") except:
      * Other federal statute
      * (b) or (c)
    * (b) - Only applies where anchor claim based solely on diversity
      * No supplemental jurisdiction over claims by P against against persons joined under:
        * Rule 14 - Impleader Rule
        * Rule 19 - Necessary Party Rule
        * Rule 20 - Ordinary Joinder Rule
          * Glitch - Only applies to parties joined by P. This may allow one of multiple Ps to circumvent amount in controversy requirements
        * Rule 24 - Provision for Intervention
      * Counterclaims under Rule 13 are not excluded from supplemental jurisdiction when anchor claim is based on diversity
      * No supplemental jurisdiction over claims by persons joined under:
        * Rule 19 - Necessary Party Rule
        * Rule 24 - Provision for Intervention
    * (c) Discretionary Factors
      * Codifies discretionary factors in goods which may be good reason not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction

### *United Mine Workers v. Gibbs*

P unable to fulfill obligations in employment contract due to actions by D. He filed suit against D based on their violation of a federal statute (Labor Management Relations Act) and the claim in controversy is a state-law claim allegedly part of an unlawful conspiracy to “maliciously, wantonly and willfully” interfere with his contracts. Court says it makes sense to bring claims together in a single lawsuit; it would have been unfair to bring this claim in state court. Where there is a lawsuit involving claim with independent basis for federal SMJ, article 3 allows that any claims closely related to this "anchor claim" be litigated together as a matter of common sense. To determine this, court employs test which requires the **state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative facts**

### Moore v. NY Cotton Exchange

P brings federal anti-trust claim against D, D brings state counter-claim (Joinder Rule 13) alleging P stole pricing information which it used as the basis of its anti-trust accusations. Federal claim was dismissed on the merits, not for lack of jurisdiction. On the state-claim, court rules that if one party asserts federal anchor claim, and other party counter-claims with a state-law claim, the **court can exercise its discretion to hear the additional claim if the counter-claim arises from the same transaction or series of transactions such that they bear a logical relationship to one another**, even if the anchor claim is dismissed (unless dismissed for jurisdictional issues)

### Owen Equipment v. Kroger

P filed wrongful death action in federal court on diversity. D1 impleaded 3rd party (Rule 14), and P amends complaint to add impleaded D2 as new party. Original D1 got his case dismissed, so the only remaining parties were P v. D2 (with no diversity). Court holds that there is no supplemental jurisdiction; there is no complete diversity which **conflicts with express authority of 1332**. Additionally, no efficiency in jurisdictional exercise of a suit with only non-diverse parties when the proper forum is state court. Hypothetically, if D1 remained as defendant and impleaded D2, court might not strike down since it is defendant who is trying to get both claims heard in one court (would otherwise be inconvenience) and its not incompatible with 1332

### *Finley v. United States*

P was wife and mother of victims of a plane crash. She sued the FAA, which can only be sued in federal courts, as well as local entities (city of San Diego and SD Gas & Electric) with state claims. SCOTUS held that federal court lacked authority to assert jurisdiction over the state claims against the non-federal defendants. She would need to bring two separate suits. In doing this, SCOTUS was effectively inviting congress to act and provide express authorization

## Removal

* Right to Removal under §1441
  * Tool for D’s to remove case to federal court if it would have had original jurisdiction anyway, grounded in either §1331, §1332, or §1367
  * Challenge removal by motion to remand. Case not dismissed, simply sent back to state court
  * Where multiple Ds, all parties must consent to removal
  * Parties have 30 days to file motion to remand if grounds for challenging are something other than subject matter jurisdiction
  * Filing for removal on diversity grounds requires D satisfy plausibility standard in establishing scope of the damages meets amount in controversy requirements
    * May conflict with D's own interests, as he is basically setting the floor on damages that can be assessed against him at $75,000
  * Only Ds can remove. Ps are not allowed to remove, even if the D does something that leads the P to have a good reason to be in federal court
  * Resident defendants do not have power to remove if sued in their state of residency
  * The removal motion needs a short and plain statement for basis of removal. Notice of removal has to spell out the basis for removal
  * If court issues order to remand, this decision is not reviewable with 2 exceptions:
    1. Court asserts reason for denying is something other than improper removal (i.e. too busy) - Can appeal via extraordinary writs in these cases
    1. Remands under discretionary provision of supplemental jurisdiction

# The Law Applied in Federal Courts and the Erie Doctrine

## Overview of Erie Doctrine

* Fundamental question - which law applies when a federal court is sitting in diversity, federal or state?
  * The scope of this section is limited to federal diversity cases
  * When is state law going to control, not just the substantive law, but also the procedural law in a federal court?
  * *Erie*'s ultimate response can effectively be reduced to the following:
    * Substantive rules of decision (regulatory policy, tort low, contract law, etc.) governed by state law, and procedural law governed by federal law with narrow exceptions
* Two questions requiring focused analysis in Erie Doctrine
  1. First question - What do the federal rules and statutes actually address? What do and don't they govern?
  1. Second question addressed by Erie Doctrine relates to "judicial law-making"
     * It matters whether procedural source is statutory or judge made (e.g. forum non conveniens)
     * It will often be the case that federal court will adopt state law, rather than applying federal procedural doctrine
     * Procedural law (e.g. rules governing litigation, available remedies, etc.) is all embodied in FRCP and other federal statutes, so federal courts, almost without exceptions, will apply this law
* Two legal texts provide starting point for identifying the law that should be applied in federal courts:
  1. Constitution
     * 10th Amendment - “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
     * Article III - Delineates the powers specifically assigned to the federal courts
       * The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish
       * Judicial power includes the authority to resolve certain kinds of cases and controversies including those arising under federal law and cases between citizens of different states
  1. Rules of Decision Act (Judiciary Act of 1789)
     * The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply
     * Concerns about circularity?

## Pre-Erie

* Swift Decision
  * Court holds that in federal diversity cases purely confined to application of judicial made common law, as opposed to claims under statute, federal court is not bound to state common law and had freedom to exercise independent determination of the "best law"
    * Justice Story - Judicial decisions are not laws themselves, but evidence of what the laws are. This reflects his vision of law:
      * His interpretation of the "law of several states" from the Rules Decision Act was of a body of shared principles from which the states draw on, not the individual law of each state
      * When state courts issue common law decisions, they do not "make" law, rather they issue their interpretation of the "existing" common law
    * Justice Story's envisioned a uniform body of commercial law that would bring predictability to commercial disputes in a way that would promote economic efficiency and facilitate the growth of U.S. industry
* Leading up to *Erie*, federal courts sitting on diversity were relying on general federal common law as opposed to that of the individual states
* At the same time, however, procedure in federal courts had been mostly guided by state law
  * 1792 Process Act and 1872 Conformity Act both say that questions of practice and procedure in federal courts are governed by the procedures that would apply in state procedure in state court
* Problems with Swift
  * Created incentives for forum shopping
    * “Discrimination by non-citizens against citizens” because P can choose the court and could use diversity jurisdiction as a way to get a more favorable outcome

## Erie Decision

* 2 monumental events in 1930's radically changes federal courts:
  1. 1934 rules enabling act enables SCOTUS to promulgate uniform procedural rules, which culminates in the drafting and adoption of the FRCP
     * Shift from reliance on state procedures
  2. Swift is overturned in Erie decision, as SCOTUS rules "laws of the several states" as articulated in the Rules Decision Act extends to common law rules
     * State common law is more than interpretation of shared principles, but distinct substantive state law
     * Anytime you are presented with the question about the content of a cause of action in a diversity case (what you might label a “substantive” law question about regulatory or liability issues), use state law
* What does the decision in *Erie* mean?
  * Suggests view of what law is has evolved (philosophically)
    * Trending towards legal positivist approach - There needs to be legitimate and identifiable sovereign authority in order for law to be binding
  * Suggests that for the last 130 years, federal courts may have been articulating a law that congress itself would have no authority to enact due to constitutional constraints
    * This is an issue of federalism - Congress, under powers enumerated in the constitution, could not enact a uniform tort law or contract law if it wanted to. That is effectively what the federal judiciary was doing pre-*Erie*
  * Puts to rest the idea of a general federal common law. Federal courts are not purpose common law courts (though state courts are)
    * Decision stands for the proposition that state courts are the expositors of the contents of state law
  * Can be viewed as an attempt to correct the issues and perverse incentives created by *Swift*
    * All but eliminates forum shopping opportunities if the same law is being applied regardless of whether case is heard in a federal or state court
      * Not clear whether *Erie* created greater parity in the long run. **It may have actually increased forum shopping opportunities**
      * Pre-*Erie*, there was great deal of uniformity in choice of law doctrine among states, meaning Ps had little incentive when selecting forums since same state law would likely apply anyways
      * Uniformity eroded following *Erie*, though the extent of this is not made clear in the notes, nor is *Erie*'s role in the undoing
      * At a time where *Intl Shoe* expanded the states where a D could be held amenable to suit, this gave P more forum shopping opportunities
    * Unequal protection problem: diverse or non-diverse parties in a similar lawsuit could lead to different results
      * Seems unfair to defendant that they will win or lose depending on which court they get sued in
      * However, casebook notes indicates the displacement of state law didn't really give disproportionate power to either party. The only situation where P completely controls where case is heard is when P brings suit in the state in which D is a resident. This prevents removal, effectively permitting P to vertically forum shop (i.e. select the more desirable of state and federal law). Erie undoubtedly helped D in these situations
    * Also an element of uncertainty created by *Swift* which affected how parties in a state regulated their conduct
      * If there were different standards for liability between state and federal court, then how should actors in a state conduct itself to avoid liability? Applicable law is impossible without prior knowledge of opposing party citizenship
* Challenges with *Erie*
  * The tricky part is understanding how this principle works in cases involving judge-made “procedural” law. In light of the Rules of Decision Act (laws of several states shall govern in federal court), and background constitutional context of federal courts as courts of limited jurisdiction, how does this set of principles work when it comes to procedural questions?
    * Courts forced to figure out how to deal with "hazy" distinction between substantive and procedural law, as well as what to do when state and federal procedural law conflict
  * Erie discussed federalism issues and issues about equal protection, both constitutional issues. Post-*Erie* court struggled in subsequent decades to figure out how much of *Erie* decision was a constitutional doctrine vs a matter of policy within federal courts related to procedural questions
    * If the Federal/State procedural distinction is indeed a matter of constitutional law, then it doesn't matter whether the source of the federal law is judicially made or a statute because it can't violate the constitution

### *Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins*

P was injured while walking alongside the train tracks of D. Trespassing is contributory negligence in state of PA, though P argues it should be tried as a matter of general la in federal courts. **Court rules that except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.**. Diversity federal cases cannot create common law at the expense of state sovereignty. Federal system has enumerated powers, with all other powers reserved to the states. Thus, *Swift* approach is unconstitutional.

## Post-Erie

* Some additional consideration regarding the nature of the federal judiciary
  * If source of procedural law is some legislative body (e.g. congress), then it is the obligation of federal courts to administer these policies unless there are constitutional conflicts
  * Federal court has authority to create own procedural law by virtue of being its own independent court system
    * TBW - "It is just part of being a functioning court system"
  * Rules Enabling Act
    * Delegates authority to SCOTUS to promulgate rules related to procedure, evidence, etc. Ultimately culminates with the adoption of the FRCP
    * Prior to clarification in *Hanna*, was unclear the extent to which FRCP could override state procedural law
* Outcome Determination and *Guaranty Trust*
  * Immaterial whether question is characterized as substantive or procedural. Putting this terminology aside, what is relevant to this problem is whether the question would would lead to a substantially different result when federal law is applied
  * Its concern is with federal jurisdictional policy (diversity) approved by congress
    * Congresses intent with diversity statute was not to provide litigants with separate body of law
    * "The operation of a double system of conflicting laws in the same State is plainly hostile to the reign of law"
    * Forum shopping incentives that would be created is relevant here
      * Whether federal policy might create perverse incentives for litigants should factor in as considerations
  * To avoid incompatibility with this policy, state doctrine should prevail where there would be substantially different results
* State v. Federal Interests - *Byrd*
  * Acknowledge post-*Erie* policy of conforming to state rules where there is a divergence in outcomes between federal and state procedures
  * However, it asserts there are countervailing affirmative considerations that may disrupt essential characteristics or functions of the federal court system
    * These may counterbalance or supersede other factors that may create incentives to forum shop and which led court to apply state rules in *Guaranty Trust*
* *Hanna* clarifies the potential constitutional questions created by *Erie*
  * Answer: these situations don’t typically present constitutional problems. When it comes to procedural questions, what’s at stake is fundamentally a matter of statutory or rule-based policy
    * If procedural question is governed by a statute, that means authoritative body has spoken on issue and thus it should be followed
      * There has been an authoritative legislative pronouncement, thus it is fine if there is deviation from state law because legislative body intended to do so
      * No need to balance/resolve competing considerations - legislative body has (presumably) already done so. If federal lawmakers want to create forum shopping incentives, they are free to do so
    * However, where authority is judicially constructed procedural law, these policies must be balanced out against competing priorities
      * *Hanna* describes these priorities as the "twin aims" of *Erie*
      * Twin Aims of *Erie*
        1. Eliminating improper forum shopping incentives - those not related to convenience or protection from bias, but to obtain a more favorable outcome
        1. Preventing inequitable administration of laws - encompasses, among other things, the first aim
      * Twin aims must be present prior to filing where litigants are selecting forum based on modified outcome-determinative test

### Two-Track Analysis

* **Fundamental Question**: What law should apply in federal diversity court?
  * Substantive law is state law, with exceptions in matters governed by congress or the constitution (*Erie*)
  * Judicially-made federal procedure must be measured against statutory command of diversity (Track 1)
  * Federal procedure, if source is statute or FRCP, controls (Track 2)
* **Track 1: Pure Erie**
  * If rule is federal judge-made procedural law, not a rule or statute, conflicting with state law
    * What is the divergence/policy behind state procedural law?
    * Twin aims of Erie: Does federal rule encourage forum shopping or lead to inequitable administration of laws?
    * Affirmative countervailing considerations
* **Track 2: REA**
  * If federal rule is a statute or FRCP, federal procedural law applies to the question
  * Does rule/statute apply to this issue?
    * Is it broad enough to cover the issue at hand?
    * Does it occupy the field against the state statute? (Direct collision)
  * Does allowing it apply fall within grants of authority in REA and the Constitution?
    * 2702(a): must be rules of practice, procedure and evidence
    * 2702(b): cannot abridge, modify, or enlarge any substantive rights

### *Guaranty Trust v. York*

Deals with the doctrine of laches, which is judge-made law. This would allow P to get around SoL in federal court. SCOTUS reaffirms part of *Erie* doctrine in acknowledging that federal court system is not precluded from applying own judicially created procedural rules. However, question court asks is **whether such application would lead to a significantly different outcome than would applying state procedural law**. Congress created diversity jurisdiction in order to give diverse litigants access to federal courts to get over regional or state bias, not to provide them with another body of law. Thus, **should apply state law where such policy conflicts exist**.

### *Byrd v. Blue Ridge*

P sued D in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for injury sustained working as contractor. D contends that P categorized as "statutory employee" which would bar P's claim under state workman's comp law. Case was remanded and major issue is whether factual determination should be made by jury or judge. Here, majority rules that **state rule cannot disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between judge and jury, an essential characteristic of the federal courts and which is rooted in the 7th Amendment** (which is N/A to state courts). **Where state law would interfere with essential characteristic of federal court, concerns about overstepping may be outweighed by interest in applying federal law**. Thus, court holds that state rule should not be followed
