# Evidence

## Overview

### Common Evidence-Related Terminology

* **Admissibility** - whether evidence is permitted to be presented before a trier of fact for them to consider while deciding the case
  * Rules of evidence determine what types of evidence is admissible, and the judge applies these rules to the case
* **Circumstantial** - Type of evidence that tends to indirectly prove a factual proposition through inference from collateral facts; can be contrasted with direct evidence (e.g., surveillance camera footage of the crime)
* **Competency** - applies mostly to witness testimony; refers to one's ability/qualification to testify as a witness. Note: this competency is not the same as credibility; the former, decided by judge (rather than fact finder), determines whether individual is allowed to testify in the first place, whereas credibility is ultimately a matter decided by jury
* **Materiality** - offered for the purpose of directly proving a specific fact/matter at issue (e.g., a fact proving/disproving a necessary element of the claim/offense)
  * Conversely, evidence offered for any other purpose (evidence which does not stand to have a probative effect on the facts at issue) is said to be immaterial
  * The term is less common in modern law of evidence, but still utilized in some jurisdictions
* **Probativeness or Probative Value** - the extent to which a piece of evidence makes the disputed fact more or less probable or true
* **Relevancy** -  having any tendency to make the facts at issue more or less probably than if this evidence were excluded entirely (i.e., having probative effect)
  * Relevance is a necessary condition for evidence to be admissible; must meet minimum threshold of relevance to be admissible
  * This threshold is not strict: the extent to which evidence tends to affect probabilities does not need to be significant, it just needs to affect it all
* **Sufficiency** - has to deal with meeting burden of production and establishing prima facie case; evidence is "sufficient" when there is enough of it has been produced to move forward to be considered by fact-finder.
  * Difference between this and relevance is that the former is minimum threshold for a piece of evidence to be admissible; for a piece of evidence to be relevant, it does not need prove an element of the claim/offense by itself;
    * Relevance is more of an attribute of individual pieces of evidence, where as sufficiency is an attribute of the entire body of evidence
* **Weight** - The degree to which evidence convinces a fact-finder, based on its credibility/believability, to either accept or reject a factual assertion
  * Weight can be used to describe the strength/credibility of the whole body of evidence in favor of one side of the question of fact
  * Can also describe the strength/credibility of an individual piece of evidence and its contribution to persuading the jury in a certain direction (i.e., how much it moves the needle)
  * Whereas admissibility determined by a judge, weight is ultimately determined by fact-finder (e.g., jury) in credible they find a piece/body of evidence and thus how much reliance to place on it when deciding a question of fact

### Federal Rules of Evidence and Their Applicability

* The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) are applicable to all civil and criminal trial proceedings before U.S. Federal courts (regardless if bench trial or jury trial)
* The FRE **do not apply to**:
  * Trials in state courts
    * Note: The FRE also functions as a de facto set of model rules that have been adopted in a majority of states, thus most states trials are governed by evidence rules very similar to the FRE
  * Non-trial criminal proceedings (e.g., grand jury, discovery, sentencing or probation hearings, issuance of warrants)
    * Exception: the rules in the FRE relating to Privilege apply here as well
  * Courtâ€™s determination of a preliminary question of fact (e.g., admissability/competency of evidence and witnesses)
    * Exception: the rules in the FRE relating to Privilege also continue to apply here

* In federal diversity cases, Fed courts generally apply the FRE in deciding/resolving evidentiary issues that arise during trial

## Burdens of Proof and Presumptions

* The burden of proof consists of two separate burdens: the burden of producing the evidence and the burden of persuasion
  * In a trial, one party is initially presumed to be correct, while the other side bears the burden of producing evidence persuasive enough to establish the truth of facts needed to satisfy all the required legal elements of the dispute

### Burden of Producing the Evidence

* First, there is the burden of production, also known as the "burden of going forward", which is the obligation to produce enough evidence to establish a prima facie case.
  * To meet this burden, one must produce enough evidence as to each element of a claim or defense, such that a reasonable fact finder could infer, on its face (i.e., without opportunity for rebuttal) that what is alleged has been proven
    * This is a question of law, not fact
* In other words, satisfying this burden means a party has produced to evidence on an issue to have it decided by a fact-finder ("going forward") who it must then persuade, to the extent required by the standard of proof, that issue is true
  * Failure to meet this burden likely results in summary judgement or directed verdict/JMOL

### Burden of Persuasion

* Burden of persuasion, also commonly referred to as the standard of proof, is a certain required degree/level of proof with which one must establish a particular issue.
  * Determination of whether burden has been met is the responsibility of the trier of fact
* The standard of proof is different between civil and criminal matters
  * Civil case = preponderance of the evidence
    * Simply put, this standard requires showing the fact is "more probable than not"
    * Exception: there are certain matters (mostly equity suits e.g., custody, wills, fraud) that use a heightened "clear and convincing evidence" standard, which is somewhere between "preponderance of the evidence," and "beyond reasonable doubt" (must be highly probable/reasonably certain)
  * Criminal case =  beyond a reasonable doubt (w/r/t/ each element)
    * Note: for D raising affirmative defenses, must only meet preponderance of the evidence
* This burden does not shift during a trial; it stays with the party to whom the law allocates it by default
  * Example: the prosecution establishing a fact that tends to prove an element of a crime does not shift the burden to the defendant to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, the burden stays with the prosecution and the defendant must merely raise enough doubt so as to prevent that burden from being met
  * The burden of producing evidence, however, may shift throughout the trial
    * For example, if one party makes a prima facie case, opposing party then faces burden of producing counter-evidence
  * Multiple burdens of persuasion may exist in one case (e.g., one for establishing elements of the claim/offense, one for asserting an affirmative defense)

### Presumptions

* **Presumption** - A an inference that must be made, as a matter of law, in light of certain ("basic") facts
  * These basic facts, once established by force of evidence, are what necessitate the legal presumptions
* Most presumptions are **rebuttable presumptions**, meaning evidence can be introduced to defeat them (aka "bursting the bubble")
  * Can do so by challenging the existence of either the "basic facts" (those giving rise to the presumption) or the presumption itself
  * A rebuttable presumption shifts the burden of production, but not the burden of persuasion, to the opposing party
    * The FRE and a majority of states treat rebuttable presumptions as having a procedural effect, meaning the presumption merely shifts the burden of production to the opposing party and "vanishes" entirely if that party produces sufficient evidence supporting facts contrary to the presumption (hence the phrase "bursting the bubble")
* There are also **conclusive presumptions**, also referred to as irrebuttable presumptions, which are those that cannot be directly overcome by introducing counter-evidence against the presumption; once a "basic fact" is established, presumption is conclusive
  * Unlike rebuttable presumptions, which are treated as procedural devices, conclusive presumptions are treated as rules of substantive law (stating that legally X = Y, therefore if X then Y);
  * However, can still offer counter-evidence challenging the "basic fact"
* Although, as noted in the first section, FRE usually governs evidentiary issues in Federal diversity cases, Rule 302 of the FRE also states that "state law governs the effect of a presumption regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision"
  * Thus, when there are questions about presumptions/burdens of proof w/r/t a element needed to establish a state law claim/defense, state law, rather than the FRE, controls the effect of said presumption
  * This upholds the *Erie doctrine*, which states that there is no general federal common law, thus Federal courts must apply state substantive law in suits between citizens of different states

## Relevance

* As explained in the first section of this outline the *relevance** of evidence is a necessary condition for admissibility and can be defined as having tendency of to make the facts at issue more or less probable (i.e., having probative effect)
  * The minimum threshold of relevance that mus be met for evidence to be admissible is not that strict hover; simply needs to have some probative value
  * Trial judge is responsible for applying this relevance analysis by reviewing piece of evidence and determining its probative value (if any);
* Even if a piece of evidence meets this relevance threshold, it may be inadmissible on one of the other grounds for exclusion
  * FRE 403 provides that even relevant evidence may be excluded if its **probative value is substantially outweighed by** the danger of:
    * Unfair prejudice
    * Confusion of issues
    * Misleading the jury
    * Undue delay
    * Waste of time
    * Needlessly presenting cumulative evidence
  * The term "substantially" in FRE 403 is important; even where the aforementioned risks outweigh the probative value of evidence, it may still be admissible if the extent to which it is outweighed is less than substantial
* Conditional admission - There may be circumstances where the question of relevance hinges on the existence of some other fact, which must first be proven before relevance can be determined
  * In these cases, court may admit the evidence so long as conditional fact can be proven later on when it considers the sufficiency of the whole body of evidence
  * At this sufficiency stage, court considers whether jury could reasonably find (by preponderance of the evidence) the conditional fact to be true
* Finally, if a party believes a pieces of admitted evidence is improper, it may, subject to the court's discretion, to admit otherwise inadmissible evidence in order to show this

### Character Evidence

* **Character evidence**, which is generalized information about a personâ€™s personality, traits, ethics, temperament, etc. It can be contrasted with similar, albeit different
  * This is different than habit evidence, which is intended to show that a person repeatedly acts a certain way under specific circumstances or in response to specific stimuli
  * Also distinct from evidence of business routine or industry custom/practice, which intend to show something very similar to habit evidence but w/r/t businesses/organizations
* **General Rule**: character evidence NOT admissible to prove one's conduct at a particular time/place was consistent with their character
  * FRE 404(a)(1) - "Evidence of a personâ€™s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait."
  * Applies both to criminal and civil cases, although tends to arise more in criminal
    * Example: Prosecution not able to admit evidence attempting to show some aspect of D's character, such as misogynistic attitudes/views expressed in the past, to prove D is highly predisposed to domestic violence and is therefore likely to have committed the crime on trial.
  * Reasoning: risks creating unfair prejudice/bias and impair a jury's ability to consider the fact at issue objectively; this is the case even though this character evidence may have some probative value
* **Exceptions** - character evidence not always excluded, either because it is deemed to fall outside the general rule or falls within one of a few explicit exceptions to the rule
  * Character evidence is admissible when **character itself is an essential element** of a claim/defense, rather than as a way to prove one's conduct
    * In these cases, such evidence is not subject to the general prohibition at all
    * One place where this can apply is defamation cases; can also be applicable in child-custody matters
  * **Evidence of D's good character** may be admissible to show that the thing he is accused of is inconsistent with his character, but only if this evidence **pertinent to the crime**
    * However, this then **opens the door for P** to rebut it by introducing evidence of D's bad character (which would otherwise be inadmissible)
  * **Evidence of victim's character** introduced by D may be admissible to show their innocence
    * However, under FRE 402(a)(2)(B) doing this both:
      * **Allows P to counter with rebuttal evidence** showing V's good character; and
      * **Opens the door for P** to introduce evidence showing that the "bad character" D attacks V on is actually true of D himself  
    * FRE 402(a)(2)(C) allows P to introduce evidence of V's peaceful/non-violent character in homicide cases where D claims self-defense and that V was instigator/initial aggression, even if V's character not directly attacked
    * Example: D in assault may be admit evidence of V's violent/aggressive character to show he was attacked first and only acted in self defense; however P may then respond by introducing evidence of V's non-violent character and/or evidence of D's own violent/aggressive character
  * **Evidence of witnesses' character**, specifically as it relates to their truthfulness, may be admissible for the purpose of impeaching a witness.
    * However, this also applies when D will testify in trial and is thus the witness.
* **Types of character evidence** - In the exceptions mentioned above in which character evidence may be permissible, this proof of character generally must take the following forms:
  * **Reputation testimony** - a defendantâ€™s reputation is not the opinion of specific person but of a specific "community", which includes people with whom the defendant engages on a regular basis (not necessarily limited to residential community)
  * **Opinion testimony** - character witnesses personal opinion of some aspect of subject's character
    * Traditionally, character witnesses were limited exclusively to offering reputation (as opposed to witnesses' individual opinion). However, has become more permissive towards opinion testimony
  * **Specific Acts** - see following section for more, but general rule is:
    * Inquiry into specific instances of past conduct usually only allowed on cross-examination of witnesses (usually in attempt to discredit their knowledge)
    * However, when person's character is at issue (essential element of a charge/claim), relevant specific instances of the personâ€™s conduct are admissible and thus inquired into on direct examination of character witness

### Evidence Specific Acts

* In addition to general character evidence (i.e., those based on perceptions of others like opinion or reputation), FRE 404(b)(1) states that evidence of a specific act is not admissible to prove a personâ€™s character in order to show that the person acted in accordance with that character on a particular occasion
  * Same justification as prohibition of character evidence in general: it can lead to unfair prejudice and distract/impair jury. Rather than weigh evidence objectively, jury might rely on inferences drawn about persons character or propensity to act a certain way.
* **Exceptions** - like with evidence of character in general, some instances where evidence of specific past acts may be admissible
  * May be admissible to show something other than propensity to act a certain way. The purposes for which specific act evidence may be admitted are captured (albeit non-exhaustively) by the acronym "**MIMIC**" (FRE 404(b)(2))
    * M - Motive: past bad act establishes motive for the one on trial
    * I - Intent: where knowledge/intent is required element and past bad act helps establish it; this is also relevant in civil cases where knowledge of a defect or condition is a required element of the claim
    * M - Mistake: where past bad act dispels D's claim that his act was accidental or a mistake
    * I - Identity: where identity of the perpetrator is disputed, evidence of past crimes connecting defendant to current one (e.g., the wet bandits from Home Alone)
    * C - Common plan - Common scheme or plan between two or more crimes where proof of one tends to establish the other
  * Note: this evidence still subject to other relevance limitations; may still be excluded if risk of prejudice outweighs probative value
  * Criminal D may request that P provide advance notice of intent to use past crimes or bad acts as evidence before trial; if notice is requested and P fails, evidence may be inadmissible (unless excused by court for good cause)
* Distinguishable from habit evidence and business custom/routine
  * Unlike specific prior acts, habit evidence attempts to show that conduct occurs with such regularity under certain circumstances that they are effectively automatic or reflexive;
    * Must show evidence that this habit both exists with a certain level of inflexibility/invariability (i.e., always instead of often) **and** that the circumstances triggering the habit were present

### Special Exceptions in Sexual Assault and Molestation Cases

* Sexual assault and molestation cases are tricky and involve a number of special exception to the rules governing admissibility of character evidence and specific acts
* Exception to the rule allowing character evidence intended to attack V's character
  * Evidence offered by D intended to prove V's promiscuity/predisposition towards consensual sex or that V engaged in other sexual behavior is generally inadmissible under FRE 412.
    * Why? Possibility of V's sexual past being revealed in trial may deter V from reporting sexual assault
  * Exception to the exception (FRE 412(b)(1)) - In criminal case, may still be admissible if:
    * Evidence is of specific instances of V's past sexual behavior offered for the purpose of proving someone other than D was responsible (reputation and opinion still excluded) 
    * Evidence is of specific instance of V's past sexual behavior with D offered for the purpose proving consent
    * Excluding evidence would violate D's constitutional rights
  * In civil cases, court my allow evidence about sexual predisposition if probative value substantially outweighs risk of unfair prejudice (FRE 412(b)(2))
  * Special process determining admissibility of this type of evidence
    * Requires separate motion (and accompanying notice) be made in advance by offering party
    * Court reviews evidence in camera; gives V opportunity to be heard in hearing, the record of which is sealed unless court directs otherwise
* Evidence of D's past similar crimes in sexual assault or child molestation cases
  * Under FRE 413 and 414, evidence of D committing sexual assault or child molestation (respectively) in the past is admissible, even if offered by P to prove that D acted in conformance with propensity (i.e., not just for proving one of MIMIC)
    * Does not require D to have been charged and convicted for these past specific acts; evidence may be in the form of someone coming forward for the first time
  * However, if P intends to offer this type of evidence, must disclose witness statements and expected testimony to D in advance (typically at least 15 days before trial unless court allows otherwise for good cause).
  * FRE 415 extends this to civil cases involving claims related to the alleged sexual assault of molestation as well; subject to same advance disclosure requirement

### Other Evidence with Special Relevance/Admissibility Considerations

* **Evidence of liability insurance** (e.g., malpractice insurance) is not admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. (FRE 411)
  * However, court may admit it for another purpose, such as proving a witnessâ€™s bias or prejudice or proving agency, ownership, or control.
  * Note: this is different than the Collateral Source Rule from tort law, which may also involve the admissibility of evidence of insurance
    * The CSR is a common law doctrine stating the award for an injury should not be reduced by compensation P already received from another party. Since this render evidence of such compensation irrelevant to the issues on trial, it becomes inadmissible.
    * CSR would exclude evidence of insurance payouts received by the victims rather than evidence of an insurance policy held by the tortfeasor (which is what FRE 411 does).
* **Evidence of subsequent remedial measures** (i.e., measures taken after the injury that make future one less likely to occur) are not admissible to prove negligence, products liability, culpability (FRE 407)
  * However, may be allowed for purposes like proving the feasibility of precautionary measures, as well as impeaching witnesses or demonstrating ownership/authority/control
* **Evidence of compromise offers/acceptances and negotiations** is not admissible by either party to prove the validity or amount of a claim or to impeach for prior inconsistent statement
  * Includes any conduct or statements made during compromise negotiations
  * Exceptions: may be admissible for purpose of proving witness bias, refuting claim of undue delay, or proving effort to obstruct criminal prosecution (e.g., trying to bribe the DA)
* **Evidence of pleas or statements in plea bargaining** - if someone withdraws from guilty/no-contest plea and decides to go to trial, or makes a statement in plea discussions involving prosecuting attorney, evidence of original plea or statement not admissible to prove guilt (FRE 410)
* **Evidence of the alleged wrongdoer's offers to pay expenses** (e.g., medical expenses) is not admissible (FRE 409)
  * Consistent with exclusions above for evidence of subsequent remedial measures or offers to compromise; these alone are not and admission of liability, but may in fact be legitimate,  reasonable, prudent, and/or humane responses to injury that would be deterred if this evidence were admissible
  * However, unlike compromise negotiations, any statements made in the process of offering to pay expenses are not excluded under the rule; only evidence of the existence of such offers is inadmissible

### Competency

* As a general rule, every person is, by default, presumed to be competent to be a witness unless the FRE provides otherwise (FRE 601)
  * However, FRE provides that state law governs the witnessâ€™s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision
  * When state law does not govern (i.e., federal non-diversity case), FRE leaves question to judge, who applies same "probative value > risk of prejudice" analysis as with relevance
  * FRE still sets out basic minimum rules for that are effectively competence ones since they affect whether or not witness is able to testify
    * **Personal knowledge** - witness may can only in matter if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter (FRE 602)
      * Threshold here is typically set at firsthand knowledge of the thing being testified: something capable of being perceived by ones senses and that the witness did in fact perceive (although this part can be supported by witnesses own testimony)
      * N/A to expert testimony
    * A witness must give an **oath or affirmation to testify truthfully**. The oath or affirmation must be in a "form designed to impress that duty on the witnessâ€™s conscience"
    * Jurors are incompetent to testify not only in the trial they are sitting on a (obviously), but also may not testify w/r/t deliberation process in future proceedings challenging the original verdict  
      * The only exceptions is testifying about the existence extraneous prejudicial information the jury was exposed to, external influence against juror, or mistake made on verdict form

* Under common law, used to be multiple grounds for finding witnesses incompetent and thereby disqualifying them.
  * Examples: under old common law approach to competence, you could be disqualified if you:
    * did not believe in God
    * had prior convictions (not all offenses triggered this though)
    * had beneficial interest in the case
    * were too young, retarded, or crazy to give truthful testimony under oath (this is now typically determined on individualized basis via preliminary examination of truth-telling ability; if you satisfy it, you can testify)
  * However, these are inapplicable in proceedings where the FRE governs. Further, even where state law governs (including federal diversity cases), common law has greatly evolved and, in most states, rendered these disqualifications obsolete.
    * That said, many states still have statutes known as "**Dead Man's Acts**" which prevent personal with financial interest from testifying against decedent w/r/t their communications or transactions in civil cases to which decedent's estate is party
      * However, to apply, must be a civil case, prospective witness needs to have direct interest at stake, his testimony needs to be adverse to the decedent and in favor of his interest. These can also be waived.
    * Most of these grounds for disqualification now instead factor into the question of witness credibility and may be raised for purposes of impeachment
      * Exception here is religious belief, evidence of which cannot be introduced to discredit witness

### Interrogation/Examination of Witnesses

* FRE 611 states that court should exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make those procedures effective for determining the truth, avoid wasting time, and to protect witness from harassment/embarrassment.
  * A court can also call a witness on its own (or on party's behalf) as well as examine a witness (regardless of who called them)
    * However, party may object to court calling or examining a witness
    * Advisory Com. notes warn that authority of judge to examine witness is "abused when the judge abandons his proper role and assumes that of advocate"

* Presentation of evidence in the form of (oral) witness testimony occurs through how examination and begins when party calls witness the stand
  * **Direct examination** is the questioning of the witness by the party who called them
  * The opposing party then has opportunity to examine the witness through a **cross-examination**
    * Scope of this cross-examination is typically limited to subject matter in the direct examination as well as that related the credibility of the witness (however court may allow more at its discretion) (FRE 611(b))

* Certain types of improper questions in direct and/or cross-examination that may be disallowed by the court, either on its on volition or by granting objection made be a party  allowable
  * Question may disallowed by court pursuant to specific rule (e.g., FRE 611(c)) or spart of its more general responsibilities under FRE 611(a) (e.g., prevent confusing witness)
    * Objections can be raised by party to prevent the witness from answering usually raised before witness response; if a question becomes inappropriate only in light of the answer it elicits, an objection after the fact then operates to make the answer inadmissible (i.e., strike it)
      * Can raise an objection generally or for a specific reason; however, if the court overrules object, only the former type of objection generally retains right to appeal
      * Recognized grounds for objection during examination/cross-examination include:
        * Leading questions, though not always (see more below)
        * Compound question (aka double-barreled question) - a question that require witness to provide responses to what are really two different questions
          * "How often and at what time of the day do you go usually go biking"

* FRE 611(c) explicitly identifies **leading questions**, which are those designed to a type of response that is favorable to the party questioning the witness, as ones courts should disallow in direct examinations (with a few exceptions)
  * Although generally not allowed in direct examinations, ordinarily allowed during cross-examination
  * Exception: leading questions are usually allowed in direct examination as necessary to develop witnesses testimony, if a hostile witness or adverse party is called; also may be allowed if witness is a child, experiencing memory loss, hard of hearing, or limited in english
  * **Examples**:
    * "Is it true that X was speeding when he lost control of his vehicle and hit the victim?"
    * "You were in the area at the time of the crime, were you not?"
    * "You left the party at 11 PM, correct?"
