## Present Estates

### Freehold Estates

* **Fee Simple Absolute**
  * Longest potential duration
    * Since it is inheritable and devisable, it can last forever unless owner dies intestate (in which case it *escheats* to the state)
  * Created by language "A to B and his heirs" or even just "to B"
    * A person is generally presumed to convey fee simple absolute unless otherwise specified
  * Fully alienable - it can be sold or leased without any restraints (any such attempted restraints would be void)
    * Possible exception: partial restraints under very specific circumstances (e.g., targets an individual/small group or lasts for a short time period)

* **Fee Tail**
  * Created by language “to B and the heirs to his body” or “to B and his issue/his children”)
    * Property would revert back to grantor if grantee (or someone in his direct line) died without issue
  * Virtually no states recognize this anymore; those that do allow it to be converted to fee simple absolute

* **Life Estate**
  * Lasts for the life of the grantee
    * Exception: Life estate pur autre vie, which lasts for life of someone other than the grantee ("A to B for the life of C")
  * Created by words of limitation, such as "to B, for life"
    * Can also created by implication: "to B, and after B’s death, to C"
  * Always accompanied by future interest
    * Either reversion (to grantor) or remainder (designated third party)
  * Transferable, in which case it becomes life estate pur autre vie
    * However, this does not get rid of future interest.
      * This means it is not inheritable or devisable
  * Life tenant can use property, but has duties to maintain it and not to commit waste (which he is liable for)
    * **Affirmative/Voluntary waste** - Acts that injure property, reduce its value
      * Exception: open mine rule; depleting resources not waste if part of normal use of land
    * **Permissive Waste**: Failure to act
      * Allowing property to fall into disrepair (only responsible for ordinary maintenance, not replacements/structural repairs)
      * Failing to pay property taxes, mortgage interest (not principle)
      * Liability capped at actual/reasonable rental value of property
    * **Ameliorative Waste**: acts improving value of property but decreases subjective value to future interest holder
      * Rare; difficult to prove; recognized by only a few states

### Defeasible Estates

* **Fee Simple Determinable** - ends automatically on the occurrence of a stated condition (e.g., from A to B for as long as the property is used as a school)
  * Grantor retains possibility of reverter
  * Conditional nature must be made clear; simply stating that you are conveying "for the purpose of” X is not enough.
* **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent** - ends at the election of grantor upon the occurrence of stated condition
  * Grantor retains *right of entry* or *power of termination*
  * Can be created by language like "from A to B though if B does X, A has right of entry".
    * Even absent the explicit mention of the right of entry, Courts generally interpret limiting language like "provided that X", "but only if X", or "on condition that X" as creating a FSSCS
* **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation** - terminates automatically when the condition occurs, and then transfers to a third-party. Similar to FSD, but if condition triggered/violated, automatically goes to third-party rather than reverting to grantor.
  * This third-party has an *executory interest*;
  * "From A to B; but if B ever consumes alcohol, then to C"

## Future Estates

### To Grantor

* **Reversion** - Occurs at the end of a finite estate (meaning estate is certain to end). A reversion is implied when it is unclear who property goes to at the end (e.g., "To B for B's life"()
* **Possibility of reverter** - Possibility of property reverting back to grantor; kept by grantor when conveying a FSD; automatically turns into possessory interest upon the condition being triggered/violated
* **Right of entry** - aka power of termination, created by granting FSSTCS; must be exercised in order to reclaim estate (i.e., through lawsuit)
  * Not traditionally transferable inter vivos under common law, though this has been relaxed in modern jurisdictions

### To Third Parties

* **Remainder Interests** - equivalent of reversion except with third party instead of grantor; happens **automatically** when estate normally expires (as opposed to being cut short)
  * **Contingent Remainder** - remainder interest either given to an  person yet to be ascertained or one that is subject to a condition precedent
    * Condition precedent - Condition must be satisfied *before* interest is vested (contrast with condition subsequent)
    * Ex: "to B for life, then to B's children" where B does not have any kids yet
    * Ex: "to B for life, then to C if C is a legal adult at the time of B's death"
  * **Vested Remainder** - not subject to any conditions or prevented in any other way from becoming possessory upon preceding estate expiring
    * **Vested Remainder Subject to Open** - Granted to a group, where at least one member is alive and ascertainable, and others are not alive or ascertainable at the time of conveyance. The grantee is conveyed an interest, but it is not clearly defined at this point.
      * Also referred to as Vested Remained Subject to Partial Divestment; members already ascertained have to share remainder with new members of the class
      * "A conveys to B for life, then to B's children." (B has kids but could have additional ones in the future; open for this class of potentially qualifying members)
    * **Vested remainder subject to divestment** - Remainder interest subject to condition subsequent
      * "A conveys to B for life, then to C for as long as C is financially solvent
* **Executory Interest** - equivalent of right of entry or possibility of reverter for third-party; if it only vests by cutting previous estate short or if it doesn't become possessory automatically upon previous estate ending, it is an executory interest not a remainder.
  * Shifting Executory Interest - takes from one grantee and gives it to another
  * Springing Executory Interest - takes from grantor and gives to grantee

* **Rule Against Perpetuities**
* Rule that prevents conveyance of interests that could vest far in the very distant future.
  * To vest = to give an immediate, fixed right of present or future enjoyment (as defined by West's Encyclopedia of American Law).
  * Interest must vest or fail to vest within a certain period, measured from the lives of the persons involved, else the future interest is void
  * Primary purpose is to prevent limitations/qualifications on property that continue to affect ownership long after persons involved are dead
* Common law approach:
  * > "No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest" - John Chipman Gray
  * Some life in being at the creation = any of the parties relevant to the conveyance that are alive that the time it is made
  * In other words, if the interest could vest after all parties involved could die and 21 years pass (regardless of how improbable), it is immediately void
* Some modern jurisdictions (aka the Wait-and-See Approach):
  * Future interest must vest or fail to vest within 90 years of conveyance. If the interest hasn't certainly vested after 90 years, it is voided
* Applies to:
  * Vested remainder subject to open
    * Example: To A for life, then to his children, then to his grandchildren who graduate college
      * Assuming A already has 1 grandchild who graduated college. Possible that subsequent grandchildren are born and graduate college 21 years after everyone dies, therefore it violates RAP.
      * All-or-nothing rule: If it could violate RAP for one class member, is violates it for all
  * contingent remainder
  * executory interest
  * purchase options
* N/A to:
  * reversion
  * possibility of reverter
  * right of entry
* Where future interest is stricken down by RAP, grantor gets possibility of reverter
  * Example: A to B, for as long as property is not used to sell Alcohol, then to C.
    * B has FSD
    * C would have executory interest, but since it is possible that alcohol is still not sold on property 21 years after all parties, it is stricken by RAP
    * Thus creates possibility of reverter in A (not subject to RAP)
* Perpetuity saving clause - prevents conveyance from being voided by RAP by ensuring that vesting occurs w/in permissible time period
  * Using example from earlier: A to B, for as long as property is not used to sell Alcohol during his lifetime, then to C.
* Exceptions:
  * Where gift to one charity with remainder/executory interest to another charity

## Landlord and Tenant Law (Leasehold Estates)

* A lease, in the traditional common law view, is a conveyance of the rights to use and enjoy (i.e., rights of possession) for period of time; this naturally favored landlords
  * Eventually, this began to trend towards a more contractual view which frequently relied on law of contracts to resolve disputes
    * Given disparities in bargaining power, modern view treats leases more like regulated contracts; much more tenant friendly

### Term of Years (aka Tenancy for Years)

* Lasts for fixed period; automatically terminates at a pre-specified time
  * Does not necessarily have to be measured in years; could last a few weeks or months
  * Notice not required to terminate at pre-determined time
* Statute of frauds - requires leases of a certain duration be signed in writing
  * In most modern jurisdictions this is any lease with a duration of more than 1 year

### Periodic Tenancy

* Lease for automatically renewing time period; continues indefinitely until a party gives notice of termination
  * e.g., month-to-month, year-to-year
* Advance notice necessary to terminate
  * Traditional common law rule: must give notice at least one period in advance, but no longer than 6 months
    * This would mean 6 months notice for year-to-year, 1 month notice for month-to-month
    * Notice must be given by last day of previous period notice else not effective
      * Example: if month-to-month starting June 1st and you find out you are moving on October 2nd, earliest you could terminate is November 31st
  * However, typically regulated via state statute now: year-to-year requires only months notice
* Can be created:
  * Explicitly - lease agreement says it is month-to-month
  * Implicitly - if no duration specified, court will presume periodic tenancy with period based on rent payment
  * Other - where lease is defective (e.g., violates SOF), but landlord continues accepting rent

### Tenancy at Will

* No fixed term and can be terminated at will without advanced notice (at least at common law)
  * Modern jurisdiction have trended towards requiring reasonable advance notice
* Usually only recognized if created using very clear and explicit language
  * Disfavored for obvious reasons

### Tenancy at Sufferance

* Type of tenancy in holdover situations, where tenant overstays lease (i.e., remains in possession after lease expires). Landlord can either elect to:
  * Continue to accept rent, implicitly creating new periodic lease equal in duration to the rent/renewable period of the original lease (max is year-to-year)
    * Usually month-to-month; if lease was 1 year or longer, becomes year-to-year
  * Evict/sue (as tenant would be trespassing at this point)
    * Original lease may include provision stating tenant is liable for increased or even doubled rent in holdover situation; some statutes may do this as well (e.g., New Jersey)
* Remedies in these situations usually come from state statute now instead of common law

### Rights and Obligations in Leasehold estates

* **Obligations of Tenants**
  * Fulfill the obligations explicitly contained in the lease
    * Includes making rent payments on time and at agreed upon rate for entire duration (unless otherwise specified)
    * Also includes vacating property upon expiration of the lease
    * When T abandons property without intent to return and stops paying rent, this is a breach; L can sue for owed rent
  * Refrain from committing waste or nuisance
    * See section on Life Estates for more on waste
    * Some leases have terms that completely shifts burden of repairs/maintenance onto the tenant; generally enforceable unless has the effect of waving warranty of habitability (this is not something you can contract around)
  * To secure these obligations or remedy T's failure to perform them, L may:
    * Hold a security deposit and pay back with interest.
      * Normally limited to 2 months’ rent, but this can be circumvented by styling a security deposit as “advance rent.”
    * Commence summary eviction proceedings (Notice to T, quick trail)
      * Alternative to self-help
    * Provide a new lease with the same conditions to a holdover T.
    * Bring action 

* **Obligations of Landlords**
  * Delivery of possession - L had duty to ensure rights of possession are delivered to T when lease starts
    * Majority: Delivery includes actual, physical possession. This meant if trespasser/holdover still on property, L responsible for expelling them. Failure to do so would result in breach
    * Minority: Historically, American jurisdictions only required L to convey legal rights of possession. T would need to enforce rights himself. This is now a minority rule
  * Implied covenant of quiet enjoyment - imposes duty on L not interfere with T's possession/occupancy/beneficial use of the property
    * Implicit in all lease agreements and can't be disclaimed
    * If L (or L’s agent/person with paramount title) breaches this covenant and it constitutes an eviction, tenant is relieved of duty to pay rent and may even be entitled to damages. Eviction can be:
      * Actual eviction - L (or agent/person with superior title) ousts the tenant from part or all of the premises
        * T can terminate lease and is entitled to benefit of the bargain
        * In case of partial eviction, can keep lease and withhold rent until parts of property interfered with are restored
          * Although restatement endorses partial rent abatement proportional to part taken, this is not case in most states and full abatement is excused (possible exception is where third-party w/ paramount title is responsible)
      * Constructive Eviction - substantial interference with use/enjoyment; so substantial that it justifies T leaving property reasonably promptly; affirmative defense in actions for failure to pay rent
        * Occurs when L negligently performs or fails to perform duty owed to T, such as making repairs, removing unsafe conditions, removing nuisances, and in-turn T suffers **substantial** loss of the use and enjoyment of premises
          * Generally, duty does not cover neighbors and third parties unless LL has notice of problematic activity and some reasonable control over it yet fails to do so
          * T must abandon the property reasonably promptly in response to interference
  * Implied warranty of habitability - requires L to ensure property is delivered and remains in a safe, liveable condition (i.e. one reasonably fit for human occupation).
    * Recognized in many states, but only applicable to residential property
    * If breached (e.g., T notifies L about condition, L fails to do anything about it), T can:
      * withhold rent until it is corrected
      * get it fixed himself and deduct costs from rent
      * sue for damages, rescission, or even injunctive relief (e.g., specific performance)
    * Violation of IWH can also be used as affirmative defense if being sued for breach (e.g., for failure to pay rent)
    * Most jurisdictions have housing codes that can interact with the IWH, but the way it does varies:
      * Noncompliance with code might be automatically treated as breach (similar to negligence per se)
      * Noncompliance might create rebuttable presumption of breach
      * The two might be treated independently
  * Duty to Mitigate - where T abandons property, L has duty to mitigate harm by attempting to re-let the property; T liable for the remaining difference
    * Can also accept T's abandonment as an offer of surrender; retakes possession and lets T off the hook as of that date
