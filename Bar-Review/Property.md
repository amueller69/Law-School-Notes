## Interests in Land

### Present Estates

* **Fee Simple Absolute**
  * Longest potential duration
    * Since it is inheritable.devisable, it can last forever unless owner dies intestate (in which case it *escheats* to the state)
  * Created by language "A to B and his heirs" or even just "to B"
    * A person is generally presumed to convey fee simple absolute unless otherwise specified
  * Fully alienable - it can be sold or leased without any restraints (any such attempted restraints would be void)
    * Possible exception: partial restraints under very specific circumstances (e.g., targets an individual/small group or lasts for a short time period)

* **Fee Tail**
  * Created by language “to B and the heirs to his body” or “to B and his issue/his children”)
    * Property would revert back to grantor if grantee (or someone in his direct line) died without issue
  * Virtually no states recognize this anymore; those that do allow it to be converted to fee simple absolute

* **Life Estate**
  * Lasts for the life of the grantee
    * Exception: Life estate pur autre vie, which lasts for life of someone other than the grantee ("A to B for the life of C")
  * Created by words of limitation, such as "to B, for life"
    * Can also created by implication: "to B, and after B’s death, to C"
  * Always accompanied by future interest
    * Either reversion (to grantor) or remainder (designated third party)
  * Transferable, in which case it becomes life estate pur autre vie
    * However, this does not get rid of future interest.
      * This means it is not inheritable or devisable
  * Life tenant can use property, but has duties to maintain it and not to commit waste (which he is liable for)
    * **Affirmative/Voluntary waste** - Acts that injure property, reduce its value
      * Exception: open mine rule; depleting resources not waste if part of normal use of land
    * **Permissive Waste**: Failure to act
      * Allowing property to fall into disrepair (only responsible for ordinary maintenance, not replacements/structural repairs)
      * Failing to pay property taxes, mortgage interest (not principle)
      * Liability capped at actual/reasonable rental value of property
    * **Ameliorative Waste**: acts improving value of property but decreases subjective value to future interest holder
      * Rare; difficult to prove; recognized by only a few states

* **Defeasible Estates**
  * **Fee Simple Determinable** - ends automatically on the occurrence of a stated condition (e.g., from A to B for as long as the property is used as a school)
    * Grantor retains possibility of reverter
    * Conditional nature must be made clear; simply stating that you are conveying "for the purpose of” X is not enough.
  * **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent** - ends at the election of grantor upon the occurrence of stated condition
    * Grantor retains *right of entry* or *power of termination*
    * Can be created by language like "from A to B though if B does X, A has right of entry".
      * Even absent the explicit mention of the right of entry, Courts generally interpret limiting language like "provided that X", "but only if X", or "on condition that X" as creating a FSSCS
  * **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation** - terminates automatically when the condition occurs, and then transfers to a third-party. Similar to FSD, but if condition triggered/violated, automatically goes to third-party rather than reverting to grantor.
    * This third-party has an *executory interest*;
    * "From A to B; but if B ever consumes alcohol, then to C"

### Summary of Future Interests

* To Grantor
  * **Reversion** - Occurs at the end of a finite estate (meaning estate is certain to end). A reversion is implied when it is unclear who property goes to at the end (e.g., "To B for B's life"()
  * **Possibility of reverter** - Possibility of property reverting back to grantor; kept by grantor when conveying a FSD; automatically turns into possessory interest upon the condition being triggered/violated
  * **Right of entry** - aka power of termination, created by granting FSSTCS; must be exercised in order to reclaim estate (i.e., through lawsuit)
    * Not traditionally transferable inter vivos under common law, though this has been relaxed in modern jurisdictions

* To Third Parties
  * **Remainder Interests** - equivalent of reversion except with third party instead of grantor; happens **automatically** when estate normally expires (as opposed to being cut short)
    * **Contingent Remainder** - remainder interest either given to an  person yet to be ascertained or one that is subject to a condition precedent
      * Condition precedent - Condition must be satisfied *before* interest is vested (contrast with condition subsequent)
      * Ex: "to B for life, then to B's children" where B does not have any kids yet
      * Ex: "to B for life, then to C if C is a legal adult at the time of B's death"
    * **Vested Remainder** - not subject to any conditions or prevented in any other way from becoming possessory upon preceding estate expiring
      * **Vested Remainder Subject to Open** - Granted to a group, where at least one member is alive and ascertainable, and others are not alive or ascertainable at the time of conveyance. The grantee is conveyed an interest, but it is not clearly defined at this point.
        * Also referred to as Vested Remained Subject to Partial Divestment; members already ascertained have to share remainder with new members of the class
        * "A conveys to B for life, then to B's children." (B has kids but could have additional ones in the future; open for this class of potentially qualifying members)
      * **Vested remainder subject to divestment** - Remainder interest subject to condition subsequent
        * "A conveys to B for life, then to C for as long as C is financially solvent
  * **Executory Interest** - equivalent of right of entry or possibility of reverter for third-party; if it only vests by cutting previous estate short or if it doesn't become possessory automatically upon previous estate ending, it is an executory interest not a remainder.
