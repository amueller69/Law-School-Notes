# Property

## Present Estates

### Freehold Estates

* **Fee Simple Absolute**
  * Longest potential duration
    * Since it is inheritable and devisable, it can last forever unless owner dies intestate (in which case it *escheats* to the state)
  * Created by language "A to B and his heirs" or even just "to B"
    * A person is generally presumed to convey fee simple absolute unless otherwise specified
  * Fully alienable - it can be sold or leased without any restraints (any such attempted restraints would be void)
    * Possible exception: partial restraints under very specific circumstances (e.g., targets an individual/small group or lasts for a short time period)

* **Fee Tail**
  * Created by language “to B and the heirs to his body” or “to B and his issue/his children”)
    * Property would revert back to grantor if grantee (or someone in his direct line) died without issue
  * Virtually no states recognize this anymore; those that do allow it to be converted to fee simple absolute

* **Life Estate**
  * Lasts for the life of the grantee
    * Exception: Life estate pur autre vie, which lasts for life of someone other than the grantee ("A to B for the life of C")
  * Created by words of limitation, such as "to B, for life"
    * Can also created by implication: "to B, and after B’s death, to C"
  * Always accompanied by future interest
    * Either reversion (to grantor) or remainder (designated third party)
  * Transferable, in which case it becomes life estate pur autre vie
    * However, this does not get rid of future interest.
      * This means it is not inheritable or devisable
  * Life tenant can use property, but has duties to maintain it and not to commit waste (which he is liable for)
    * **Affirmative/Voluntary waste** - Acts that injure property, reduce its value
      * Exception: open mine rule; depleting resources not waste if part of normal use of land
    * **Permissive Waste**: Failure to act
      * Allowing property to fall into disrepair (only responsible for ordinary maintenance, not replacements/structural repairs)
      * Failing to pay property taxes, mortgage interest (not principle)
      * Liability capped at actual/reasonable rental value of property
    * **Ameliorative Waste**: acts improving value of property but decreases subjective value to future interest holder
      * Rare; difficult to prove; recognized by only a few states

### Defeasible Estates

* **Fee Simple Determinable** - ends automatically on the occurrence of a stated condition (e.g., from A to B for as long as the property is used as a school)
  * Grantor retains possibility of reverter
  * Conditional nature must be made clear; simply stating that you are conveying "for the purpose of” X is not enough.
* **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent** - ends at the election of grantor upon the occurrence of stated condition
  * Grantor retains *right of entry* or *power of termination*
  * Can be created by language like "from A to B though if B does X, A has right of entry".
    * Even absent the explicit mention of the right of entry, Courts generally interpret limiting language like "provided that X", "but only if X", or "on condition that X" as creating a FSSCS
* **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation** - terminates automatically when the condition occurs, and then transfers to a third-party. Similar to FSD, but if condition triggered/violated, automatically goes to third-party rather than reverting to grantor.
  * This third-party has an *executory interest*;
  * "From A to B; but if B ever consumes alcohol, then to C"

## Future Estates

### To Grantor

* **Reversion** - Occurs at the end of a finite estate (meaning estate is certain to end). A reversion is implied when it is unclear who property goes to at the end (e.g., "To B for B's life"()
* **Possibility of reverter** - Possibility of property reverting back to grantor; kept by grantor when conveying a FSD; automatically turns into possessory interest upon the condition being triggered/violated
* **Right of entry** - aka power of termination, created by granting FSSTCS; must be exercised in order to reclaim estate (i.e., through lawsuit)
  * Not traditionally transferable inter vivos under common law, though this has been relaxed in modern jurisdictions

### To Third Parties

* **Remainder Interests** - equivalent of reversion except with third party instead of grantor; happens **automatically** when estate normally expires (as opposed to being cut short)
  * **Contingent Remainder** - remainder interest either given to an  person yet to be ascertained or one that is subject to a condition precedent
    * Condition precedent - Condition must be satisfied *before* interest is vested (contrast with condition subsequent)
    * Ex: "to B for life, then to B's children" where B does not have any kids yet
    * Ex: "to B for life, then to C if C is a legal adult at the time of B's death"
  * **Vested Remainder** - not subject to any conditions or prevented in any other way from becoming possessory upon preceding estate expiring
    * **Vested Remainder Subject to Open** - Granted to a group, where at least one member is alive and ascertainable, and others are not alive or ascertainable at the time of conveyance. The grantee is conveyed an interest, but it is not clearly defined at this point.
      * Also referred to as Vested Remained Subject to Partial Divestment; members already ascertained have to share remainder with new members of the class
      * "A conveys to B for life, then to B's children." (B has kids but could have additional ones in the future; open for this class of potentially qualifying members)
    * **Vested remainder subject to divestment** - Remainder interest subject to condition subsequent
      * "A conveys to B for life, then to C for as long as C is financially solvent
* **Executory Interest** - equivalent of right of entry or possibility of reverter for third-party; if it only vests by cutting previous estate short or if it doesn't become possessory automatically upon previous estate ending, it is an executory interest not a remainder.
  * Shifting Executory Interest - takes from one grantee and gives it to another
  * Springing Executory Interest - takes from grantor and gives to grantee

* **Rule Against Perpetuities**
* Rule that prevents conveyance of interests that could vest far in the very distant future.
  * To vest = to give an immediate, fixed right of present or future enjoyment (as defined by West's Encyclopedia of American Law).
  * Interest must vest or fail to vest within a certain period, measured from the lives of the persons involved, else the future interest is void
  * Primary purpose is to prevent limitations/qualifications on property that continue to affect ownership long after persons involved are dead
* Common law approach:
  * > "No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest" - John Chipman Gray
  * Some life in being at the creation = any of the parties relevant to the conveyance that are alive that the time it is made
  * In other words, if the interest could vest after all parties involved could die and 21 years pass (regardless of how improbable), it is immediately void
* Some modern jurisdictions (aka the Wait-and-See Approach):
  * Future interest must vest or fail to vest within 90 years of conveyance. If the interest hasn't certainly vested after 90 years, it is voided
* Applies to:
  * Vested remainder subject to open
    * Example: To A for life, then to his children, then to his grandchildren who graduate college
      * Assuming A already has 1 grandchild who graduated college. Possible that subsequent grandchildren are born and graduate college 21 years after everyone dies, therefore it violates RAP.
      * All-or-nothing rule: If it could violate RAP for one class member, is violates it for all
  * contingent remainder
  * executory interest
  * purchase options
* N/A to:
  * reversion
  * possibility of reverter
  * right of entry
* Where future interest is stricken down by RAP, grantor gets possibility of reverter
  * Example: A to B, for as long as property is not used to sell Alcohol, then to C.
    * B has FSD
    * C would have executory interest, but since it is possible that alcohol is still not sold on property 21 years after all parties, it is stricken by RAP
    * Thus creates possibility of reverter in A (not subject to RAP)
* Perpetuity saving clause - prevents conveyance from being voided by RAP by ensuring that vesting occurs w/in permissible time period
  * Using example from earlier: A to B, for as long as property is not used to sell Alcohol during his lifetime, then to C.
* Exceptions:
  * Where gift to one charity with remainder/executory interest to another charity

## Landlord and Tenant Law (Leasehold Estates)

* A lease, in the traditional common law view, is a conveyance of the rights to use and enjoy (i.e., rights of possession) for period of time; this naturally favored landlords
  * Eventually, this began to trend towards a more contractual view which frequently relied on law of contracts to resolve disputes
    * Given disparities in bargaining power, modern view treats leases more like regulated contracts; much more tenant friendly

### Term of Years (aka Tenancy for Years)

* Lasts for fixed period; automatically terminates at a pre-specified time
  * Does not necessarily have to be measured in years; could last a few weeks or months
  * Notice not required to terminate at pre-determined time
* Statute of frauds - requires leases of a certain duration be signed in writing
  * In most modern jurisdictions this is any lease with a duration of more than 1 year

### Periodic Tenancy

* Lease for automatically renewing time period; continues indefinitely until a party gives notice of termination
  * e.g., month-to-month, year-to-year
* Advance notice necessary to terminate
  * Traditional common law rule: must give notice at least one period in advance, but no longer than 6 months
    * This would mean 6 months notice for year-to-year, 1 month notice for month-to-month
    * Notice must be given by last day of previous period notice else not effective
      * Example: if month-to-month starting June 1st and you find out you are moving on October 2nd, earliest you could terminate is November 31st
  * However, typically regulated via state statute now: year-to-year requires only months notice
* Can be created:
  * Explicitly - lease agreement says it is month-to-month
  * Implicitly - if no duration specified, court will presume periodic tenancy with period based on rent payment
  * Other - where lease is defective (e.g., violates SOF), but landlord continues accepting rent

### Tenancy at Will

* No fixed term and can be terminated at will without advanced notice (at least at common law)
  * Modern jurisdiction have trended towards requiring reasonable advance notice
* Usually only recognized if created using very clear and explicit language
  * Disfavored for obvious reasons

### Tenancy at Sufferance

* Type of tenancy in holdover situations, where tenant overstays lease (i.e., remains in possession after lease expires). Landlord can either elect to:
  * Continue to accept rent, implicitly creating new periodic lease equal in duration to the rent/renewable period of the original lease (max is year-to-year)
    * Usually month-to-month; if lease was 1 year or longer, becomes year-to-year
  * Evict/sue (as tenant would be trespassing at this point)
    * Original lease may include provision stating tenant is liable for increased or even doubled rent in holdover situation; some statutes may do this as well (e.g., New Jersey)
* Remedies in these situations usually come from state statute now instead of common law

### Rights and Obligations in Leasehold estates

* **Obligations of Tenants**
  * Must fulfill the obligations explicitly contained in the lease
    * Includes making rent payments on time and at agreed upon rate for entire duration (unless otherwise specified)
    * Also includes vacating property upon expiration of the lease
    * When T abandons property without intent to return and stops paying rent, this is a breach; L can sue for owed rent
      * Modern exception: Property is destroyed through some fault other than T's own (e.g., natural disaster, arson, etc.)
  * Must refrain from committing waste or nuisance
    * Ordinary wear and tear is exempted
    * See section on Life Estates for more on waste
    * Some leases have terms that completely shifts burden of repairs/maintenance onto the tenant; generally enforceable unless has the effect of waving warranty of habitability (this is not something you can contract around)

* **Obligations of Landlords**
  * Delivery of possession - L has duty to ensure rights of possession are delivered to T when lease starts
    * Majority: Delivery includes actual, physical possession. This meant if trespasser/holdover still on property, L responsible for expelling them. Failure to do so would result in breach
    * Minority: Historically, American jurisdictions only required L to convey legal rights of possession. T would need to enforce rights himself. This is now a minority rule
  * Implied covenant of quiet enjoyment - imposes duty on L not interfere with T's possession/occupancy/beneficial use of the property
    * Implicit in all lease agreements and can't be disclaimed
    * If L (or L’s agent/person with paramount title) breaches this covenant and it constitutes an eviction, tenant is relieved of duty to pay rent and may even be entitled to damages. Eviction can be:
      * Actual eviction - L (or agent/person with superior title) ousts the tenant from part or all of the premises
        * T can terminate lease and is entitled to benefit of the bargain
        * In case of partial eviction, can keep lease and withhold rent until parts of property interfered with are restored
          * Although restatement endorses partial rent abatement proportional to part taken, this is not case in most states and full abatement is excused (possible exception is where third-party w/ paramount title is responsible)
      * Constructive Eviction - substantial interference with use/enjoyment; so substantial that it justifies T leaving property reasonably promptly; affirmative defense in actions for failure to pay rent
        * Occurs when L negligently performs or fails to perform duty owed to T, such as making repairs, removing unsafe conditions, removing nuisances, and in-turn T suffers **substantial** loss of the use and enjoyment of premises
          * Generally, duty does not cover neighbors and third parties unless LL has notice of problematic activity and some reasonable control over it yet fails to do so
          * T must abandon the property reasonably promptly in response to interference
  * Implied warranty of habitability - requires L to ensure property is delivered and remains in a safe, liveable condition (i.e. one reasonably fit for human occupation).
    * Recognized in many states, but only applicable to residential property
    * If breached (e.g., T notifies L about condition, L fails to do anything about it), T can:
      * withhold rent until it is corrected
      * get it fixed himself and deduct costs from rent
      * sue for damages, rescission, or even injunctive relief (e.g., specific performance)
    * Violation of IWH can also be used as affirmative defense if being sued for breach (e.g., for failure to pay rent)
    * Most jurisdictions have housing codes that can interact with the IWH, but the way it does varies:
      * Noncompliance with code might be automatically treated as breach (similar to negligence per se)
      * Noncompliance might create rebuttable presumption of breach
      * The two might be treated independently
  * Duty to Mitigate - where T abandons property, L has duty to mitigate harm by attempting to re-let the property; T liable for the remaining difference
    * Can also accept T's abandonment as an offer of surrender; retakes possession and lets T off the hook as of that date
      * L needs to be careful when trying to re-let in order to mitigate loss; this could be interpreted as his implicit acceptance of the surrender; L should make his intent clear

* **Rights and Remedies of Tenants**
  * The right to be free from discriminatory treatment
    * Under § 3604 of the FHA: It is unlawful to:
      * Refuse to negotiate, or deny a dwelling to a person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin
      * offer inferior services or terms based on the above categories
      * advertise in a discriminatory way, indicating a preference or limitation in reference to above categories, as well as disability status
      * misrepresent the availability/status of a dwelling based on the categories above (including disabled)
      * induce a person to sell or rent any dwelling by representation regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood by individuals of a class defined by one of the above categories (including disabled) (e.g., can't accelerate white flight for profit).
  * Protection against retaliatory eviction - residential property only
    * T cannot be threatened with eviction, increased rent, or withholding performance of obligations (e.g., repair) because T filed complaint or legal action
    * Retaliatory eviction an be invoked as a cause of action against L or as defense in eviction proceedings initiated by L
    * Contractual waivers of this defense/cause of action are not enforceable
    * Rebuttable assumption of retaliation if occurring within certain amount of time after complaint/legal action was taken (90-180 days)

* **Rights and Remedies of Landlords**
  * To secure the obligations of T or remedy his failure to perform them, L may:
    * Hold a security deposit and pay back with interest.
      * Normally limited to 2 months’ rent, but this can be circumvented by styling a security deposit as “advance rent.”
    * Commence summary eviction proceedings (Notice to T, quick trail)
      * Alternative to self-help
    * Provide a new lease with the same conditions to a holdover T.
    * Bring action to recover unpaid rent that is past due
      * Moreover, contract law doctrine of anticipatory repudiation (aka anticipatory breach) may allow lawsuits for unpaid future rent under the modern contractual view of leases.
        * When party evidences lack of ability or intention to perform K (either through clear statement or action that clearly implies it), the other party is entitled to terminate contract and can sue for the extent to which they were deprived of the benefit of the bargain

### Tort Liability in Landlord/Tenant Relationships

* Landlord Liability
  * Generally not liable for to T or T's invitees for injuries sustained on the leased property
  * Exceptions
    * Latent defects - Injuries sustained by hidden defects that L knew (or reasonably should have known) about and failed to disclose
    * Common areas - Injury's sustained due to failure to exercise reasonable care in detecting/correcting hazardous conditions in areas of property still under L's control
    * Negligent repairs - Injury sustained resulting from defective repairs performed by L on the leased property
    * Potential liability for  criminal acts committed by third-parties
      * Some courts have held landlords liable for failing to provide reasonable security, thereby allowing criminal third-party to cause harm to tenant
* Tenant Liability
  * T liable as social host for harm sustained by his own invitees on the leased property

### Transfer of Rights under a Lease

* Because lease is simultaneously a contract and property conveyance, privity of estate and privity of contract exist between LL and original tenant
  * **Privity of Estate**: Relationship that exists between parties with successive interests in the same property (i.e., present L and present T)
  * **Privity of Contract**: relationship that exists between parties to a K, person who is not party to the K cannot avail himself of the K’s terms
    * Always privity of K between original parties to agreement (absent a novation), as well as any subsequent parties who expressly assume the obligations of the original K
* By Landlord
  * Can be freely assign property interest to another party (e.g., through selling the property)
  * If party is assigned all L's rights and thereby assumes its obligations, any K claim that could have been asserted against original L can be asserted against the new one
* By Tenant
  * Can freely transfer interest in lease unless explicitly prohibited in the agreement 
    * If instead requires L's consent, there must be a legitimate and commercially reasonable justification for withholding this consent (e.g., concerns about subtenants financial condition)
    * Consent can be implied by L accepting rent payment from transferee
    * Consent to one transfer waives need for consent in future transfers unless explicitly reserved by L
  * Transfer can either be a sub-lease or an assignment
    * **Assignment**: when tenant transfers entire remaining interest in the lease (i.e., for the rest of the lease term)
    * **Sublease**: when tenant transfers anything less than the entire remaining interest; original (head) T retains portion of remaining lease term and has right to possession once sub-lease term expires
    * Determine which exists by looking at intent of the parties as manifested in the transaction
    * Sublease nor assignment automatically ends original T's obligations under lease
      * As noted above, still privity of K (unless L agreed to release original T through a novation) between original T and L, but not between new T and L.
        * This means sub-tenant/assignee can't sue L for breaching contractual provisions (or vice-versa)
      * Depending on whether it is an assignment or sublease, there may not be privity of estate between L and current T
        * If sublease, then no P of E since they do not share successive interests in the land (head tenant is in-between them, has reversion)
          * L can't sue ST for unpaid rent; ST can't sue for breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment
          * However, L can sue to evict assignee for unpaid rent and/or violations of covenants that touch & concern the land, while assignee can sue for breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment

## Concurrent Interests (Co-Tenancies)

There are three types of co-tenancies

### Tenancy in Common

* Separate but undivided interest in property (i.e., no party has exclusive right to a part of the property); each has a right to possess and use the entire property
  * This simultaneous right to possession (aka "unity of possession") is the only required "unity"
  * Interests (% share), title, and time of acquisition can all vary among co-tenants

* Interest can be freely leased or sold; also typically has no right of survivorship
  * If A and B are tenants in common of property and A dies, A's share does not to go B
  * Instead, it goes party designated in A's will
  * This allows it to be devised or inherited

* TiC is the default
  * Presumed to have been created whenever conveyance/devise is made to multiple persons to enjoy at same time.
  * If creation of joint tenancy is defective or is unclear what form of co-tenancy was intended, it is likely interpreted to be an TiC
* Two ways to terminate

### Joint Tenancy

* Requires four "unities", not just that of possession
  * Unity of possession: All joint tenants have full rights
  * Unity of interest: All tenants have the same share of interest (e.g. 50-50) and same duration of interest
  * Unity of title: All joint tenants are conveyed property by the same deed/will/adverse possession
  * Unity of time: All interests vested at the same time

* Defining feature is rights of survivorship
  * When one joint tenant dies, the others take the deceased's interest automatically
  * Makes a JT non-devisable/inheritable

* Used to be created automatically whenever all 4 unities were present. However, it now usually requires explicit language about the right of survivorship
  * Example:"A conveys to B & C as joint tenants, not as tenants in common, with a right of survivorship"

* Can be terminated unilaterally by severing one of the 4 unities:
  * Conveyance to third party by a joint tenant - this severs unities of time and title
    * JT still exists between original parties; however, they become tenants in common with new party, meaning no longer right to survivorship w/r/t his share
    * Some jurisdictions even permit conveying to oneself in order to convert JT into TiC
  * Mortgage by a joint tenant - however only in (minority of) states recognizing title theory of mortgages instead of lien theory
    * Under lien theory, legal title remains with the mortgagor unless there is foreclosure, whereas under mortgage theory, there is conveyance of title that makes mortgagor a tenant in common
  * Lease by a joint tenant (courts are split) - severs unities of possession and title
    * Some jurisdictions have found that leases do not sever a joint tenancy, preserving rights of survivorship.
  
### Tenancy by Entirety

* Tenancy by the entireties require the four unities of the joint tenancy plus a fifth (marriage)
  * Recognized in ~half of states
  * Have right of survivorship - if spouse dies, surviving spouse takes

* Spouses treated as one economic unit
  * One spouse acting alone cannot convey or encumber the property
  * Tenancy can't be severed unilaterally

* Termination can only occur if:
  * Spouse dies
  * Divorce or mutual agreement/release
  * Joint creditor executes claim

### Rights & Duties of Co-Tenants

* Possession - Each co-tenant has a right to possess
  * No single co-tenant has exclusive right to possess any part of the estate
  * Similarly, no co-tenant can deny another co-tenant possession (ouster)
    * Ouster only exists when a co-tenant’s actions have no legitimate purpose (unlike something such as changing locks, which can have a legitimate purpose.), and the ousted party demands and is rejected entry.
    * If this happens, can sue for ejectment to recover possession and potentially monetary damages on top of it (e.g., reasonable portion of the rental value during ousted period)

* Rent and profit sharing
  * As a general rule, no obligation to pay rent to another co-tenant
    * Exception: rental value as a remedy for ouster
    * Exception: Where rent is from lease of property to third-party
  * Co-tenant who profits from the lands natural resources must also account to others for their fair share

* Contribution
  * Can collect from others for fair share for taxes & mortgage payments
  * However, majority rule is no right contribution from others for repairs or improvements to property, absent an agreement to that effect
    * Minority rule allows contribution, but only for necessary repairs
    * However, reasonable cost of such repairs will be credited to the co-tenant who made them in an accounting or partition action
* Waste - If a co-tenant makes the property worse, they can be sued for waste

### Partition

* Common and joint tenancies can be partitioned, following petition to court, in two ways:
  * **Partition in kind**: Property is physically partitioned, with each owner gaining a portion (which they are the sole owner of) equivalent to her share
    * If one co-tenant awarded more valuable part, may be required to compensate others
      * This is called an owelty: Give all of the property to one party and compensate the other (The same outcome can result in partition by sale.)
    * Benefits:
      * Keeps property in owners' hands
      * Preserves subjective value of property
      * Prevents strong co-tenants (who would buy the property under partition by sale) from timing sale to harm weak co-tenants
      * Preserves ownership by minority interest holders
  * **Partition by sale**: Property is sold and the proceeds divided according to share
    * The more extreme remedy, but actually quite common. Often elected when partition in kind would be impractical
      * Preserves asset configuration
      * Flexible, because divides money instead of land
      * Easier and cheaper to administer
  * Alternative is to work it out between co-tenants and then file uncontested petition with court to make it a matter of record
