# Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts

## In General

* Subject matter jurisdiction is the authority/power that a federal court has to hear certain cases
* There are two basic “species” of subject matter jurisdiction:
  * “Arising Under”: also known as “federal question” jurisdiction; this is when the claims in a case “arise under” federal oversight. This might occur when a claim comes up because of a federal law or constitutional issue.
  * “Diversity”: diversity jurisdiction is when all the defendants reside in different states from all the plaintiffs (complete diversity). There is also a requirement that the amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Grounded in article 3 of the constitution, which embodies the principle of enumerated powers. T
  * The powers that the federal government has in our federal-state system are supreme. Federal policy supersedes state policy when they clash
  * However, because our federal government is a limited government, the objects it can speak to are limited to what is provided in the Constitution
  * The judicial version of the enumerated powers doctrine is Article 3, which defines the powers of the judiciary. Matter of shaping scope and power of the federal judiciary
* Art III §2: The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority…
  * Controversies where the United States is a party
  * Controversies between two or more States
  * Between a State and citizens of another State
  * Between citizens of different states
  * Etc.
* Statute—there must also be statutory authority that allows courts to hear claims. Courts interpret the statutes narrowly, even though the terms are similar to those in the Constitution
  * 28 U.S.C. §1331. Federal Question: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States
  * 28 U.S.C. §1332. Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs
  * Narrow statutory interpretation prevents the district courts from being overwhelmed
* Unlike PJ analysis which was largely focused on constitutional issues, SMJ analysis mostly involves interpretation of statutes
* Can't simply waive it like a party can submit itself to the authority of a court with personal jurisdiction
* Sua Sponte: on its own motion
  * Courts have responsibility to address SMJ questions on its own (not just on motions raised by litigants)
  * Determination that it does not have SMJ nullifies all litigation

## Diversity Jurisdiction

* Diversity Requirements (governed by §1332(a)(1))
  * Complete diversity
  * Amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Citizenship
  * Determining citizenship:
    * Individual - domicility defines citizenship
    * Corporations - Principal place of business (under *Hertz*, the “nerve center”) OR the state of incorporation
    * Partnership - assumes the diversity of its "members" (e.g. MLB in *Rose*)
  * When is citizenship determined?
    * At the time the lawsuit begins (time of filing), not at the time of the events that led to the lawsuit
      * Post-filing move by a party does not defeat diversity
    * Implication: can change citizenship before litigation, but changes in citizenship after a lawsuit has been initiated do not affect diversity
  * What if a suit could be diverse but a party’s citizenship destroys diversity? (e.g. *Rose*)
    * If the suit is in the interest of the federal court, the court can strike the party, especially if it’s fraudulently joined
    * But non-diversity cannot be cured by changing the citizenship of existing parties
    * Example: you can get rid of a law firm from a suit but you can’t fire partners to change the citizenship
  * Expats
    * Expats are citizens of the United States who live abroad; therefore, they do not have citizenship in any of the States
    * If an expat is a party to a suit, diversity is destroyed because they are not domiciliaries of any of the states
    * If an expat is in a partnership, they destroy diversity
    * Armed services/incarcerated persons? Too complicated for this class
* Amount in Controversy
  * The amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000. If the amount is exactly $75k, it does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement
  * Claim Aggregation Rules
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against a given D - aggregation of amount in claims is allowed
      * Each part of the lawsuit must have SMJ
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * Rare exception - when the substantive nature of the claims makes them inseparable
    * When multiple P's have claims against a given D - no aggregation of their claims is allowed
      * However, see class-action rule below
    * When multiple Ps have claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * However, each P can aggregate multiple claims against one of the individual Ds
  * Class-Action Rules of Aggregation
    * When multiple Ps have claims against a given D - aggregation allowed where they are seeking to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common or undivided interest
    * Claims of the class members cannot be aggregated if their rights are “separate” rather than “joint” or “common”
    * One class representative’s claim must exceed $75,000 and the court will have supplemental jurisdiction over the claims that do not exceed $75k
* Alienage Jurisdiction - Extension of federal courts jurisdictions over controversies involving non-citizens
  * Common justifications
    * Mitigate local bias against foreigners by allowing them to remove such cases to federal courts
    * Argument claiming that to compel aliens to litigate in state court would be an affront to the sovereign nations from which they come
  * Alienage jurisdiction provided for in §1332(a). Available in two basic situations and not available in one key situation
    * Available in lawsuit between citizen of state and citizen of a foreign state: NY v. China. Also works: NY v. China + Italy + Nigeria
    * Available where domestic diversity is satisfied, with foreign states added on: NY + Myanmar v. PA + Nigeria
      * Nothing in the statute requires foreign citizens to be diverse from each other, so we could also have NY + Myanmar v. PA + Myanmar
    * What doesn’t work, somewhat counter intuitively, is: China v. Nigeria (Protecting non-citizens from local bias: does not exist for non-citizens vs. non-citizens )
    * Citizens subject to foreign state that is also domiciled in same state as opposing party is another exception under 1332(a)(2)

## Federal Question Jurisdiction

* Jurisdiction based on federal question comprise 70% of cases in federal court
* In the vast majority of federal question cases jurisdiction, there is no difficult question surrounding the presence of federal question jurisdiction under §1331
* A federal court can exercise SMJ whenever a case “arises under” the Constitution or a federal statute
  * Typically, it is unequivocally clear that there is federal arising under jurisdiction
  * State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims based on federal law (plenary SMJ unless federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction)
* "Well-pleaded" Complaint - Standard established in *Mottley*
  * A case arises under federal law only if it appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, even if federal law is likely to be determinative of the controversy
    * Part of the reason *Mottley* court introduced such a restrictive standard was out of concern that grant of federal question matter jurisdiction would overwhelm the courts
  * Shrinking the complaint to its "well-pleaded" essentials would exclude P's anticipation of what D might plead or speculation as to the subsequent course of the suit
  * What aspects of a particular claim can be said to "arise under" federal law
* The “Because Principle” - First articulated in *Smith*
  * *Smith* establishes that there are some cases involving state law claims that implicate federal question jurisdiction
  * "Because" test - federal law question is the centerpiece of the well-pleaded complaint because it explains the cause of action, rather than being an anticipatory claim of D’s defense
  * The federal law issue appears as the object of the “because” in the complaint. The plaintiffs say that you’re investing in these farm loan bonds, violating Missouri law; it’s illegal **because** it exceeded the powers of Congress to create this whole regulatory structure under Article 1
    * This is not an anticipated affirmative defense; it is an explanation of what constitutes the violation of the duty (i.e. the cause of action)
    * Holmes dissent - Federal jurisdiction should depend on whether federal law provides the remedy. Thus, claim resting on state law should not be subject to federal jurisdiction.
* *Merrell Dow* raises questions about the validity of *Smith*
  * Fails to provide clarity regarding when a lack of federal cause of action (if not in all cases) would defeat arising under jurisdiction, even if there is a federal interest in the case
  * Majority in case appears to align itself with Holmes' dissent in *Smith*. Does it overturn the decision?
    * Best way to view this post-Grable is that the conspicuous absence of a federal private right of action is indicative of lack of federal interest
  * Prof. Wolff also suspects that the principle articulated in Grable was part of the courts reasoning, as state negligence per se cases would have a dramatic impact on the federal courts if they could suddenly be heard
* Grable provides clarity
  * Supreme Court says federal court can hear case, and that Smith remains good law. Merrell Dow didn’t mean that no federal cause of action always equals no federal jurisdiction
  * Even if issue is dispositive and there is substantial federal interest, it must be asked if the claim could be entertained without disturbing congressionally approved balance between state and federal courts (i.e. it would lead to an influx of cases in similar class flowing into federal courts)
  * However, in Grable, there appears to be a logical tension between the idea that issue is of substantial federal interest (IRS collection methods) and that it won't also only affect a miniscule number of cases
* Following Grable, we can summarize 4 considerations needed:
  * Well-pleaded complaint (bright line rule)
  * Dispositive federal issue (claim turns upon interpretation of federal law issue)
  * Strong federal interests (implicated by resolution of federal law question)
  * Balance of federal/state responsibilities (The Division of Labor)

### Motley

Couple sues RR, claim arises out of settlement from train crash allowing them to ride for free. RR reneges, claiming federal statute prevents them from renewing the pass. SCOTUS concludes federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction because **"arises under" requires showing cause of action as source of question of constitution, rather than an anticipated defense. The plaintiff's "well pleaded complaint" must state that the defendant directly violated some provision of the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States**.

### Smith

D wants to invest in federal farm loan bonds under a federal act, but P shareholders say it can’t because it would be unconstitutional. Court says suit satisfies well-pleaded complaint rule. Federal interests at stake - would have been a blow to federal regulatory program if institutions couldn't invest. When the **federal law issue is the centerpiece of a case and questions constitutionality of a federal program, court says this makes SMJ appropriate**

### Merrell Dow

Ps from Scotland and Canada suing D, Merrell Dow, in Ohio. Claim related to mislabeling of pharmaceutical products, including violation of Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act. Ps file lawsuit in state court; D strategically removes to federal court on basis of federal question jurisdiction. Once in federal court, D files FNC motion. All parties to suit agree that there was no private cause of action for violation of federal statute (*negligence per se*). However, main issue is whether there is still §1331 jurisdiction. Circuit court applies standard from *Smith* and concludes there is no SMJ, primarily because there were several other theories of negligence in P's claims, thus not a dispositive federal issue. SCOTUS affirms, though reasoning muddies the standard. Essentially says, in the absence of a federal private right of action there is no federal interest, and thus there is no federal jurisdiction. Congressional intent as to whether there should be private remedy for federal law is important

### Grable & Sons v. Darue

Case involving land seizure by state to satisfy P's unpaid tax liability. Property is sold by state to D. P brings suit claiming D does not have proper title to land because seizure was invalid due to failure to provide adequate notice. D removes to federal court. Both district and circuit courts found lack of federal cause of action did not bar exercise of federal jurisdiction. Here, SCOTUS highlights exception to the brightline "well-pleaded complaint" rule used in *Merrell Dow*. Court holds that issue must be dispositive and a substantial federal policy interest as to the resolution of the issue, which is a reaffirmation of considerations found in *Smith*. However, court also asserts that **federal issue wil ultimately qualify for federal forum only if doing so is consistent with congressional judgement about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts under §1331**. Thus, there must always be an assessment of any potential disruptions in exercising federal jurisdiction. Court does not want, without clear indication of congress, a shift in the balance that would open up the floodgates and offset the intended balance in this division.

## Pendent, Ancillary and Supplemental Jurisdiction

* Whether the limited subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts precludes authority over additional claims between P and D or over 3rd parties that, standing alone, couldn’t be asserted in such tribunals
  * Practically, there will be complicated lawsuits, and for convenience, you’ll want to try them all at once
* Under Article III, court reads “cases and controversies” as very expansive: encompasses all parts of a lawsuit that fit together and from the same “controversy” even if there are separate claims
  * Statutory power not present federal common law grounded in Article III interpretation
  * There is no statutory provision for hearing non-diverse state claims in federal courts
  * Major question is how Article III treats these "mixed" claim cases
    * Basic answer in *Gibbs* - Since judicial power extends to "cases and controversies", and we have federal anchor claim, court can adjudicate similar state claims so closely related to anchor as to be part of same case/controversy
* When there is a jurisdictional challenge, you have to be prepared to account for every element of the litigation
  * Joinder - the way in which one is permitted to "put the lego pieces together" in a particular way in constructing a lawsuit. Are you allowed to put case together through the tools of the joinder rules?
  * Jurisdiction: there must be a claim that has original subject matter jurisdiction
  * Even if it makes convenient sense and meets joinder rules, SMJ may be lacking in some claim
* Two tests  for whether two claims are party of the same case or controversies
  1. Common Nucleus of operative facts - *Gibbs*
     * Invites an inquiry into the facts that comprise each of the claims in the mixed lawsuit
     * Asks about the facts underlying the two claims and whether the facts that overlap are: core, insofar as they are central to the claim as opposed to existing in the periphery; and operative, insofar as their resolution drives the outcome of the lawsuit, as opposed to atmospheric facts
       * An easier way to think about this is if the various claims are such that they would ordinarily be expected to be tried in a single judicial proceeding
     * If this test is satisfied, state claims in a mixed case are sufficiently related to anchor claims so as to be part of the same "controversy" in Article III, thus entirety of claims comprises one constitutional case
     * Importance of common nucleus of operative fact standard
       * Efficiency, constitutional authority, fairness
     * Still a matter of discretion as to whether court actually accepts case for adjudication. Discretionary factors include:
       * If anchor claim gets dismissed fairly early in lawsuit; if supplemental claims require court to decide complex or novel issues of state law; if state law claims predominate over federal law claims; exceptional circumstances
  1. Logical Relationship Test - *Moore*
     * Moore allows supplemental jurisdiction because there is a “logical relation” between the claims
     * Can be better understood as a matter of dependence
       * Whatever factual overlap exists, if the resolution of supplemental claim relies on the resolution of the anchor claim, then they can be heard under the same controversy
       * In order to decide the one claim, as a practical reality, we have to decide the other as well
* Additional Parties - *Kroger* and *Finley*
  * Statutory authorization - have it for general federal question jurisdiction, but what about supplemental?
    * Did not exist at time of *Gibbs* and *Kroger*
    * *Gibbs* ignored this, but *Kroger* recognized this and held that allowing exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in the case would have presented a statutory problem
      * Court does not want to permit parties to do indirectly that which has been "barred" by statute when done directly
      * "Barred", more specifically, can be understood as conflicting with congressionally approved jurisdictional policy
  * Finley was the impetus for 28 USC §1367
    * (a) - Affirmative authorization of supplemental jurisdiction to the limits of Article III §2 ("same case or controversy") except:
      * Other federal statute
      * (b) or (c)
    * (b) - Only applies where anchor claim based solely on diversity
      * No supplemental jurisdiction over claims by P against against persons joined under:
        * Rule 14 - Impleader Rule
        * Rule 19 - Necessary Party Rule
        * Rule 20 - Ordinary Joinder Rule
          * Glitch - Only applies to parties joined by P. This may allow one of multiple Ps to circumvent amount in controversy requirements
        * Rule 24 - Provision for Intervention
      * Counterclaims under Rule 13 are not excluded from supplemental jurisdiction when anchor claim is based on diversity
      * No supplemental jurisdiction over claims by persons joined under:
        * Rule 19 - Necessary Party Rule
        * Rule 24 - Provision for Intervention
    * (c) Discretionary Factors
      * Codifies discretionary factors in goods which may be good reason not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction

### *United Mine Workers v. Gibbs*

P unable to fulfill obligations in employment contract due to actions by D. He filed suit against D based on their violation of a federal statute (Labor Management Relations Act) and the claim in controversy is a state-law claim allegedly part of an unlawful conspiracy to “maliciously, wantonly and willfully” interfere with his contracts. Court says it makes sense to bring claims together in a single lawsuit; it would have been unfair to bring this claim in state court. Where there is a lawsuit involving claim with independent basis for federal SMJ, article 3 allows that any claims closely related to this "anchor claim" be litigated together as a matter of common sense. To determine this, court employs test which requires the **state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative facts**

### Moore v. NY Cotton Exchange

P brings federal anti-trust claim against D, D brings state counter-claim (Joinder Rule 13) alleging P stole pricing information which it used as the basis of its anti-trust accusations. Federal claim was dismissed on the merits, not for lack of jurisdiction. On the state-claim, court rules that if one party asserts federal anchor claim, and other party counter-claims with a state-law claim, the **court can exercise its discretion to hear the additional claim if the counter-claim arises from the same transaction or series of transactions such that they bear a logical relationship to one another**, even if the anchor claim is dismissed (unless dismissed for jurisdictional issues)

### Owen Equipment v. Kroger

P filed wrongful death action in federal court on diversity. D1 impleaded 3rd party (Rule 14), and P amends complaint to add impleaded D2 as new party. Original D1 got his case dismissed, so the only remaining parties were P v. D2 (with no diversity). Court holds that there is no supplemental jurisdiction; there is no complete diversity which **conflicts with express authority of 1332**. Additionally, no efficiency in jurisdictional exercise of a suit with only non-diverse parties when the proper forum is state court. Hypothetically, if D1 remained as defendant and impleaded D2, court might not strike down since it is defendant who is trying to get both claims heard in one court (would otherwise be inconvenience) and its not incompatible with 1332

### *Finley v. United States*

P was wife and mother of victims of a plane crash. She sued the FAA, which can only be sued in federal courts, as well as local entities (city of San Diego and SD Gas & Electric) with state claims. SCOTUS held that federal court lacked authority to assert jurisdiction over the state claims against the non-federal defendants. She would need to bring two separate suits. In doing this, SCOTUS was effectively inviting congress to act and provide express authorization

## Removal

* Right to Removal under §1441
  * Tool for D’s to remove case to federal court if it would have had original jurisdiction anyway, grounded in either §1331, §1332, or §1367
  * Challenge removal by motion to remand. Case not dismissed, simply sent back to state court
  * Where multiple Ds, all parties must consent to removal
  * Parties have 30 days to file motion to remand if grounds for challenging are something other than subject matter jurisdiction
  * Filing for removal on diversity grounds requires D satisfy plausibility standard in establishing scope of the damages meets amount in controversy requirements
    * May conflict with D's own interests, as he is basically setting the floor on damages that can be assessed against him at $75,000
  * Only Ds can remove. Ps are not allowed to remove, even if the D does something that leads the P to have a good reason to be in federal court
  * The removal motion needs a short and plain statement for basis of removal. Notice of removal has to spell out the basis for removal
  * If court issues order to remand, this decision is not reviewable with 2 exceptions:
    1. Court asserts reason for denying is something other than improper removal (i.e. too busy) - Can appeal via extraordinary writs in these cases
    1. Remands under discretionary provision of supplemental jurisdiction
