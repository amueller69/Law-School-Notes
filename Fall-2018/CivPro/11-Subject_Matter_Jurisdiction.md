# Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts

## In General

* Subject matter jurisdiction is the authority/power that a federal court has to hear certain cases
* There are two basic “species” of subject matter jurisdiction:
  * “Arising Under”: also known as “federal question” jurisdiction; this is when the claims in a case “arise under” federal oversight. This might occur when a claim comes up because of a federal law or constitutional issue.
  * “Diversity”: diversity jurisdiction is when all the defendants reside in different states from all the plaintiffs (complete diversity). There is also a requirement that the amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Grounded in article 3 of the constitution, which embodies the principle of enumerated powers. T
  * The powers that the federal government has in our federal-state system are supreme. Federal policy supersedes state policy when they clash
  * However, because our federal government is a limited government, the objects it can speak to are limited to what is provided in the Constitution
  * The judicial version of the enumerated powers doctrine is Article 3, which defines the powers of the judiciary. Matter of shaping scope and power of the federal judiciary
* Art III §2: The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority…
  * Controversies where the United States is a party
  * Controversies between two or more States
  * Between a State and citizens of another State
  * Between citizens of different states
  * Etc.
* Statute—there must also be statutory authority that allows courts to hear claims. Courts interpret the statutes narrowly, even though the terms are similar to those in the Constitution
  * 28 U.S.C. §1331. Federal Question: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States
  * 28 U.S.C. §1332. Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs
  * Narrow statutory interpretation prevents the district courts from being overwhelmed
* Unlike PJ analysis which was largely focused on constitutional issues, SMJ analysis mostly involves interpretation of statutes
* Can't simply waive it like a party can submit itself to the authority of a court with personal jurisdiction
* Sua Sponte: on its own motion
  * Courts have responsibility to address SMJ questions on its own (not just on motions raised by litigants)
  * Determination that it does not have SMJ nullifies all litigation

## Diversity Jurisdiction

* Diversity Requirements (governed by §1332(a)(1))
  * Complete diversity
  * Amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000
* Citizenship
  * Determining citizenship:
    * Individual - domicility defines citizenship
    * Corporations - Principal place of business (under *Hertz*, the “nerve center”) OR the state of incorporation
    * Partnership - assumes the diversity of its "members" (e.g. MLB in *Rose*)
  * When is citizenship determined?
    * At the time the lawsuit begins (time of filing), not at the time of the events that led to the lawsuit
      * Post-filing move by a party does not defeat diversity
    * Implication: can change citizenship before litigation, but changes in citizenship after a lawsuit has been initiated do not affect diversity
  * What if a suit could be diverse but a party’s citizenship destroys diversity? (e.g. *Rose*)
    * If the suit is in the interest of the federal court, the court can strike the party, especially if it’s fraudulently joined
    * But non-diversity cannot be cured by changing the citizenship of existing parties
    * Example: you can get rid of a law firm from a suit but you can’t fire partners to change the citizenship
  * Expats
    * Expats are citizens of the United States who live abroad; therefore, they do not have citizenship in any of the States
    * If an expat is a party to a suit, diversity is destroyed because they are not domiciliaries of any of the states
    * If an expat is in a partnership, they destroy diversity
    * Armed services/incarcerated persons? Too complicated for this class
* Amount in Controversy
  * The amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000. If the amount is exactly $75k, it does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement
  * Claim Aggregation Rules
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against a given D - aggregation of amount in claims is allowed
      * Each part of the lawsuit must have SMJ
    * When a given P is asserting multiple claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * Rare exception - when the substantive nature of the claims makes them inseparable
    * When multiple P's have claims against a given D - no aggregation of their claims is allowed
      * However, see class-action rule below
    * When multiple Ps have claims against multiple Ds - no aggregation allowed
      * However, each P can aggregate multiple claims against one of the individual Ds
  * Class-Action Rules of Aggregation
    * When multiple Ps have claims against a given D - aggregation allowed where they are seeking to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common or undivided interest
    * Claims of the class members cannot be aggregated if their rights are “separate” rather than “joint” or “common”
    * One class representative’s claim must exceed $75,000 and the court will have supplemental jurisdiction over the claims that do not exceed $75k
* Alienage Jurisdiction - Extension of federal courts jurisdictions over controversies involving non-citizens
  * Common justifications
    * Mitigate local bias against foreigners by allowing them to remove such cases to federal courts
    * Argument claiming that to compel aliens to litigate in state court would be an affront to the sovereign nations from which they come
  * Alienage jurisdiction provided for in §1332(a). Available in two basic situations and not available in one key situation
    * Available in lawsuit between citizen of state and citizen of a foreign state: NY v. China. Also works: NY v. China + Italy + Nigeria
    * Available where domestic diversity is satisfied, with foreign states added on: NY + Myanmar v. PA + Nigeria
      * Nothing in the statute requires foreign citizens to be diverse from each other, so we could also have NY + Myanmar v. PA + Myanmar
    * What doesn’t work, somewhat counter intuitively, is: China v. Nigeria (Protecting non-citizens from local bias: does not exist for non-citizens vs. non-citizens )
    * Citizens subject to foreign state that is also domiciled in same state as opposing party is another exception under 1332(a)(2)

## Federal Question Jurisdiction

* Jurisdiction based on federal question comprise 70% of cases in federal court
* In the vast majority of federal question cases jurisdiction, there is no difficult question surrounding the presence of federal question jurisdiction under §1331
* A federal court can exercise SMJ whenever a case “arises under” the Constitution or a federal statute
  * Typically, it is unequivocally clear that there is federal arising under jurisdiction
  * State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims based on federal law (plenary SMJ unless federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction)
* "Well-pleaded" Complaint - Standard established in *Mottley*
  * A case arises under federal law only if it appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, even if federal law is likely to be determinative of the controversy
    * Part of the reason *Mottley* court introduced such a restrictive standard was out of concern that grant of federal question matter jurisdiction would overwhelm the courts
  * Shrinking the complaint to its "well-pleaded" essentials would exclude P's anticipation of what D might plead or speculation as to the subsequent course of the suit
  * What aspects of a particular claim can be said to "arise under" federal law
* The “Because Principle” - First articulated in *Smith*
  * *Smith* establishes that there are some cases involving state law claims that implicate federal question jurisdiction
  * "Because" test - federal law question is the centerpiece of the well-pleaded complaint because it explains the cause of action, rather than being an anticipatory claim of D’s defense
  * The federal law issue appears as the object of the “because” in the complaint. The plaintiffs say that you’re investing in these farm loan bonds, violating Missouri law; it’s illegal **because** it exceeded the powers of Congress to create this whole regulatory structure under Article 1
    * This is not an anticipated affirmative defense; it is an explanation of what constitutes the violation of the duty (i.e. the cause of action)
    * Holmes dissent - Federal jurisdiction should depend on whether federal law provides the remedy. Thus, claim resting on state law should not be subject to federal jurisdiction.
* *Merrell Dow* raises questions about the validity of *Smith*
  * Fails to provide clarity regarding when a lack of federal cause of action (if not in all cases) would defeat arising under jurisdiction, even if there is a federal interest in the case
  * Majority in case appears to align itself with Holmes' dissent in *Smith*. Does it overturn the decision?
    * Best way to view this post-Grable is that the conspicuous absence of a federal private right of action is indicative of lack of federal interest
  * Prof. Wolff also suspects that the principle articulated in Grable was part of the courts reasoning, as state negligence per se cases would have a dramatic impact on the federal courts if they could suddenly be heard
* Grable provides clarity
  * Supreme Court says federal court can hear case, and that Smith remains good law. Merrell Dow didn’t mean that no federal cause of action always equals no federal jurisdiction
  * Even if issue is dispositive and there is substantial federal interest, it must be asked if the claim could be entertained without disturbing congressionally approved balance between state and federal courts (i.e. it would lead to an influx of cases in similar class flowing into federal courts)
  * However, in Grable, there appears to be a logical tension between the idea that issue is of substantial federal interest (IRS collection methods) and that it won't also only affect a miniscule number of cases
* Following Grable, we can summarize 4 considerations needed:
  * Well-pleaded complaint (bright line rule)
  * Dispositive federal issue (claim turns upon interpretation of federal law issue)
  * Strong federal interests (implicated by resolution of federal law question)
  * Balance of federal/state responsibilities (The Division of Labor)

### Motley

Couple sues RR, claim arises out of settlement from train crash allowing them to ride for free. RR reneges, claiming federal statute prevents them from renewing the pass. SCOTUS concludes federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction because **"arises under" requires showing cause of action as source of question of constitution, rather than an anticipated defense. The plaintiff's "well pleaded complaint" must state that the defendant directly violated some provision of the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States**.

### Smith

D wants to invest in federal farm loan bonds under a federal act, but P shareholders say it can’t because it would be unconstitutional. Court says suit satisfies well-pleaded complaint rule. Federal interests at stake - would have been a blow to federal regulatory program if institutions couldn't invest. When the **federal law issue is the centerpiece of a case and questions constitutionality of a federal program, court says this makes SMJ appropriate**

### Merrell Dow

Ps from Scotland and Canada suing D, Merrell Dow, in Ohio. Claim related to mislabeling of pharmaceutical products, including violation of Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act. Ps file lawsuit in state court; D strategically removes to federal court on basis of federal question jurisdiction. Once in federal court, D files FNC motion. All parties to suit agree that there was no private cause of action for violation of federal statute (*negligence per se*). However, main issue is whether there is still §1331 jurisdiction. Circuit court applies standard from *Smith* and concludes there is no SMJ, primarily because there were several other theories of negligence in P's claims, thus not a dispositive federal issue. SCOTUS affirms, though reasoning muddies the standard. Essentially says, in the absence of a federal private right of action there is no federal interest, and thus there is no federal jurisdiction. Congressional intent as to whether there should be private remedy for federal law is important

### Grable & Sons v. Darue

Case involving land seizure by state to satisfy P's unpaid tax liability. Property is sold by state to D. P brings suit claiming D does not have proper title to land because seizure was invalid due to failure to provide adequate notice. D removes to federal court. Both district and circuit courts found lack of federal cause of action did not bar exercise of federal jurisdiction. Here, SCOTUS highlights exception to the brightline "well-pleaded complaint" rule used in *Merrell Dow*. Court holds that issue must be dispositive and a substantial federal policy interest as to the resolution of the issue, which is a reaffirmation of considerations found in *Smith*. However, court also asserts that **federal issue wil ultimately qualify for federal forum only if doing so is consistent with congressional judgement about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts under §1331**. Thus, there must always be an assessment of any potential disruptions in exercising federal jurisdiction. Court does not want, without clear indication of congress, a shift in the balance that would open up the floodgates and offset the intended balance in this division.

## Pendent, Ancillary and Supplemental Jurisdiction

* Whether the limited subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts precludes authority over additional claims between P and D or over 3rd parties that, standing alone, couldn’t be asserted in such tribunals
  * Practically, there will be complicated lawsuits, and for convenience, you’ll want to try them all at once
* If you want to bring a suit where some claims have independent federal question and some don't
* When there is a jurisdictional challenge, you have to be prepared to account for every element of the litigation
  * Joinder:  Joinder is the way in which one is permitted to "put the lego pieces together" in a particular way in constructing a lawsuit. Are you allowed to put case together through the tools of the joinder rules?
  * Jurisdiction: there must be a claim that has original subject matter jurisdiction
  * Even if it makes convenient sense and meets joinder rules, SMJ may be lacking in some claim
* Under Article III, court reads “cases and controversies” as very expansive: encompasses all parts of a lawsuit that fit together and from the same “controversy” even if there are separate claims
  * Statutory power not present federal common law grounded in Article III interpretation
  * There is no statutory provision for hearing non-diverse state claims in federal courts
  * Major question is how Article III treats these "mixed" claim cases
* Two tests  for whether two claims are party of the same case or controversies
  1. Common Nucleus of operative facts - Gibbs
    * Asks about the facts underlying the two claims and whether the share facts of common and whether the constitute the core and whether operatively they work
