# Pleadings

* Historical Development
  * Traditional pleadings procedures were inherited from English common law writ system an were complicated
    * Procedural split based on the type of claim
    * War of pleadings - Every pleading was met with a responsive pleading until issues emerged in a form proper for jury consideration
  * Reforms in mid-19th century New York culminated in the "Field Code"
    * Aimed to merge into a single pleading procedure that would govern all claims
    * Helped eliminate "war on pleadings" problem by abandoning, as a function of the pleadings, the narrowing of case to a single issue through numerous rounds of responses
    * Required plain and concise statement of facts making up cause of action, but court adopted technical rules for enforcing this standard that dismissed cases for being either too detailed or conclusory
* Notice Pleadings Standard
  * Established by FRCP Rule 8, required a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief
  * Primary purpose is to make allegations to put defendant on notice so as to enable them to prepare a response
  * Also helps frame for court the range of issues being disputed in the case
  * Defendant simply needs enough to know allegations made against him for which relief is sought
    * More detailed information sought about pleader's contentions must be obtained through discovery
  * Gibson v. Conley established a "no set of facts" test to help explain the notice pleadings standard and which persisted for several decades. Under this interpretation, a plaintiff is entitled to an assumption of truth in its allegations unless no set of facts could satisfy the evidentiary burden. The defendant must show show one of the following:
    * Their are logical inconsistencies in the claims, such that two facts could not be mutually true
    * The claims are so divorced from reality that no conceivable set of facts could possibly support them
  * This was the standard until Twombly in 2007

## Twombly Standard

* \"[i]n\ practices, a complaint...must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory."
* Conclusory Allegations v. Allegation of Fact
  * Conclusory Allegations
    * A bare restatement of elements in the cause of action or an allegation made by inferences drawn from other allegations. These are not entitled to a presumption of truth at the pleadings stage
    * Example: Regional providers conspired to prevent competitive entry into the telecom markets
    * Doesnâ€™t mean that conclusory allegations should be ignored entirely. They may provide role in setting context for complaint's narrative and checking a box on an element of the cause of action. They just aren't sufficient on their own.
  * Allegations of Fact
    * Something that happened in the world. Assumed to be true at the pleadings stage.
    * Example: Representatives from the regional providers convened and entered an agreement not to compete outside their respective market.
  * A Primary task of court in determining if complain satisfies Twombly standard is to determine which claims are factual and which are conclusory.
* Plausibility Analysis
  * Examines relationship between factual allegations and conclusory ones
  * Court assumes the fact allegations to be true and looks at the conclusory allegations in the complaint's overall context to determine if the culpable inference is plausible based on the alleged facts
  * Though this isn't quite clear, for a culpable inference to be plausible, it must be, at a minimum, equally compelling as any other inference drawn from the same set of facts
  * Consequence is that it invites court to police what is plausible (i.e. what explanations of the facts is most likely) at the pleadings stage
* Justification for Standard
  * If plaintiff is permitted through pleadings stage without a claim that is strongly rooted in allegations of fact, they might be able to leverage expensive discovery process or sympathetic juries to benefit, either through settlement or judgement, despite bringing a "largely groundless claim"
  * Court must balance allowing groundless claims to "take up the time of a number of people" while scaring respondents into settlement  and the possibility of improperly dismissing meritable claims through an overly burdensome pleadings standard.

### *Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly*

Antitrust suit alleging regional telecom carriers were operating in restraint of trade by agreeing not to compete with each other and exclude other competitors. Court identifies the the essential question of law was whether there was agreement, tacit or express, between the carriers to engage in anti-competitive activities or if they were each acting independently in parallel. The complaint appears to satisfy the function of informing defendants of the claims. However, it does not reference any specific instances of the wrong doing. The complaint points out evidence that market is both structured in a way that supports the conclusion of operating to restrict trade and provides incentives for doing so. However, these are only allegations of parallel conduct and not of conspiracy. The Court finds that the bare allegations of conspiracy in this complaint are not allegations of fact, but conclusory allegations, thus not entitled to the presumption of truth. Court rejects prima facie interpretation of Conley, as such conclusory statements would survive pleadings stage if there was even a slight chance that discovery would reveal evidence supporting recovery. Instead, court requires that allegations of facts state claim that is plausible on its face. In light of the true "allegations of facts" pleaded in the case, the court ruled, the claim of conspiracy had not crossed the line from conceivable to plausible and should therefore be dismissed

### *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*

P allege that government perpetuated acts of illegal assault and torture against detainees on the basis religion and national origin. Allegations identify Ds as those responsible for architecting the policy and ordering its execution. Court references "flexible plausibility standard" in *Twombly* which where factual allegations must amplify claim where necessary to render it plausible. It identifies two principles from its *Twombly* decision: (1) the presumption of truth is inapplicable to conclusory statements and (2) only a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss, which is a context-specific determination the court is tasked with reviewing. Applying these standards, it determines that P's allegations about being subject to supervisory liability were mere legal conclusions and not entitled to a presumption of truth. Likewise, the plausibility analysis was left to the discretion of the court where it found the claim was a less plausible explanation of the allegation of facts than an explanation in which the policy's impact on specific religious groups or nationalities was simply incidental. Since the plausibility standard had not been satisfied, court remands CoA's decision to deny motion to dismiss complaint.

## Pleadings Motions

* Distinction between an answer and a motion to dismiss
  * Motion is not an affirmative defense, hence no assertions about what did/didn't happen. Only assertions on face of plaintiffs complaint.
  * Argument that plaintiff has not satisfied burden based on the inferences that can be drawn from allegations in the complaint.
* Rule 12 Motions
  * If you are going to raise a Rule 12 motion, you only have one opportunity to do so (with a few exceptions). If a party believes it has multiple grounds for dismissal, it needs to join them all together.
  * Failing to assert a specific defense when filing a Rule 12 motion results will likely result the waiver of that defense
  * Rule 12(b): Pre-answer motions for dismissal
    * Must be made before responsive pleadings
    * Among the defenses that can be asserted are lack of subject matter/personal jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and insufficient process.
  * Rule 12(c): Motion for judgement on the pleadings - At end of pleadings stage, either party can move for judgement based on what has been established in the pleadings. Challenge to the legal sufficiency of a complaint or an affirmative defense.
  * Rule 12(e): Motion for a more definite statement - If granted, court affirms that some language is too ambiguous or vague that a party can't prepare a reasonable response. Court orders amendment to the original complaint within 14 days or it may strike pleading.

## Amendments to Pleadings

* Rule 15(a) - Before Trial
  * A party allowed amend its pleadings once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving
  * An other amendments to pleadings must be done only with opposing party's written consent
* Court should "freely give leave" meaning it should be permissive with amendments unless it prejudices opposing party
* Relation Back
  * In adding a claim to a law suit, one must still satisfy statue of limitation.
  * Rule 15 holds that if a claim arose out of the same occurrence/transaction as did the original complaint, then the claim is timely if the original claim was timely.
  * If a claim would join new defendants, that party must be served process within the statute of limitation unless:
    * Genuine mistake identifying the proper party
    * Proper party knew or should have known the action would have been brought against it but for a mistake concerning proper party's identity
