# Summary Judgement

## *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*

**Facts**:
D files motion for summary judgement on grounds that there is no evidence in support of wrongful death claim. District court grants motion, reasoning that there was no showing D's product was linked to wrongful death. Court of Appeals holds that the summary judgement was defective because the motioning party made no effort and thus failed to produce evidence showing the absence of any issues of fact, citing FRCP Rule 56(e).

**Ruling**:
Supreme court rejects CoA's interpretation of Rule 56. It affirms rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgement after adequate amount of time for discovery if a party fails to sufficiently show an element essential to their claim. It also agrees that party seeking judgement bears initial responsibility for informing the court of the basis of its motion and identifying items in the record, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue. However, the court found do requirement, express or implied in Rule 56, for a party to make an affirmative evidentiary showing that would negate its opponent's claims. Instead, the portion of Rule 56(e) that is at issue was intended to prevent resistance of summary judgement by opposing parties who simply reference the pleadings and conclusory assertions.

**Ruling**:
