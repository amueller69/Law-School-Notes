# Summary Judgement

## Class Notes 10/2

* Defensive motions for summary judgement are far more prevalent and make up majority of case law, but offensive motions can and do occur
* If respondent believes discovery period has been inadequate when summary judgement is motioned for, Rule 56(d) allows respondent to move for additional time at court's discretion
* Purpose of summary judgement is to infer, from the record, whether a party could conduct a competent trial that a reasonable jury could find compelling.
  * Party must demonstrate that it can do so, but can't produce evidence in an admissable form
  * Celotex is concerned with the burden of the moving party in showing the absence of issues of material fact
  * In minority view, pointing out part of the record that demonstrates absence of factual basis for plaintiff's claim shifts burden on resisting party to show otherwise

## Class Notes 10/3

* Deferential Standard is to draw inferences most favorable to plaintiff
  * Neglected in Harris because Justice Scalia claims video resolves any dispute of facts
  * Weakening of the standard

## *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*

**Facts**:
D files motion for summary judgement on grounds that there is no evidence in support of wrongful death claim. District court grants motion, reasoning that there was no showing D's product was linked to wrongful death. Court of Appeals holds that the summary judgement was defective because the motioning party made no effort and thus failed to produce evidence showing the absence of any issues of fact, citing FRCP Rule 56(e).

**Ruling**:
Supreme court rejects CoA's interpretation of Rule 56. It affirms rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgement after adequate amount of time for discovery if a party fails to sufficiently show an element essential to their claim. It also agrees that party seeking judgement bears initial responsibility for informing the court of the basis of its motion and identifying items in the record, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue. However, the court found do requirement, express or implied in Rule 56, for a party to make an affirmative evidentiary showing that would negate its opponent's claims. Instead, the portion of Rule 56(e) that is at issue was intended to prevent resistance of summary judgement by opposing parties who simply reference the pleadings and conclusory assertions.

## Scott v. Harris

**Facts**:
P is paralyzed after he is involved in a car crash while attempting to flee police. The officer pursuing P caused the accident while attempting to immobilize the vehicle. Video evidence is presented and D moves for summary judgement based on qualified immunity. District Court denies motion for summary judgement, finding there are issues of material fact. CoA affirms District Court. Supreme Court grants certiorari.

**Ruling**:
