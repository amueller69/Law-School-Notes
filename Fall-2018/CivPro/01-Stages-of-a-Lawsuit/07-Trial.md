# Trial

## Class Notes 10/8

* "Right" to jury trial in civil actions derived from 7th Amendment, though only applies at federal level. States not obliged to guarantee civil trial by jury
  * Actions seeking equitable relief don't typically have this right extended to them
* **Pre-Trial Order**
  * Constructed in pretrial conference following discovery. Rule specifies the order can only be modified to avoid "manifest injustice" The reasoning behind this is to eliminate potential for a "trial-by-surprise"
* **Voir Dire**
  * Preemptory challenges used to strike jurors without cause. Alloted 3 of them. Important series of cases addressing use of these challenges for purposes that are discriminatory and that constitution deems inappropriate
    * Function is to challenge causes that are difficult to articulate
* Rule 50 Motion: Judgement awarded after party has ahd opportunity to present evidence, legal theories, and conclusion on grounds they have failed to establish sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find in their favor
  * Reason a JAML may be granted despite surviving summary judgement:
    * Key piece of evidence could not be put into admissible form. Body of evidence court scrutinizes is different from that presented at trial
      * Example: Witness recanting testimony
    * Evidence that was compelling on its face failed to withstand questioning at trial

* Can't infer temporal evidence from proximity evidence. There must be independent support for both elements of constructive knowledge. Must have sufficient time to exercise reasonable care.

* *Dixon*
  * One of the primary questions was that surrounding the evidence presented to the jury.
  * Walmart presented no evidence regarding source of the binding. Should this be viewed as:
    1. An absence of evidence supporting an alternative?
    1. Acceptance of plaintiff's theory?
  * Walmart instead presents procedures that, if adhered to, would have resulted in the prompt discovery and removal of the binding
    * Is it reasonable to believe this was an instance where employee(s)?
  * There is an unavoidable element of indeterminacy that, as a matter of social policy, might be best answered by a jury
    * In Dixon, appeals court made a unilateral decision to override jury decision based on a set of assumptions it used to conclude P's theory was unreasonable, raising questions.

* Reason for denying Rule 50(a) but granting Rule 50(b)?
  * Pg. 714
