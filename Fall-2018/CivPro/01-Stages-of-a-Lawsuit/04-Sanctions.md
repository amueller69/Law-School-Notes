# Sanctions and Obligations of Counsel

## Rule 11

* Sets a standard of reasonableness and effort that is exercised in paper filings submitted to court
  * This includes briefs, motions, pleadings, etc.
  * These paper filings must be signed by at least one attorney of record
  * Exception: discovery stage, which is governed by its own rules
  * Exception: things that aren’t papers submitted to the court (personal letters, etc.)
* **Rule 11(b) - Representations to Court**
  * Requirement to proceed with competence and good faith. One must make arguments/paper filings that meet a certain threshold of professionalism. Arguments that knowingly/negligently misstate the law/controlling authority may be found to be an affirmative misrepresentation to the court, which is sanctionable under Rule 11(b).
  * By signing/submitting filing to court, attorney is certifying that to the best of its knowledge, following reasonable inquiry, the filing:
    1. Is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or delay
    1. Contains claims/contentions warranted by existing law or non-frivolous arguments to extend law
    1. Factual contentions have some evidentiary support and denials are reasonably based on belief or lack of knowledge (i.e. not directly lying to the court or making up facts)
  * This is so lawyers don’t misrepresent the law or facts, either purposefully or through their own incompetence
  * Relationship with Rule 12: Balance between specificity of allegations necessary to satisfy pleadings standards and the certainty of the allegations made in good faith. A party can't simply make up details that aren't grounded in material fact
* **Rule 11(c) - Sanctions**
  * 11(c)(2) - Motion for sanctions must be made separately from other motions and must identify the conduct in violation. Opposing party must be given opportunity to withdraw offering document before opposing party can file sanctions motion (21 days)
  * 11(c)(3) - Court can also initiate sanctions on its own and provide party with opportunity to show cause as to why its conduct has not violated Rule 11(b)
  * 11(c)(4) - Purpose of sanctions is to deter sanctionable conduct, not punishment or compensation
    * No Jackpot rule: Professional impact of sanctions are damaging enough
  * Either the party's attorney or a party itself can be sanctioned, depending on who was responsible for the violation
    * Assumption is that the attorney is responsible, though still possible for a party to be sanctioned
    * Non-delegatable duty to investigate. Attorney cannot blindly rely on client assertions if independent corroboration is readily available
    * Rule 11(b)(2) is an exception, as monetary damages for frivolous suit falls entirely on the attorne

### *Christian v. Mattel*

Party in suit motions for sanctions, contending that the opposing party brought frivolous action. TC grants it and orders sanctioned party, under Rule 11, to pay for other party's attorney fees. CoA reviews decision for abuse of discretion. **Courts ability to sanction attorney conduct under Rule 11 does not extend to discovery abuses or misstatements made to court during an oral presentation**. While CoA finds no abuse of discretion, it can't conclude for certain that granting of actions by TC was on the basis of conduct falling under the scope Rule 11, as opposed to improper conduct outside of paper filings. Thus, CoA remands to give TC an opportunity to delineate the basis for its imposing of sanctions.

### *Revson v. Cinque & Cinque*

Attorney for party (P) sent an aggressive letter to get client files from D, who previously represented P in lawsuit but was dismissed after dispute over fees. At one point in the letter, P's attorney threatens to perform the legal equivalent of a “proctology exam” and disrupt D's business with other clients, among other things. Dispute eventually leads to litigation where the lower court imposed sanctions on P's attorney not P, since the attorney represented to the court that he was responsible for litigation decisions and strategy. Additionally, the sanctions imposed by lower court did not fall under Rule 11, since the conduct was not part of any filing, but court's inherent authority under statute. CoA reviewed decision and held that, even though behavior is distasteful, it’s not sanctionable under the circumstances. The conduct, despite being obnoxious and malicious, had some merit based on the context (need to quick receipt of files, D's performance as an attorney being at issue in the case, etc.)
