# Sanctions and Obligations of Counsel

## Class Notes 9/21

* Rule 11
  * Sets a standard of reasonableness and effort that is exercised in paper filings submitted to court
  * Rule 11(b) : Requirement to proceed with competence and good faith. One must make arguments/paper filings that meet a certain threshold of professionalism. Arguments that knowingly/negligently misstate the law/controlling authority may be found to be an affirmative misrepresentation to the court, which is sanctionable under Rule 11(b).
  * Rule 11(b) relationship with Rule 12: Balance between specificity of allegations necessary to satisfy pleadings standards and the certainty of the allegations made in good faith. A party can't simply make up details that aren't grounded in material fact
  * Rule 11(c)(2) - Party must be given opportunity to withdraw offering document before opposing party can file sanctions motion court can still initiate sanctions itself
* Sanctions
  * Purpose of sanctions is to deter sanctionable conduct
  * Purpose of sanctions is not punishment, nor is it compensatory
    * No Jackpot rule: Professional impact of sanctions are damaging enough
  * Either the party's attorney or a party itself can be sanctioned, depending on who was responsible for the violation
    * Assumption is that the attorney is responsible, though still possible for a party to be sanctioned
    * Non-delegatable duty to investigate. Attorney cannot blindly rely on client assertions if independent corroboration is readily available
    * Rule 11(b)(2) is an exception, as monetary damages for frivolous suit falls entirely on the attorney
