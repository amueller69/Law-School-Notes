# Pleadings

* Notice Pleadings Standard
  * Established by FRCP Rule 8, it replaced the Field Code which was inherited from English common law writ system
  * Purpose is to make allegations to put defendant on notice so as to evoke a response
  * Defendant simply needs enough to know allegations made against him for which relief is sought
  * Gibson v. Conley established a "no set of facts" test to help explain the notice pleadings standard and which persisted for several decades. Under this interpretation, a plaintiff is entitled to an assumption of truth in its allegations unless no set of facts could satisfy the evidentiary burden. The defendant must show show one of the following:
    * Their are logical inconsistencies in the claims, such that two facts could not be mutually true
    * The claims are so divorced from reality that no conceivable set of facts could possibly support them
