# Appeals

## Class Notes

* Circuit courts can usually only hear final ruling. This is baseline assumptions: all proceedings must come to an end meaning intermediate contentions may be precluded from immediate appeal. This comes at aa cost, as court rulings at intermediate stages of litigation have significant impact. Party must continue costly litigation.
* Benefits:
  * No constant interruption of litigation timeline
  * Allows full development of facts that may weigh on legal question at issue
* Exceptions
  * Collateral order
  * Interlocutory
  * Extraordinary writs
* Collateral Order
  * Case represents broader set of important values. The issues are distinct from the merit of the lawsuit. VAlue of review would expire if not done immediately
    * Example: Qualified immunity being improperly denied
* Extraordinary Writ:
* Interlocutory Appeals - Two Avenues
  1. Section 1292(a) Request for injunctive relief
     * Most expansive review as failure to immediately grant injunctions lead to significant/irreparable consequences to party
  1. Section 1292(b) Discretionary appeals
     * Order involves a "controlling question of the law": as to which there are "substantial grounds for difference in opinion" and which would materially advance resolution of the litigation
     * Trial court has discretion over whether this section is applicable to the question, and if so, the CoA has discretion to take for appeal.
       * Neither decision is reviewable
* Rule 54(b) gives court power to issue a partial judgement if it deems so to be in the interest of justice provides final judgement for an issue in the litigation, allowing appeal to be raised without awaiting final judgement on remaining litigation
* Prevailing party doctrine: Appeal not available for those awarded all sought after relief
* Why winners appeal:
  1. Could have adverse fact findings tha could impact party
  1. Could establish precedent unfavorable in future litigation

### Standards of Review

* De Novo
  * No formal deferential to lower court. Usually applied to questions of law without any weight to lower court's ruling.
* Clearly Erroneous
  * Usually reserved to finding of facts if CoA has "definite and firm conviction" of a mistake
* Abuse of Discretion
  * Review of legal rulings involving balance of factors left to discretion of trial judge. Standard is that CoA should not substitute its judgement unless the balancing of the factors falls outside the boundaries of reasonableness
* Clearly erroneous and abuse of discretion standards of review only applies to findings or rulings of judges, as 7th amendment protects against reexamining jury decisions

* 5th Circuit- "Because the issue was the ultimate issue in the case, it can be subject to de novo review and not subject to standard of deference"
  * Supreme Court rejects this and finds 5th Circuit didn't adequately apply clearly erroneous standard
    * Marshall's dissent: disagrees with this finding, arguing that while CoA's conclusions were a bit too broad, they nonetheless clearly articulated its application of the clearly erroneous standard as supported by the record
