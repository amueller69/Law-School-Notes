# Discovery

* Discovery process in modern litigation
  * Consensus exists that the more parties know, the better
  * A party can still prevail even if proof of the claim/defense is in the possession of an opponent or an uncooperative non-party. However, discovery is still dependent on cooperation and good faith relations between parties
  * Courts not particularly interested in resolving discovery disputes. Onces parameters are set through reasonable negotiations, they will leave parties to it
    * "Parameters" are typically contemplating during Rule 26(f) pretrial conferences and outlined in the discovery plan. This includes time, subject matter, disclosure, and privilege parameters
    * Role of court varies, though the court is invited by the rules to play an active managerial role in discovery planning and help guide towards the possibility of settlement
  * Mechanism established under Rules 26 and 37 are a significant shift from predecessor in which such inquiry was burdensome
    * The pre-trial functions of issue-formulation and fact-revelation had previously been performed (inadequately, one might note) by the pleadings. New rules limit function of pleads to general notice giving
    * The shift provided discovery with a vital role in trial preparation, helping narrow/clarify basic issues and ascertain both facts and information about the existence/whereabouts of facts

## Required Disclosures

* Initial Disclosures
  * The requirement for initial disclosures was strengthened significantly in 2000
  * Under Rule 26(a)(1), a party must produce certain information at the outset of litigation without awaiting a discovery request
    1. List of all persons likely to have discoverable information, but only those to be used be disclosing party. There is no obligation to identify parties that are not relied on by the disclosing party
    1. A copy, or description/location, of documents and electronically stored information that disclosing party possesses and may use in its claim
  * Must be made within 14 days of Rule 26(f) conference unless a party objects to the appropriateness of initial disclosures, at which point a new timeline will be set when the court rules on the objection
  * A party must produce information reasonably available to it. It is not excused from making disclosures because it has not investigated
* Expert Testimony
  * Under Rule 26(a)(2), a party must inform each other about any expert witnesses they intend to call at trial
  * Includes providing the identity of the retained expert accompanied by a written report containing:
    * A statement about the opinions the witness will express and basis of the reasoning
    * facts or data considered in forming the opinions and exhibits that wil be used to support them
    * witnesses qualifications/credentials and any other cases in which similar testimony was provided

## Adversarial Discovery

* Rule 26(b) relates to the scope of discovery. There is both a broad standard of relevance applied to discoverable information as well as a proportionality standard
  * Relevance Standard
    * The information is relevant to any claim or defense
    * Typically applied very broadly
  * Proportionality Standard
    * Balance test between burden to disclosing party and benefit to requesting party
    * Takes into consideration: Issues and damages at stake, cost and time needed to obtain discovery, and other opportunities available to the requesting party
    * Burden to show proportionality now falls on the requesting party, a shift in the burden which had traditionally fallen on disclosing party
    * Cost/Benefit assessment for discovery has been employed to apply proportionality standard
* Responsive Documents
  * A term of art referring to things that fall under scope of what plaintiff asked for in a request
    * Gold standard is to bring in third party to determine and apply scope to documents
* Procedures to Block and Compel Discovery
  * Objections
    * Refusal to produce requested information offered in lieu of a response
    * Places the burden of judicial intervention on the party seeking discovery, though the basis for the objection must be stated
    * In depositions, testimony is taken subject to objection unless privilege is being asserted
  * In asserting privilege by withholding certain protected information, a party must notify the requesting party
    * Notice must contain sufficient amount of detail so as to explain the basis for the privilege
    * This allows the requesting party to contend opposing party's exercise of privilege
  * Rule 37(a) Motion to Compel
    * Requesting party can challenge objection. If court finds the objection was unfounded, it will order a response and award the moving party attorney fees in making the motion
  * Protective Orders
    * Refusing party can preemptively seek judicial intervention under Rule 26(c) to prevent or limit the scope of an intervention
    * Requires showing of good cause
      * Example: The discovery sought would disclose proprietary information which would put the disclosing party at a disadvantage
  * Sanctions
    * Rule 37(b) and 37(d) provides sanctions for parties who fail to make disclosures or act in good faith
    * In addition to these sanctions, the damage to a party's credibility resulting from such conduct will make it difficult to advocate for it's client in subsequent stages of the litigation
* Discovery Devices
  * Rule 33 Interrogatories
    * Can only be served to parties of litigation and allowed maximum 25 total questions
    * Answers to interrogatories must be given after reasonable investigation, "I don't know" is not an adequate response
    * Allows probe into opponents legal theories or evidentiary support
      * Not objectionable merely because it asks for opinion or contention related to a fact or application of the law
    * Limited insofar as follow up responses are not normally possible
  * Rule 30 Depositions
    * Examinations of a witness under oath, recorder for possible later use in the proceedings
    * Any person with relevant information can be deposed and any party can attend a deposition
    * Advantage over interrogatories is that they allow for follow up questioning
    * Limitation of these is that deponent has no obligation to prepare or follow up, they can simply defer if they don't have a response
  * Rule 34 Requests for Production
    * Permits party to inspect/copy documents or other tangible evidence within another party's control/custody
    * Preserving the order/location/state of documents is an obligation because it is important metadata
      * Can reveal information about who knew/was responsible which isn't present in the documents themselves
    * Often occurs in several rounds as production of documents reveals more information about other available discoveries
  * Rule 35 Mental and Physical Examinations
    * Unlike other devices, these exams require a prior court order "for good cause shown." This is due to their highly invasive nature
    * To show good cause, one must affirmatively show that the condition being sought for examination is genuinely in controversy
      * A movant cannot simply rely on the contents of the pleadings or conclusory allegations, though they aren't required to go as far as proving their case on the merits
      * Court may hold evidentiary hearing, though it isn't necessary in all cases
    * Consequences
      * Party who moved for exam must, upon request, provide copy of examiner's report along with all other like reports on the same condition
      * If examined party requests examiner's report, they must, upon request, provide moving party with any other like reports of the same condition
  * Rule 36 Requests for Admissions
    * The ministerial version involves the authentication of documents
    * The more substantial version involves requests that your opponent admit facts, application of law to facts, or opinions about either two
    * Responding party is under a duty of reasonable inquiry to determine the truth of each, though this may be advantageous in some ways (see section on prior adjudication)
    * Financial incentive to admit - If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and the requesting party later proves the matter on there own, they can move that the requestee pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof. This does not apply to requests that were deemed to be inappropriate or where there are reasonable grounds for the party's failure to admit
  * Other Devices
    * Stipulations
      * Parties can choose to enter written agreement in which they consent to treat certain facts as true in their dispute
      * This can save unnecessary time and expenses
      * Courts generally hold such stipulation agreements as binding for the purposes of the litigation
    * eDiscovery
      * Computerized information is discoverable as a matter of black letter law
      * Subject to the same rules and scope as other discoverable information, such as the proportionality and relevance standards

## Privilege

* Privileged communications are protected from disclosure
  * It represents a sacrifice of the accuracy of adjudication in order to encourage/facilitate certain relationships
  * Attorney has obligation to take action on what client tells him, so long as the substance of the communication is not disclosed
  * Attorney-client privilege only applies to communication between attorney and client. If shared with third party, the privilege is destroyed
* Justification for privilege
  * Theory is that client would not be completely candid with her attorney if she feared that her discussion would later be revealed against here wishes
  * Privilege prevents a client from self-censoring discussions with attorney out of a potentially incorrect understanding of the legal implications of the truth. In order to provide effective advice, attorney must be armed with all of the facts
  * It also helps attorney prevent client from presenting inaccurate information to the court
* Waiver of privilege
  * Can be waived either deliberately or inadvertently
  * In doing so, a party is waiving protection to **all** related subject matter
  * Parties can form binding agreements that inadvertent disclosure of privileged information will not result in waiver. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) also does this to an extent.

## Work Product

* Work Product
  * Rule 26(b)(3) recognizes presumption of privilege for materials prepared in anticipation of litigation (i.e. work product) unless:
    1. They are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1)
    2. AND the requesting party has shown there is substantial need for the materials in order to prepare for case
    3. AND the materials (or their equivalent) can't be obtained without hardship
  * Even if the aforementioned criteria are shown, Rule 26(b)(3)(B) may nonetheless protect certain information
    * Rule states that court shall protect against disclosure of mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal theories of a party's attorney
  * Testimony from experts not being retained is considered work product and not subject to required disclosure
  * Work Product Protection <> Privilege
    * It simply places a limit on what is discoverable
    * Some states don't enforce this protection as broadly
  * Justifications
    * Historically speaking, lawyer is officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while protecting rightful interests of their client. In performing these duties, it is essential a lawyer is able to work with certain degree of privacy and free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing party. Proper preparation requires an attorney to sift through facts and prepare theories without needless and undue interference

**Facts**:
P suing D after a tug owned by D P sunk while helping to tow a car float, resulting in the death of five crew members. D hires law firm in anticipation of lawsuit from relatives of deceased crew members and privately interviews survivors. After a claim is filed by P, several interrogatories were filed, including one that inquired into the communication D had with survivors and a request for any statements made. D's representation declined this on grounds that it requested privileged material?? Trial ordered D them to comply. Upon appeal, CoA reversed judgement asserting that information was part of the lawyer's work product and thus privileged under FRCP.

**Ruling**:
Supreme court recognized the function of discovery under rule 26 calls for narrow application of the "privileged" limitation on discoverable materials. Since  the information at issue was obtained by D's representation from a third-party, it is not protected by attorney client privilege and P's request is properly discoverable. However, court also identifies that the information sought by P is readily available and could be obtained without any hardship. Further, no attempt has been made by P to show that the information sought is of substantial need and D's failure to produce would prejudice their preparation. Hence, the attempt to obtain work product **without* justification falls outside the boundaries of discovery under Rule 26. The CoA's judgement is affirmed by the court.
