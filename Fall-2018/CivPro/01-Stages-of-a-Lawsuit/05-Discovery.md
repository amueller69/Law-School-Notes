# Discovery

* Discovery process in modern litigation
  * Consensus exists that the more parties know, the better
  * A party can still prevail even if proof of the claim/defense is in the possession of an opponent or an uncooperative non-party
  * Courts not particularly interested in resolving discovery disputes. Onces parameters are set through reasonable negotiations, they will leave parties to it
  * Mechanism established under Rules 26 and 37 are a significant shift from predecessor in which such inquiry was burdensome
    * The shift provided discovery with a vital role in trial preparation that had previously been belonged to pleadings stage

## Work Product

* Work Product
  * Rule 26(b)(3) recognizes presumption of privilege for materials prepared in anticipation of litigation (i.e. work product) unless:
    1. They are otherwise discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1)
    2. AND the requesting party has shown there is substantial need for the materials in order to prepare for case
    3. AND the materials (or their equivalent) can't be obtained without hardship

### *Hickman v. Taylor*

**Facts**:
P suing D after a tug owned bD P sunk while helping to tow a car float, resulting in the death of five crew members. D hires law firm in anticipation of lawsuit from relatives of deceased crew members and privately interviews survivors. After a claim is filed by P, several interrogatories were filed, including one that inquired into the communication D had with survivors and a request for any statements made. D's representation declined this on grounds that it requested privileged material?? Trial ordered D them to comply. Upon appeal, CoA reversed judgement asserting that information was part of the lawyer's work product and thus privileged under FRCP.

**Ruling**:
Supreme court recognized the function of discovery under rule 26 calls for narrow application of the "privileged" limitation on discoverable materials. Since  the information at issue was obtained by D's representation from a third-party, it is not protected by attorney client privilege and P's request is properly discoverable. However, court also identifies that the information sought by P is readily available and could be obtained without any hardship. Further, no attempt has been made by P to show that the information sought is of substantial need and D's failure to produce would prejudice their preparation. Hence, the attempt to obtain work product without justification falls outside the boundaries of discovery under Rule 26. Hence the CoA's judgement is affirmed.
