# Personal Jurisdiction

* Two constitutional provisions are relevant here
  1. Full Faith and Credit Clause Article IV, Section 1 - Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial proceedings in every other state
     * Compels enforcement of one state's judicial proceedings in other state, but does not require out-of-state enforcement if determined the court issuing judgement lacked jurisdiction over the defendant
  1. Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment - No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law
     * Has been used to prohibit excessive assertions of jurisdiction by state courts

## Traditional Bases of Jurisdiction

### Power Over Person and Property

* In rem - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction in relation to property within its borders
* In personam - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction over a person within its borders
* Quasi in rem - Courts jurisdiction over the interests of particular parties in a thing
* Pennoyer Court identifies two principles of law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property
  * Dependent on property physically residing in forum state and may or may not be
  1. Every State possess exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. Thus, it has power to govern property, contractual relationships, etc.
  1. No State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons aor property without its territory. States are independent and equal in authority/dignity, thus implying the exclusion of power from all others within its territory.
* Summons is formal mechanism by which court attaches its power over the defendant. It is akin to the service process in English common law in which an officer might be sent to physically compel ("put hands on") the respondent to answer. Sending an officer into CA to drag the defendant back to OR would clearly be an encroachment of the police powers held by CA over its territory.
  * Problem with this view - It effectively bars actions against residents of other states, allowing some to easily evade law suits.
* Historical relevance and context behind this theory of jurisdiction
* Though modern approach has changed substantially, this demonstrates the evolution of the court's jurisdiction doctrine and some important considerations about legal authority in the federal court system.
* Pennoyer was heard during period of reconstruction following the Civil war. This provided an opportunity for the court to address issues state sovereignty and property rights that were in-flux.
* Raising Jurisdictional Objections
* If D believes jurisdiction over him is improper:
  * He can decline to appear and a default judgement will be entered. Such objections can be raised at proceedings to enforce judgement. Can also bring collateral suit to reclaim property, though risky.
  * Make special appearance to sole purpose of contesting jurisdiction
  * Can defend on the merits and still preserve right to appellate review of jursdictional objection.

#### *Pennoyer v. Neff*

Landmark case that represents the Supreme Court's initial effort to develop a conceptual framework for allocating adjudicatory authority among the states. It unfolded in thee separate proceedings.

##### Proceeding 1 - Mitchell v. Neff

Mitchell files suit against Neff in Oregon state court for unpaid attorney’s fees, less than $300. Mitchell publishes
notice in Pacific Christian Advocate, a local publication, as a substitute for traditional service of process. This is consistent with OR state law after failed attempts to locate D (though the adequacy of this type of notice and obtaining jurisdiction becomes an important issue). At this point, Neff is now a resident of California and is physically present there. Neff fails to respond and doesn’t show up to lawsuit, so court enters default judgment for nearly $300, but no way to execute judgement since D is nowhere to be found.

##### Proceeding 2 - Sheriff's Sale

Mitchell knew that D owned property in state valued around $15,000. He goes to Sheriff seeking judgement enforcement action by attaching this property. This property is auctioned off, with Mitchell himself being the winning bidder. Since proceeds of sale used to pay judgement, Mitchell gets back the money he paid in addition for the land. He then sells the land to a 3rd party, Pennoyer.

##### Proceeding 3 - Neff v. Pennoyer

After some time, Neff, unaware of both the judgement and subsequent auction, finds out Pennoyer is occupying the land and brings action for ejectment. The question of law for the court was whether Pennoyer's title to the land was valid due to the legitimacy of the judgement of of the first proceeding. Since Neff was a CA domiciliary at the time of filing the suit and his only relation to OR is with the plot of land he owns. However, Oregon court found there was personal jurisdiction over Neff for a different reason: state laws allowed Mitchell to use Neff’s property as proxy for his person. This is the concept of "quasi in rem" jurisdiction, exercise of jurisdiction over property, but where the lawsuit is not about the property itself but just using the property as a proxy. Thus, Oregon court held the initial judgement was valid.

##### Supreme Court Decision

Supreme Court ruled that the exercise over the defendant in the first proceeding was invalid because the property, which was used as a proxy for jurisdiction, was not attached at the outset of the lawsuit; it was only attached afterwards when seeking enforcement of the judgement. Court found that the failure to do so was a violation of due process. Attaching property when exercising in rem jurisdiction is necessary for court to be properly constituted and attachment is treated as the formal step in which court attaches power (functional equivalent of serving process in personam jurisdiction). Thus, Supreme Court holds default judgement was rendered without proper jurisdiction.

### Domicility and Consent

* Domicility
  * According to power theory, a state would not be unable to exercise jurisdiction over an individual outside of its boundaries, even if the individual is domiciled in that state.
  * Supreme Court held in Milken v. Meyer that responsibilities of citizenship arise of the relationship with state with which one is domiciled in and that these responsibilities simply don't dissolve because of someones physical absence from that state. Continuous presence is not necessary
* Consent
  * Individual voluntarily submitting themselves before the jurisdiction of a court, either implicitly or through some express act (e.g. choice of forum clause, voluntary appearance, etc.)
  * After Pennoyer, several decisions trying to work around the strictness set by the power theory

#### *Hess v. Pawloski*

P suffered injuries on highway in Massachusetts from D, who is driving through from PA. MA enacts law acknowledging that objections to personal jurisdiction can be waived; thus if you drive on the roads of MA, you will be deemed to have designated the secretary of state of MA to be your agent and you implicitly consent to MA’s jurisdiction (Service of summons on agent in MA, who then delivers it to D). Under Pennoyer, since MA does not have property or person of defendant, it shouldn’t be able to assert jurisdiction. Supreme Court rules that this does not conflict with due process, noting that driving is a dangerous activity and states need to control dangerous activity that happens on their roads and could theoretically exclude that activity altogether if they chose.

### Out-of-State Corporations Under Traditional Theories of Personal Jurisdiction

* A domestic corporation, seen analogous to an individual domiciliary, was subject to jurisdiction in the state of its corporation, regardless where service was made
  * PJ over subject based on location the service was made presented difficulties because corporations had no physical presence
  * Courts forced to consider alternative measures

## Modern Two-Step Analysis: Minimum Contacts and Reasonableness

### Minimum Contacts Standard

* Formally affirmed by court in Intl Shoe, representing a sharp break from principles in Pennoyer
  * Pennoyer was a rules-based system, centered around principle of State sovereignty, with legal fiction workarounds to achieve sensible outcomes
  * Intl Shoe: standards-based paradigm that measures activity against notions of fairness and justice
    * Malleable and flexible, considers burdens and activities of D with benefits/privileges gained from forum which lead to obligations
* Fairness Analysis
  * Looks at “quality and nature” of defendant’s in-state activities. Is there a substantive relationship between defendant’s in-state contacts and what defendant is being sued over? D's contacts in state can't simply be incidental to the cause of action.
  * World Wide Volkswagen expands on the type of factors considered: [1] the burden on the defendant; [2] the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; [3] the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; [4] interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; [5] the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies
* Quid Pro Quo Element
  * Insofar as defendant enjoys benefits and protections of state, and insofar as plaintiff is suing about those specific activities then there is a concomitant obligation to be liable to suit in state

#### *International Shoe Co. v. Washington*

D has incorporated in DE. It has deliberately conducted its business activities in such a way to limit the states that can assert jurisdiction over it (e.g. no offices/storage of merchandise, f.o.b. shipping, etc). Washington sues for failure to contribute to unemployment fund under statute. Fundamental question of law: whether D, consistent with the limitations of the due process clause, has made itself amenable to proceedings in WA by its activities in the state. State of WA Supreme court held the continuous flow of its products into state was sufficient to constitute "doing business" so as to make it amenable to suit in WA. U.S Supreme court affirms, holding that activities in forum State established “sufficient minimum contacts” that do not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice in asserting personal jurisdiction. Looking at the quality of the in-state activity, court found they were regular and systematic, resulting in large volume of business through which D received benefits and protections of WA laws. These contacts, when balanced with the inconveniences that would result from holding D amenable to suit, were sufficient enough for court to find that jurisdiction would not be unreasonable or violate due process.

### Specific-Act Statutes

* Any question of personal jurisdiction typically involves:
  1. Is there a statutory grant of personal jurisdiction under state law that authorizes this proposed exercise of jurisdiction?
     * Specific-act-statues: State enacted statute that authorizes jurisdiction over nonresident defendants where the claim arose from certain in-state acts
     * "Sky’s the limit" statute: State authorizes that effectively authorizes all jurisdiction within constitutional boundaries
  1. Are there due process consequences?
     * Why are we so concerned about D's rights, especially to the detriment of P's interest? Because the defendant is the one who is being subjected to coercive power of court and is at risk of being deprived of rights

#### McGee v. International Life Insurance

California has a specific statute that authorizes personal jurisdiction. Mother of decedent sues in California, obtains a default judgment when the defendant refuses to appear, and tries to collect on the default judgment in Texas. Insurance company argues that CA courts had no jurisdiction. TX courts deny enforcement of the judgement. Supreme court holds D, an insurance company in TX, established sufficient minimum contacts to California forum with single insurance contract. Court recognizes state's has strong interest in protecting citizens and the need to expand the scope due to a modernizing economy. Court rules that California court did have personal jurisdiction.

#### Gray v. American Radiator

Lawsuit brought in courts of IL, involves PA and OH. P purchases hot water heater in IL sold by D, a company located in PA. But the company uses components from many places, included from Titan Valve located in OH. So, a valve is manufactured in OH, sent to PA where it is incorporated into water heater, and then sent to IL for sale. Ms. Gray is injured by the water heater. She sues American Radiator which impleads Titan Valve.The IL Supreme Court finds that Titan Valve is indeed suable in IL, ruling jurisdiction is authorized by an interpretation of IL product liability statute and not in violation of due process. Court says this is a foreseeable exercise of jurisdiction, because the product wound up in IL through a predictable chain of transactions ("stream of commerce"). The court infers that this isn’t the only Titan Valve valve ending up in IL, which means Titan Valve is enjoying many of the benefits of IL’s market. Therefore, it is fair that it should respond to lawsuit in IL in order to satisfy the obligations that come along with accessing that market

### Purposeful Act Requirement

* Purposeful Availment - An act by which D purposefully avails itself of privilege of conducting activities within a state, thus invoking benefits/protection of its laws
  * Essential to satisfy requirement of contact with state
  * D manifests some intent to specifically do business with market/individuals within a state
  * Boundaries of purposefulness extended to area where D intends to do business. Any proliferation outside those boundaries is the result of independent decisions by 3rd party actors
* Forseeability
  * Majority in WWVW hold that it has never, by itself, been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under due process.
  * Interpretation relevant to due process inquiry - Not the mere likelihood a product will make way into a state, but that D's conduct/contacts are such that he should anticipate being "hauled into court" in that state (Volkswagen)
* Multi-step inquiry following WWVW:
  1. How purposeful is the defendant’s connection to the forum state?
  1. In the particular facts of the case, do fairness factors point to or away from exercising jurisdiction?
  * The litany of “even-if’s”: even if all these fairness factors point to jurisdiction, the court thinks that due process clause "acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment"

#### *Hanson v. Denckla*

Hanson, Mother living in PA uses DE estate company to set up a trust. She subsequently moves to FL and executes action that gives trust estate to divide it equally among 3 daughters. Two daughters bring action in FL claiming change to trust was invalid. Declaratory judgement affirming validity issued in DE while FL court held it was invalid. Question: is the DE trust administrator suable in FL over a dispute concerning the trust? Court holds FL does not have jurisdiction because the single act of moving to FL was unilateral decision of consumer, not DE trust. DE trust did not execute purposeful availment of FL laws, nor does it satisfy requirement of intentionality and purposeful contacts with the forum.

#### *Worldwide Volkswagen v. Woodson*

D is regional distributor that serves tristate area of NY, NJ, and CT. Seaway is the local dealership in NY. P buys car in NY when living there from the dealership. While driving through OK en route to AZ, Ps were involved in crash. Defect with vehicle results in serious injury. Ps brings suit in OK state court claiming defective gas tank design caused fire. Issue: since car is driven to OK, does that support personal jurisdiction in that state? Court draws on Hanson: we require not just contact between forum and defendant’s activities, but that contact is a purposeful one manifesting intent of defendants to do business specifically with customers or markets in that state. Court acknowledges that if sale arises from the efforts of the manufacturer/distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in a state, then it is not unreasonable to subject it to a suit in that state. However, this was clearly not the case in D's relationship with OK. D's product entering OK was the result of a unilateral act by P. In the absence of that showing of intent/purpose, a key component of jurisdictional showing fails.

## Tort vs. Contract cases (class notes omitted)

* Different character to the nature of the dispute in a contract, when everything is discussed in advance
  * Opportunity for forum and choice of law clauses
  * Merely entering into a contract in another state is usually insufficient for establishing minimum contacts
* Products liability cases have a lower standard of purposeful availment than intentional tort cases
* *Burger King v. Rudzewicz (1985)*: contract case - P with principal business in FL enter into franchise contract with D for BK restaurant in MI. P brings suit in FL – contract had choice of law clause for FL and was a 20-year contract
  * HOLDING: D’s actions purposefully directed toward the forum State because the contract had substantial connections with the State
    1. Contract formed in FL, choice of law clause in FL, other negotiations couldn’t be done in MI
    1. Not unreasonable because D had reason to know about the forum
    1. Though it was a single contract, particularities led it to be sufficient contacts: 20-year relationship, constant payments, choice of law clause
  * Where reasonableness factors are met convincingly, personal jurisdiction may be granted upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts
* *Calder v. Jones (1984)*: intentional tort case – P brought suit against D National Enquirer author and editor in CA, and their principal place of business is FL.
  * HOLDING: Defendants’ intentional conduct in and to California establish minimum contacts for specific jurisdiction
    1. Story was about CA, they knew it would sell papers in CA, effects of tort felt in CA/Hollywood, research and interviews conducted in CA
    q. Tort expressly aimed at the forum itself, not just P in forum
* Express Aim and Targeting Standard
  * The Calder Doctrine: Effects must be felt by the forum State and not just a person in the forum State for intentional tort cases
  * Griffins v. Liban: Minnesota archaeologist defames AL archaeologist online, insufficient connection to the forum State because statements weren’t expressly aimed at AL itself, regardless whether D knew victim would feel effects in AL
* Walden v. Fiore (2014): intentional tort case – P brought suit against D for confiscating money in GA airport while they were en route to NV (residents of CA/NV). 
  * HOLDING: D’s conduct was not a substantial connection to the forum State and actions were not attached to NV in any meaningful way
  * From Calder: minimum contacts analysis looks to contacts with forum State itself, not contacts with persons who reside there
  * Steps away from the idea that plaintiff’s contacts with forum State allow a lesser showing of minimum contacts
* *Asahi v. Superior Court of California (1987)*: ∆ Japanese component manufacturer sells product to π Taiwanese, who incorporate it into a product known to be sold in CA. ∆ component causes crash in CA. CA man sues π end-use manufacturer, who sues ∆ component manufacturer. Majority denies personal jurisdiction on reasoning of “fairness.”
  * Is ∆’s knowledge that a “stream of commerce” would bring their product to CA sufficient contacts?  
    1. O’Connor Four: Simply placing a product in the stream of commerce, with knowledge of its ultimate consumption, is insufficient (rejection of Gray). “Something more” in addition to stream of commerce that demonstrates purposeful targeting of the state (Ex: advertising/marketing, sales agents, specialty designs, exclusive end-use manufactures). “Stream of Commerce +”
    1. Brennan Four: If ∆ is fully aware that his product is being sold in CA, then act of placing product within the “stream of commerce” is sufficient contacts for specific jurisdiction because the possibility of lawsuit for a defective product cannot come as a surprise (acceptance of Gray).
  * Court agrees that jurisdiction would be “unfair” by 5-part WWVW test:
    1. Burden on ∆: high considering unfamiliarity with U.S. law and inconvenience
    1. Interest of forum state: no clear interest; lawsuit became an indemnification between two Asian companies.
    1. P interest: no clear reason π wants to sue ∆ in CA.
    1. Interaction between contacts test and fairness test?
    1. Per Asahi, reasonableness factors can overwhelm contacts factors, in either direction. 
* J. *McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro (2011)*: π NJ resident sues ∆ UK manufacturer in NJ for production of a shearing machine that malfunctioned. ∆ ships machine to exclusive distributor in Ohio, which then delivers its products throughout the USA. 4 machines, including the defect, end up in NJ. ∆ CEO attends trade shows in USA. 
  * HOLDING: Majority finds no jurisdiction, plurality reasoning
    * Ginsburg Dissent: meets Asahi O’Connor test –
      1. Contacts sufficient:
         * In addition to placing product in “stream of commerce” the company benefits from and avails itself to any state for the purposes of specific jurisdiction for the defects of its products in the state
      1. Reasonableness satisfied
    * Breyer Concurrence: Asahi not satisfied here
      1. Contacts insufficient:
         * The purposeful targeting required in the “something more” test must be directed at the forum state; cannot infer purposeful targeting of USA to an individual state. A volume of business could show purposeful targeting of NJ, but not enough in record (only 4) to prove purposeful targeting of NJ
    * Kennedy Majority: return to Pennoyer principals
      * Focuses on power and consent. Equates purposeful availment with consent. PJ requires forum-by-forum analysis
      * Allows foreign companies to formally set up their business so as to be invulnerable to specific jurisdiction outside of their PPOB. Not about contacts with other states that afford specific jurisdiction; only ∆ consent purposefully avails of those other states. International Shoe rejected this practice through a reasonableness standard
