# Personal Jurisdiction

* Two constitutional provisions are relevant here
  1. Full Faith and Credit Clause Article IV, Section 1 - Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial proceedings in every other state
     * Compels enforcement of one state's judicial proceedings in other state, but does not require out-of-state enforcement if determined the court issuing judgement lacked jurisdiction over the defendant
  1. Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment - No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law
     * Has been used to prohibit excessive assertions of jurisdiction by state courts
* Specific vs General Jurisdiction
  * **General** - Category where court has decided entity is under its jurisdiction for **any** claim. No need to show relation between claim D's presence in the state
  * 2 main forms of general jurisdiction
    1. State where they are domiciled
    1. Tag jurisdiction: Physically served process within state boundaries. Constitutionality valid exercise of personal jurisdiction
  * **Specific**: claim in which plaintiff is seeking jurisdiction over D arises out of, or relates to, D's contacts or activities in a state. Since general jurisdiction is only available in narrow set of circumstances, specific jurisdiction is typically exercised when suing out-of-state corporation.

## Traditional Bases of Jurisdiction

### Power Over Person and Property

* In rem - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction in relation to property within its borders
* In personam - Courts power to exercise jurisdiction over a person within its borders
* Quasi in rem - Courts jurisdiction over the interests of particular parties in a thing
* Pennoyer Court identifies two principles of law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property
  * Dependent on property physically residing in forum state and may or may not be
  1. Every State possess exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. Thus, it has power to govern property, contractual relationships, etc.
  1. No State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons aor property without its territory. States are independent and equal in authority/dignity, thus implying the exclusion of power from all others within its territory.
* Summons is formal mechanism by which court attaches its power over the defendant. It is akin to the service process in English common law in which an officer might be sent to physically compel ("put hands on") the respondent to answer. Sending an officer into CA to drag the defendant back to OR would clearly be an encroachment of the police powers held by CA over its territory.
  * Problem with this view - It effectively bars actions against residents of other states, allowing some to easily evade law suits.
* Historical relevance and context behind this theory of jurisdiction
* Though modern approach has changed substantially, this demonstrates the evolution of the court's jurisdiction doctrine and some important considerations about legal authority in the federal court system.
* Pennoyer was heard during period of reconstruction following the Civil war. This provided an opportunity for the court to address issues state sovereignty and property rights that were in-flux.
* Raising Jurisdictional Objections
* If D believes jurisdiction over him is improper:
  * He can decline to appear and a default judgement will be entered. Such objections can be raised at proceedings to enforce judgement. Can also bring collateral suit to reclaim property, though risky.
  * Make special appearance to sole purpose of contesting jurisdiction
  * Can defend on the merits and still preserve right to appellate review of jursdictional objection.

#### *Pennoyer v. Neff*

Landmark case that represents the Supreme Court's initial effort to develop a conceptual framework for allocating adjudicatory authority among the states. It unfolded in thee separate proceedings.

##### Proceeding 1 - Mitchell v. Neff

Mitchell files suit against Neff in Oregon state court for unpaid attorney’s fees, less than $300. Mitchell publishes
notice in Pacific Christian Advocate, a local publication, as a substitute for traditional service of process. This is consistent with OR state law after failed attempts to locate D (though the adequacy of this type of notice and obtaining jurisdiction becomes an important issue). At this point, Neff is now a resident of California and is physically present there. Neff fails to respond and doesn’t show up to lawsuit, so court enters default judgment for nearly $300, but no way to execute judgement since D is nowhere to be found.

##### Proceeding 2 - Sheriff's Sale

Mitchell knew that D owned property in state valued around $15,000. He goes to Sheriff seeking judgement enforcement action by attaching this property. This property is auctioned off, with Mitchell himself being the winning bidder. Since proceeds of sale used to pay judgement, Mitchell gets back the money he paid in addition for the land. He then sells the land to a 3rd party, Pennoyer.

##### Proceeding 3 - Neff v. Pennoyer

After some time, Neff, unaware of both the judgement and subsequent auction, finds out Pennoyer is occupying the land and brings action for ejectment. The question of law for the court was whether Pennoyer's title to the land was valid due to the legitimacy of the judgement of of the first proceeding. Since Neff was a CA domiciliary at the time of filing the suit and his only relation to OR is with the plot of land he owns. However, Oregon court found there was personal jurisdiction over Neff for a different reason: state laws allowed Mitchell to use Neff’s property as proxy for his person. This is the concept of "quasi in rem" jurisdiction, exercise of jurisdiction over property, but where the lawsuit is not about the property itself but just using the property as a proxy. Thus, Oregon court held the initial judgement was valid.

##### Supreme Court Decision

Supreme Court ruled that the exercise over the defendant in the first proceeding was invalid because the property, which was used as a proxy for jurisdiction, was not attached at the outset of the lawsuit; it was only attached afterwards when seeking enforcement of the judgement. Court found that the failure to do so was a violation of due process. Attaching property when exercising in rem jurisdiction is necessary for court to be properly constituted and attachment is treated as the formal step in which court attaches power (functional equivalent of serving process in personam jurisdiction). Thus, Supreme Court holds default judgement was rendered without proper jurisdiction.

### Domicility and Consent

* Domicility
  * According to power theory, a state would not be unable to exercise jurisdiction over an individual outside of its boundaries, even if the individual is domiciled in that state.
  * Supreme Court held in Milken v. Meyer that responsibilities of citizenship arise of the relationship with state with which one is domiciled in and that these responsibilities simply don't dissolve because of someones physical absence from that state. Continuous presence is not necessary
* Consent
  * Individual voluntarily submitting themselves before the jurisdiction of a court, either implicitly or through some express act (e.g. choice of forum clause, voluntary appearance, etc.)
  * After Pennoyer, several decisions trying to work around the strictness set by the power theory

#### *Hess v. Pawloski*

P suffered injuries on highway in Massachusetts from D, who is driving through from PA. MA enacts law acknowledging that objections to personal jurisdiction can be waived; thus if you drive on the roads of MA, you will be deemed to have designated the secretary of state of MA to be your agent and you implicitly consent to MA’s jurisdiction (Service of summons on agent in MA, who then delivers it to D). Under Pennoyer, since MA does not have property or person of defendant, it shouldn’t be able to assert jurisdiction. Supreme Court rules that this does not conflict with due process, noting that driving is a dangerous activity and states need to control dangerous activity that happens on their roads and could theoretically exclude that activity altogether if they chose.

### Out-of-State Corporations Under Traditional Theories of Personal Jurisdiction

* A domestic corporation, seen analogous to an individual domiciliary, was subject to jurisdiction in the state of its corporation, regardless where service was made
  * PJ over subject based on location the service was made presented difficulties because corporations had no physical presence
  * Courts forced to consider alternative measures

---

## Minimum Contacts Standard - The Expansion of Personal Jurisdiction

### Minimum Contacts Standard

* **Has D established sufficient contacts or ties with the state of the forum to make it reasonable and just, according to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice, to permit the state to enforce the obligations which they have incurred there.**
* Formally affirmed by court in Intl Shoe, representing a sharp break from principles in Pennoyer
  * Pennoyer was a rules-based system, centered around principle of State sovereignty, with legal fiction workarounds to achieve sensible outcomes
  * Intl Shoe: standards-based paradigm that measures activity against notions of fairness and justice
    * Malleable and flexible, considers burdens and activities of D with benefits/privileges gained from forum which lead to obligations
* Fairness Analysis
  * Looks at “quality and nature” of defendant’s in-state activities. Is there a substantive relationship between defendant’s in-state contacts and what defendant is being sued over? D's contacts in state can't simply be incidental to the cause of action.
  * World Wide Volkswagen expands on the type of factors considered: [1] the burden on the defendant; [2] the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; [3] the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; [4] interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; [5] the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies
* Quid Pro Quo Element
  * Insofar as defendant enjoys benefits and protections of state, and insofar as plaintiff is suing about those specific activities then there is a concomitant obligation to be liable to suit in state

#### *International Shoe Co. v. Washington*

D has incorporated in DE. It has deliberately conducted its business activities in such a way to limit the states that can assert jurisdiction over it (e.g. no offices/storage of merchandise, f.o.b. shipping, etc). Washington sues for failure to contribute to unemployment fund under statute. Fundamental question of law: whether D, consistent with the limitations of the due process clause, has made itself amenable to proceedings in WA by its activities in the state. State of WA Supreme court held the continuous flow of its products into state was sufficient to constitute "doing business" so as to make it amenable to suit in WA. U.S Supreme court affirms, holding that **activities in forum State established “sufficient minimum contacts” that do not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice in asserting personal jurisdiction**. Looking at the quality of the in-state activity, court found they were regular and systematic, resulting in large volume of business through which D received benefits and protections of WA laws. These contacts, when balanced with the inconveniences that would result from holding D amenable to suit, were sufficient enough for court to find that jurisdiction would not be unreasonable or violate due process.

### Specific-Act Statutes

* Any question of personal jurisdiction typically involves:
  1. Is there a statutory grant of personal jurisdiction under state law that authorizes this proposed exercise of jurisdiction?
     * Specific-act-statues: State enacted statute that authorizes jurisdiction over nonresident defendants where the claim arose from certain in-state acts
     * "Sky’s the limit" statute: State authorizes that effectively authorizes all jurisdiction within constitutional boundaries
  1. Are there due process consequences?
     * Why are we so concerned about D's rights, especially to the detriment of P's interest? Because the defendant is the one who is being subjected to coercive power of court and is at risk of being deprived of rights

#### *McGee v. International Life Insurance*

California has a specific statute that authorizes personal jurisdiction. Mother of decedent sues in California, obtains a default judgment when the defendant refuses to appear, and tries to collect on the default judgment in Texas. Insurance company argues that CA courts had no jurisdiction. TX courts deny enforcement of the judgement. Supreme court holds D, an insurance company in TX, established sufficient minimum contacts to California forum with single insurance contract. Court recognizes state's has strong interest in protecting citizens and the need to expand the scope due to a modernizing economy. Court rules that California court did have personal jurisdiction.

#### *Gray v. American Radiator*

Lawsuit brought in courts of IL, involves PA and OH. P purchases hot water heater in IL sold by D, a company located in PA. But the company uses components from many places, included from Titan Valve located in OH. So, a valve is manufactured in OH, sent to PA where it is incorporated into water heater, and then sent to IL for sale. Ms. Gray is injured by the water heater. She sues American Radiator which impleads Titan Valve.The IL Supreme Court finds that Titan Valve is indeed suable in IL, ruling jurisdiction is authorized by an interpretation of IL product liability statute and not in violation of due process. Court says this is a foreseeable exercise of jurisdiction, because the product wound up in IL through a predictable chain of transactions ("stream of commerce"). The court infers that this isn’t the only Titan Valve valve ending up in IL, which means Titan Valve is enjoying many of the benefits of IL’s market. Therefore, it is fair that it should respond to lawsuit in IL in order to satisfy the obligations that come along with accessing that market

## Supreme Court Imposes Limits: Purposeful Act Requirement

### Purposeful Act

* Purposeful Availment - An act by which D purposefully avails itself of privilege of conducting activities within a state, thus invoking benefits/protection of its laws
  * Essential to satisfy requirement of contact with state
  * D manifests some intent to specifically do business with market/individuals within a state
  * Boundaries of purposefulness extended to area where D intends to do business
    * "[T]he sale...is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its products in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States" - WWVW
    * Any proliferation outside those boundaries is the result of independent decisions by 3rd party actors
* Forseeability
  * Majority in WWVW hold that it has never, by itself, been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under due process.
  * Interpretation relevant to due process inquiry - Not the mere likelihood a product will make way into a state, but that D's conduct/contacts are such that he should anticipate being "hauled into court" in that state (Volkswagen)
    * This is unclear and may be circular
  * Forseeability, as part of the stream-of-commerce doctrine, was the basis of Brennan's concurrence in *Asahi*. This was rejected both in O'Connor's opinion and later on in *Nicastro*, which asserts actions, not expectations, empower state to exercise jurisdiction.
* Multi-step inquiry following WWVW:
  1. How purposeful is the defendant’s connection to the forum state? Has it sufficiently availed itself?
  1. In the particular facts of the case, do fairness factors point to or away from exercising jurisdiction?
  * The litany of “even-if’s”: even if all these fairness factors point to jurisdiction, the court thinks that due process clause "acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment"

#### *Hanson v. Denckla*

Hanson, Mother living in PA uses DE estate company to set up a trust. She subsequently moves to FL and executes action that gives trust estate to divide it equally among 3 daughters. Two daughters bring action in FL claiming change to trust was invalid. Declaratory judgement affirming validity issued in DE while FL court held it was invalid. Question: is the DE trust administrator suable in FL over a dispute concerning the trust? Court holds FL does not have jurisdiction because the single act of moving to FL was unilateral decision of consumer, not DE trust. DE trust did not execute purposeful availment of FL laws, nor does it satisfy requirement of intentionality and purposeful contacts with the forum.

#### *Worldwide Volkswagen v. Woodson*

D is regional distributor that serves tristate area of NY, NJ, and CT. Seaway is the local dealership in NY. P buys car in NY when living there from the dealership. While driving through OK en route to AZ, Ps were involved in crash. Defect with vehicle results in serious injury. Ps brings suit in OK state court claiming defective gas tank design caused fire. Issue: since car is driven to OK, does that support personal jurisdiction in that state? Court draws on Hanson: we require not just contact between forum and defendant’s activities, but that contact is a purposeful one manifesting intent of defendants to do business specifically with customers or markets in that state. Court acknowledges that if sale arises from the efforts of the manufacturer/distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in a state, then it is not unreasonable to subject it to a suit in that state. However, this was clearly not the case in D's relationship with OK. D's product entering OK was the result of a unilateral act by P. In the absence of that showing of intent/purpose, a key component of jurisdictional showing fails.

#### *Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of CA*

P was injured and his wife killed when they crashed their motorcycle due to a tire blowout. P filed a product liability suit over the defective tire against Taiwanese tire maker in CA state court. Tire maker filed a cross-complaint for indemnification against D. All other claims were dismissed or settled. D moved to quash the summons for lack of PJ. D manufactured valve assemblies in Japan and tire manufacturer bought over 100,000 units annually to incorporate into the tires is sold worldwide CA accounted for 20 percent of tire company's sales in the United States. CA Supreme Court reversed and invalidated writ that CoA had issued TC ordering quashing of the summons. Court applies two-step inquiry: were there purposeful contacts and would exercise of PJ be reasonable under fairness factors identified in *WWVW*? "O'Connor 4" holds that mere knowledge/awareness that product has entered the stream of commerce in forum state is insufficient. There needs to be more: conduct purposefully directed at the forum state and/or showing intent or purpose to serve that market. Exercise of jurisdiction would also fail the reasonable determination, as it is extremely burdensome and the state has little interest. "Brennan 4" argues that if D is fully aware that his product is being sold in CA, then act of placing product within the “stream of commerce” is sufficient contacts for specific jurisdiction because the possibility of lawsuit for a defective product cannot come as a surprise (acceptance of Gray).

### Intentional Torts Context

* Cases involving personal jurisdiction across different contexts (e.g. contracts, intentional torts, etc.) can be viewed as applying a shared set of principles
  * Some paradigms in a specific context might not translate to another context due to differences in the nature of the disputes
* What is distinctive about intentional torts?
  * Generally, allegations in an intentional tort case features D's deliberate contact or connection with P who claims to be injured
  * Contrasted with *Gray*, where manufacturer/dealer had no direct connection with the injured consumer or *WWVW*, where D's connection was only in selling the car
  * However, while intentional contact is standard used to establish PJ in product liability, this might not be sufficient in intentional torts cases
* Effects Test and Express Aiming
  * Contacts with the state have to be purposeful. If you’re **deliberately causing effects within state** of CA, that makes out for a strong case of personal jurisdiction. That’s why *Calder* is sometimes described as articulating an “effects” test.
  * *Calder* is often described as an “express targeting”or “express aiming” case. Writer/editor aimed not just at person in CA, but a person who was involved with the CA industry; the CA industry was a target in a sense because that was the profitable thing to write about.
  * Court expands on this effects test in *Walden v. Fiore*, holding D's suit related conduct must create substantial connection with forum state. It must arise of contacts D himself creates with the state and looks to D's contacts with the forum State itself, not D's contacts with persons who reside there. It held that **the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and forum**. Jurisdiction is based off of D's connections without regard to nature or depth of P's connections to forum state.
* *Griffis* and TV *Azteca* both apply rule that **it’s not enough that you defame someone knowing that they live in the state**

#### *Calder v. Jones*

P lived in CA. D, a national newspaper based in FL, decides to do story about P and her husband. D and its distributor get sued for libel; writer and editor of D also get sued. The two individuals live and work in FL, where D is headquartered and incorporated. Writer travels to CA periodically on business and reporting. For this story he made telephone calls to sources in CA, as well as read the story to P's husband for comments. Editor had been to CA twice, once on vacation and once for an unrelated proceeding. Can P sue not just the newspaper and distributor, who admitted personal jurisdiction existed in CA, but also the writer and editor as individuals? Court rejects 1st amendment defense, as this is accounted for outside the jurisdictional analysis. Court asserts article concerned a CA resident, was drawn from CA sources, impugned P's professional career which was centered in a CA industry, and caused harm (emotional and to professional reputation) the brunt of which was suffered in CA. Court affirms individual Ds' contention that their contacts should not be judged by their employers activities in a state, but this doesn't insulate them from being liable from their individual activities arising out of their employment. Individual D's knew this is state where P lived/worked and where its newspaper had the largest circulation, giving them reason to "anticipate being haled into court there". Thus, court holds jurisdiction over individual D's is proper on this basis.

### Contracts Context

* In the context of contracts with parties domiciled in another state, court considers nature of the obligations, levels of continuous communication, etc.
  * Looks at terms to determine if contracting non-resident has sufficiently "purposefully availed" itself in the privileges provided by a forum state
  * Unfortunately, the activities identified in Burger King doesn't provide us with an idea of the minimum threshold needed for "purposefulness"
* Choice-of-forum clause - Provides that if there is a lawsuit between the parties pursuant to this contract, it will happened in a predetermined forum. This provides jurisdiction in a place where it would otherwise not be authorized, as both parties have consented in advance.
* Choice-of-law clause - Governs the substantive law of a state that a court will use to decide a lawsuit. Effectively determines which state's law of contracts court uses to settle a dispute
* Two-step inquiry in *Burger King*, similar to *WWVW*
  1. Show contacts in state which are purposeful
  1. Consider fairness factors and weigh them against contacts
     * Same factors identified in *WWVW*
     * If the fairness factors are quite strong, then that might justify exercise of personal jurisdiction on slightly less demanding showing of purposeful contacts with state
     * > These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required

#### *Burger King v. Rudzewicz*

P with principal business in FL enter into franchise contract with D for BK restaurant in MI. Contract deals with startup costs and procedures in exchange for right to sell BK products, for a period of 20 years. This contract requires a high level of engagement from both parties on an ongoing basis. After D fails to make royalty payments, P brings suit in FL - contract had choice-of-law clause for FL. D contends that FL court has no PJ of them, as agreeing to choice-of-law clause is sufficient. Court applies minimum contacts test to determine if there was "substantial contact" with forum state and then considers the contacts in light of fairness related factors. Although D had no ties to FL and did not maintain any FL offices, he deliberately negotiated with representatives outside MI and finalized a deal with a corporation he knew was located in FL. Choice-of-law clause reinforces the deliberate affiliation with the state, as D purposefully availed himself of the benefits of FL's laws by entering contract that would be governed by those laws. Thus, court reversed lower court's ruling that PJ had not been established in FL.

## Contemporary Specific Jurisdiction

* Potentially signals paradigm shift in personal jurisdiction back towards those based around sovereign authority.
  * Fairness principles adopted to address issues of the formalistic approach to PJ that allowed corporate defendants to shield themselves from being pulled into court, as demonstrated in *Intl Shoe*
  * Defendant in *Nicastro* operates by similar strategy in the international context. Shields itself from being subject to jurisdiction in any particular state by directing all of its activity at a single distributor
  * Return to the principles of sovereignty in *Nicastro* make this strategy successful and perhaps lays out blueprint for foreign corporations to take advantage of US markets while still shielding itself from any liability

### *J. McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro*

#### Factual Background

NJ resident P became seriously injured while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured in the UK by D. D ships machine to exclusive distributor in OH, which then delivers its products throughout the US.  NJ supreme court found that, even though D never marketed its goods in the state nor shipped them there, NJ courts had jurisdiction over the company because the manufacturer knew or should have reasonably known that its products were distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead their products being sold in any of the 50 states, including New Jersey. D appealed.

#### Kennedy Opinion

Supreme court identifies "purposeful availment" as the governing rule and asserts the "stream-of-commerce" doctrine can't displace it. O'Connor's opinion in *Asahi* stating actions, not expectations, **empower** state to exercise jurisdiction should be the controlling standard. **Personal jurisdiction requires a sovereign-by-sovereign analysis of whether the conduct was directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of the forum so that the sovereign hs the power to to subject D to judgement concerning that act.** At no time did D engage in activities in the state of NJ that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. Instead, marketing and sales efforts were directed at the US in general, no to a specfic state.

#### Ginsberg Dissent

Act was in fact purposefully directed - its goal was to see its products sold in as many states as possible with no states excluded. Further, McIntyre UK deliberately took steps to see that products entered different states, namely by retaining a distributor. The plurality seems to be holding that by directing activity at US as a whole, a foreign entity can elude jurisdiction in individual states. It is unfair that P has no recourse in any state. *International Shoe* made clear that the legal fictions of "presence" and "implied consent" should be discarded, though plurality appears to be abandoning fairness principles in favor of a showing of D's intent to submit to authority of the state.

---

## General Jurisdiction

* Describes circumstances where plaintiff asserts personal jurisdiction is obtainable in forum state for any claim because there is something about the nature of D's relationship with that state
  * Can only be satisfied in narrow set of circumstances
  * General jurisdiction determination performs inquiry into state of affairs at the time the action is brought, not the time in which the events on which the claim is based ocurred
* "Doing Business": Follows from the functional equivalent of "presence" that gives state personal jurisdiction over persons under power theory or tag jurisdiction
  * Systematic and continuous commercial activity, in the Pennoyer era, became legal fiction equated to physical presence 
  * Post-International Shoe, the idea of general jurisdiction based on level of business activity of corporate defendants carried over under a fairness reasoning. Minimal contacts test, though applied differently than general jurisdiction
  * Likewise, a corporation is legally present and thus subject to general jurisdiction in state(s) where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business (this is still the case today).
  * Helicopteros decision seemed to affirm the availability of this type of general jurisdiction ("doing business") - it was simply the case the activities of the particular defendant weren't enough to constitute "doing business".
* "At home"
  * Language introduced into the general jurisdiction equation by SCOTUS in *Goodyear*
  * Initially signaled a curtailing on general jurisdiction, but the extent to which was not clear
    * Sustaining a certain level of commerce might no longer lead to general jurisdiction
  * Daimler provides clarification: D has massive corporate presence in CA yet is not held amenable to suit there under theory of general jurisdiction
    * **General jurisdiction requires a relative inquiry that looks to the defendant corporation’s contacts in the jurisdiction relative to their total contacts**
    * Under general jurisdiction doctrine as understood before, systematic and continuous presence would be met here, but not under standard set forth in Daimler, as it only made up a small fraction of its total global presence
    * Significantly narrows the states where general jurisdiction is available, limits forum shopping, and restricts venue transfers
    * Daimler suggests 20-30-20-30 presence across 4 states would not satisfy the relative analysis in any of the states. It would only be "at-home" in the state of incorporation or HQ
  * Following Daimler, general jurisdiction over corporation can be established by any of the following:
    1. **In the state(s) in which it is incorporated in**
    1. **In its principal place of business (i.e. its nerve center/HQ)**
    1. **If the can be made an extraordinary showing that the corporation is essentially "at home" in the state, relative to its total operations**

### *Helicopteros v. Hall*

Construction project undertaken by Colombian entity in Peru, using some personnel and equipment retained in the state of Texas. Accident occurs on the job site; estates of some deceased worker sought to sue Colombian company in TX on general jurisdiction theory. SCOTUS held there was no personal jurisdiction because level of activity failed to meet the threshold needed for "doing business", as it relates to general jurisdiction. "Mere purchases", even if made at regular intervals, were not enough for general jurisdiction

### Goodyear v. Brown

P parents of children killed in Paris bus accident brought suit in NC over faulty tire. Suit was against foreign subsidiary as well as parent company.
SCOTUS holds general jurisdiction is available where activity essentially renders the defendant "at home"

### *Daimler AG v. Bauman*

P’s bring suit arising out of human rights violations connected to Argentina’s Dirty War that involved Argentine based company. German based parent company is responsible for any liabilities that the Argentine company incurred. Parent company also has US based subsidiary. Suit is brought in CA federal court. Ps argue that (1) US subsidiary is subject to general jurisdiction in CA because of its massive level of contacts there, and (2) whatever contacts US subsidiary has in America are attributable to parent company for purposes of jurisdiction according to an agency theory.Though US subsidiary is not incorporated or HQ’d in CA, it has massive corporate presence there and it comprises its largest market in the US. COURT finds that this isn't sufficient for a finding of general jurisdiction. It asserts need for a "relative inquiry" which looks at contacts/activity in a jurisdiction compared to the totality of its operations. Since CA only made up a small proportion of the parent company's global contacts, court ruled that the activity of the US subsidiary in CA is not enough to establish general jurisdiction over the parent company.
