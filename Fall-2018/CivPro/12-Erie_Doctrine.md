# THE LAW APPLIED IN FEDERAL COURTS AND THE ERIE DOCTRINE

## Origins and the Erie Decision

### Class Notes 11/20

* Question of how Erie Doctrine bears on cases heard in federal court, for the most part (at least in this class), will be focuses on federal diversity cases
* Procedural law (e.g. rules governing litigation, available remedies, etc.) is all embodied in FRCP and other federal statutes, so federal courts, almost without exceptions, will apply this law
* 2nd major question addressed by Erie Doctrine relates to "judicial law-making"
  * It matters whether procedural source is statutory or judge made (e.g. forum non conveniens)
  * It will often be the case that federal court will adopt state law, rather than applying federal procedural doctrine
* Swift
  * Court holds that in federal diversity cases purely confined to application of judicial made common law, as opposed to claims under statute, federal court is not bound to state common law and had freedom to exercise independent determination of the "best law"
    * Distinction between statutory/customary law and interpretation of shared body of principles
    * Reflective of Justice Story's vision to construct a uniform body of commercial law that would bring predictability to commercial disputes in a way that would facilitate emergence of U.S. industry
* Procedure in federal courts, for the most part, had been guided by state law leading up to *Erie*
* 2 monumental events in 1930's radically changes federal courts:
  1. 1934 rules enabling act enables SCOTUS to promulgate uniform procedural rules, which culminates in the drafting and adoption of the FRCP
  2. Swift is overturned in Erie decision, as SCOTUS rules "laws of the several states" as articulated in xxxx extends to common law rules. State common law is more than interpretation of shared principles, but distinct substantive state law
* Court in Erie suggesting view of what law is has evolved (philosophically), trending towards legal positivist approach.
