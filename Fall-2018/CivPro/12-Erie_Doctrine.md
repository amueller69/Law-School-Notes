# The Law Applied in Federal Courts and the Erie Doctrine

## Overview of Erie Doctrine

* Fundamental question - which law applies when a federal court is sitting in diversity, federal or state?
  * The scope of this section is limited to federal diversity cases
  * When is state law going to control, not just the substantive law, but also the procedural law in a federal court?
  * *Erie*'s ultimate response can effectively be reduced to the following:
    * Substantive rules of decision (regulatory policy, tort low, contract law, etc.) governed by state law, and procedural law governed by federal law with narrow exceptions
* Two questions requiring focused analysis in Erie Doctrine
  1. First question - What do the federal rules and statutes actually address? What do and don't they govern?
  1. Second question addressed by Erie Doctrine relates to "judicial law-making"
     * It matters whether procedural source is statutory or judge made (e.g. forum non conveniens)
     * It will often be the case that federal court will adopt state law, rather than applying federal procedural doctrine
     * Procedural law (e.g. rules governing litigation, available remedies, etc.) is all embodied in FRCP and other federal statutes, so federal courts, almost without exceptions, will apply this law
* Two legal texts provide starting point for identifying the law that should be applied in federal courts:
  1. Constitution
     * 10th Amendment - “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
     * Article III - Delineates the powers specifically assigned to the federal courts
       * The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish
       * Judicial power includes the authority to resolve certain kinds of cases and controversies including those arising under federal law and cases between citizens of different states
  1. Rules of Decision Act (Judiciary Act of 1789)
     * The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply
     * Concerns about circularity?

## Pre-Erie

* Swift Decision
  * Court holds that in federal diversity cases purely confined to application of judicial made common law, as opposed to claims under statute, federal court is not bound to state common law and had freedom to exercise independent determination of the "best law"
    * Justice Story - Judicial decisions are not laws themselves, but evidence of what the laws are. This reflects his vision of law:
      * His interpretation of the "law of several states" from the Rules Decision Act was of a body of shared principles from which the states draw on, not the individual law of each state
      * When state courts issue common law decisions, they do not "make" law, rather they issue their interpretation of the "existing" common law
    * Justice Story's envisioned a uniform body of commercial law that would bring predictability to commercial disputes in a way that would promote economic efficiency and facilitate the growth of U.S. industry
* Leading up to *Erie*, federal courts sitting on diversity were relying on general federal common law as opposed to that of the individual states
* At the same time, however, procedure in federal courts had been mostly guided by state law
  * 1792 Process Act and 1872 Conformity Act both say that questions of practice and procedure in federal courts are governed by the procedures that would apply in state procedure in state court
* Problems with Swift
  * Created incentives for forum shopping
    * “Discrimination by non-citizens against citizens” because P can choose the court and could use diversity jurisdiction as a way to get a more favorable outcome

## Erie Decision

* 2 monumental events in 1930's radically changes federal courts:
  1. 1934 rules enabling act enables SCOTUS to promulgate uniform procedural rules, which culminates in the drafting and adoption of the FRCP
     * Shift from reliance on state procedures
  2. Swift is overturned in Erie decision, as SCOTUS rules "laws of the several states" as articulated in the Rules Decision Act extends to common law rules
     * State common law is more than interpretation of shared principles, but distinct substantive state law
     * Anytime you are presented with the question about the content of a cause of action in a diversity case (what you might label a “substantive” law question about regulatory or liability issues), use state law
* What does the decision in *Erie* mean?
  * Suggests view of what law is has evolved (philosophically)
    * Trending towards legal positivist approach - There needs to be legitimate and identifiable sovereign authority in order for law to be binding
  * Suggests that for the last 130 years, federal courts may have been articulating a law that congress itself would have no authority to enact due to constitutional constraints
    * This is an issue of federalism - Congress, under powers enumerated in the constitution, could not enact a uniform tort law or contract law if it wanted to. That is effectively what the federal judiciary was doing pre-*Erie*
  * Puts to rest the idea of a general federal common law. Federal courts are not purpose common law courts (though state courts are)
    * Decision stands for the proposition that state courts are the expositors of the contents of state law
  * Can be viewed as an attempt to correct the issues and perverse incentives created by *Swift*
    * All but eliminates forum shopping opportunities if the same law is being applied regardless of whether case is heard in a federal or state court
      * Not clear whether *Erie* created greater parity in the long run. **It may have actually increased forum shopping opportunities**
      * Pre-*Erie*, there was great deal of uniformity in choice of law doctrine among states, meaning Ps had little incentive when selecting forums since same state law would likely apply anyways
      * Uniformity eroded following *Erie*, though the extent of this is not made clear in the notes, nor is *Erie*'s role in the undoing
      * At a time where *Intl Shoe* expanded the states where a D could be held amenable to suit, this gave P more forum shopping opportunities
    * Unequal protection problem: diverse or non-diverse parties in a similar lawsuit could lead to different results
      * Seems unfair to defendant that they will win or lose depending on which court they get sued in
      * However, casebook notes indicates the displacement of state law didn't really give disproportionate power to either party. The only situation where P completely controls where case is heard is when P brings suit in the state in which D is a resident. This prevents removal, effectively permitting P to vertically forum shop (i.e. select the more desirable of state and federal law). Erie undoubtedly helped D in these situations
    * Also an element of uncertainty created by *Swift* which affected how parties in a state regulated their conduct
      * If there were different standards for liability between state and federal court, then how should actors in a state conduct itself to avoid liability? Applicable law is impossible without prior knowledge of opposing party citizenship
* Challenges with *Erie*
  * The tricky part is understanding how this principle works in cases involving judge-made “procedural” law. In light of the Rules of Decision Act (laws of several states shall govern in federal court), and background constitutional context of federal courts as courts of limited jurisdiction, how does this set of principles work when it comes to procedural questions?
    * Courts forced to figure out how to deal with "hazy" distinction between substantive and procedural law, as well as what to do when state and federal procedural law conflict
  * Erie discussed federalism issues and issues about equal protection, both constitutional issues. Post-*Erie* court struggled in subsequent decades to figure out how much of *Erie* decision was a constitutional doctrine vs a matter of policy within federal courts related to procedural questions
    * If the Federal/State procedural distinction is indeed a matter of constitutional law, then it doesn't matter whether the source of the federal law is judicially made or a statute because it can't violate the constitution

### *Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins*

P was injured while walking alongside the train tracks of D. Trespassing is contributory negligence in state of PA, though P argues it should be tried as a matter of general la in federal courts. **Court rules that except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.**. Diversity federal cases cannot create common law at the expense of state sovereignty. Federal system has enumerated powers, with all other powers reserved to the states. Thus, *Swift* approach is unconstitutional.

## Post-Erie

* Some additional consideration regarding the nature of the federal judiciary
  * If source of procedural law is some legislative body (e.g. congress), then it is the obligation of federal courts to administer these policies unless there are constitutional conflicts
  * Federal court has authority to create own procedural law by virtue of being its own independent court system
    * TBW - "It is just part of being a functioning court system"
  * Rules Enabling Act
    * Delegates authority to SCOTUS to promulgate rules related to procedure, evidence, etc. Ultimately culminates with the adoption of the FRCP
    * Prior to clarification in *Hanna*, was unclear the extent to which FRCP could override state procedural law
* Outcome Determination and *Guaranty Trust*
  * Immaterial whether question is characterized as substantive or procedural. Putting this terminology aside, what is relevant to this problem is whether the question would would lead to a substantially different result when federal law is applied
  * Its concern is with federal jurisdictional policy (diversity) approved by congress
    * Congresses intent with diversity statute was not to provide litigants with separate body of law
    * "The operation of a double system of conflicting laws in the same State is plainly hostile to the reign of law"
    * Forum shopping incentives that would be created is relevant here
      * Whether federal policy might create perverse incentives for litigants should factor in as considerations
  * To avoid incompatibility with this policy, state doctrine should prevail where there would be substantially different results
* State v. Federal Interests - *Byrd*
  * Acknowledge post-*Erie* policy of conforming to state rules where there is a divergence in outcomes between federal and state procedures
  * However, it asserts there are countervailing affirmative considerations that may disrupt essential characteristics or functions of the federal court system
    * These may counterbalance or supersede other factors that may create incentives to forum shop and which led court to apply state rules in *Guaranty Trust*
* *Hanna* clarifies the potential constitutional questions created by *Erie*
  * Answer: these situations don’t typically present constitutional problems. When it comes to procedural questions, what’s at stake is fundamentally a matter of statutory or rule-based policy
    * If procedural question is governed by a statute, that means authoritative body has spoken on issue and thus it should be followed
      * There has been an authoritative legislative pronouncement, thus it is fine if there is deviation from state law because legislative body intended to do so
      * No need to balance/resolve competing considerations - legislative body has (presumably) already done so. If federal lawmakers want to create forum shopping incentives, they are free to do so
    * However, where authority is judicially constructed procedural law, these policies must be balanced out against competing priorities
      * *Hanna* describes these priorities as the "twin aims" of *Erie*
      * Twin Aims of *Erie*
        1. Eliminating improper forum shopping incentives - those not related to convenience or protection from bias, but to obtain a more favorable outcome
        1. Preventing inequitable administration of laws - encompasses, among other things, the first aim
      * Twin aims must be present prior to filing where litigants are selecting forum based on modified outcome-determinative test

### Two-Track Analysis

* **Fundamental Question**: What law should apply in federal diversity court?
  * Substantive law is state law, with exceptions in matters governed by congress or the constitution (*Erie*)
  * Judicially-made federal procedure must be measured against statutory command of diversity (Track 1)
  * Federal procedure, if source is statute or FRCP, controls (Track 2)
* **Track 1: Pure Erie**
  * If rule is federal judge-made procedural law, not a rule or statute, conflicting with state law
    * What is the divergence/policy behind state procedural law?
    * Twin aims of Erie: Does federal rule encourage forum shopping or lead to inequitable administration of laws?
    * Affirmative countervailing considerations
* **Track 2: REA**
  * If federal rule is a statute or FRCP, federal procedural law applies to the question
  * Does rule/statute apply to this issue?
    * Is it broad enough to cover the issue at hand?
    * Does it occupy the field against the state statute? (Direct collision)
  * Does allowing it apply fall within grants of authority in REA and the Constitution?
    * 2702(a): must be rules of practice, procedure and evidence
    * 2702(b): cannot abridge, modify, or enlarge any substantive rights

### *Guaranty Trust v. York*

Deals with the doctrine of laches, which is judge-made law. This would allow P to get around SoL in federal court. SCOTUS reaffirms part of *Erie* doctrine in acknowledging that federal court system is not precluded from applying own judicially created procedural rules. However, question court asks is **whether such application would lead to a significantly different outcome than would applying state procedural law**. Congress created diversity jurisdiction in order to give diverse litigants access to federal courts to get over regional or state bias, not to provide them with another body of law. Thus, **should apply state law where such policy conflicts exist**.

### *Byrd v. Blue Ridge*

P sued D in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for injury sustained working as contractor. D contends that P categorized as "statutory employee" which would bar P's claim under state workman's comp law. Case was remanded and major issue is whether factual determination should be made by jury or judge. Here, majority rules that **state rule cannot disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between judge and jury, an essential characteristic of the federal courts and which is rooted in the 7th Amendment** (which is N/A to state courts). **Where state law would interfere with essential characteristic of federal court, concerns about overstepping may be outweighed by interest in applying federal law**. Thus, court holds that state rule should not be followed
