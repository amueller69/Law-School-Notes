# The Law Applied in Federal Courts and the Erie Doctrine

## Overview of Erie Doctrine

* Fundamental question - which law applies when a federal court is sitting in diversity, federal or state?
  * The scope of this section is limited to federal diversity cases
  * When is state law going to control, not just the substantive law, but also the procedural law in a federal court?
  * *Erie*'s ultimate response can effectively be reduced to the following:
    * Substantive rules of decision (regulatory policy, tort low, contract law, etc.) governed by state law, and procedural law governed by federal law with narrow exceptions
* Two questions requiring focused analysis in Erie Doctrine
  1. First question - What do the federal rules and statutes actually address? What do and don't they govern?
  1. Second question addressed by Erie Doctrine relates to "judicial law-making"
     * It matters whether procedural source is statutory or judge made (e.g. forum non conveniens)
     * It will often be the case that federal court will adopt state law, rather than applying federal procedural doctrine
     * Procedural law (e.g. rules governing litigation, available remedies, etc.) is all embodied in FRCP and other federal statutes, so federal courts, almost without exceptions, will apply this law
* Two legal texts provide starting point for identifying the law that should be applied in federal courts:
  1. Constitution
     * 10th Amendment - “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
     * Article III - Delineates the powers specifically assigned to the federal courts
       * The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish
       * Judicial power includes the authority to resolve certain kinds of cases and controversies including those arising under federal law and cases between citizens of different states
  1. Rules of Decision Act (Judiciary Act of 1789)
     * The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply
     * Concerns about circularity?

## Pre-Erie

* Swift Decision
  * Court holds that in federal diversity cases purely confined to application of judicial made common law, as opposed to claims under statute, federal court is not bound to state common law and had freedom to exercise independent determination of the "best law"
    * Justice Story - Judicial decisions are not laws themselves, but evidence of what the laws are. This reflects his vision of law:
      * His interpretation of the "law of several states" from the Rules Decision Act was of a body of shared principles from which the states draw on, not the individual law of each state
      * When state courts issue common law decisions, they do not "make" law, rather they issue their interpretation of the "existing" common law
    * Justice Story's envisioned a uniform body of commercial law that would bring predictability to commercial disputes in a way that would promote economic efficiency and facilitate the growth of U.S. industry
* Leading up to *Erie*, federal courts sitting on diversity were relying on general federal common law as opposed to that of the individual states
* At the same time, however, procedure in federal courts had been mostly guided by state law
  * 1792 Process Act and 1872 Conformity Act both say that questions of practice and procedure in federal courts are governed by the procedures that would apply in state procedure in state court
* Problems with Swift
  * Created incentives for forum shopping
    * “Discrimination by non-citizens against citizens” because P can choose the court and could use diversity jurisdiction as a way to get a more favorable outcome

## Erie Decision

* 2 monumental events in 1930's radically changes federal courts:
  1. 1934 rules enabling act enables SCOTUS to promulgate uniform procedural rules, which culminates in the drafting and adoption of the FRCP
     * Shift from reliance on state procedures
  2. Swift is overturned in Erie decision, as SCOTUS rules "laws of the several states" as articulated in the Rules Decision Act extends to common law rules. State common law is more than interpretation of shared principles, but distinct substantive state law
* What does the decision in *Erie* mean?
  * Suggests view of what law is has evolved (philosophically)
    * Trending towards legal positivist approach - There needs to be legitimate and identifiable sovereign authority in order for law to be binding
  * Suggests that for the last 130 years, federal courts may have been articulating a law that congress itself would have no authority to enact due to constitutional constraints
    * This is an issue of federalism - Congress, under powers enumerated in the constitution, could not enact a uniform tort law or contract law if it wanted to. That is effectively what the federal judiciary was doing pre-*Erie*
  * Puts to rest the idea of a general federal common law. Federal courts are not purpose common law courts (though state courts are)
    * Decision stands for the proposition that state courts are the expositors of the contents of state law
  * Can be viewed as an attempt to correct the issues and perverse incentives created by *Swift*
    * All but eliminates forum shopping opportunities if the same law is being applied regardless if case is heard in a federal or state court
    * Unequal protection problem: diverse or non-diverse parties in a similar lawsuit could lead to different results
