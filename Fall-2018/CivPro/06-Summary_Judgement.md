# Summary Judgement

## Rule 56 Summary Judgement

* Pretrial device to test the factual and/or legal sufficiency of a pleading at the close of discovery
  * Motion for full or partial summary judgment within 30 days of the close of discovery
  * Court typically looks at facts in a light favorable to non-moving party
* Purpose of summary judgement is to infer, from the record, whether a party could conduct a competent trial that a reasonable jury could find compelling.
  * Non-moving party must demonstrate that it can do so, even if evidence is not in an admissable form
* Either P or D (or both) may move for summary judgement
  * Burden of production: What moving party must come forward with for their motion to be considered
  * Burden of persuasion: What moving party must persuade court that there is no genuine issue of material fact from their position
  * Typically, P carries the burden of producing evidence on every contested element of its complaint
  * Defensive motions are those filed by D. D must show that P's evidence failed to establish genuine issue. The burden of production then shifts to P, who must point evidence in record showing disputes in fact. Burden of persuasion still remains with D.
  * Defensive motions for summary judgement are far more prevalent and make up majority of case law, but offensive motions can and do occur. In these cases, burden is significantly higher. P must demonstrate that **all** of the pertinent evidence points in only one direction, conclusively demonstrating the truth of its allegations.
* Rule 56(c): Granting SJ is proper if record shows there are no genuine issues as to any material fact (i.e. no reason to subject it to trier of fact) and the moving party is entitled to judgement as a mater of law.
  1. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
     * (A) Citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
     * (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
  2. A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.
* Rule 56(d): If respondent believes discovery period has been inadequate when summary judgement is motioned for, allows respondent to move for additional time at court's discretion
* Rule 56(f): Courts can make judgments independent of a motion or the party filing the motion
* Court Interpretation of Rule 56
  * *Celotex* is concerned with the burden of the moving party in showing the absence of issues of material fact. Moving party must go beyond simply asserting "You've got nothing" or putting opposing party to its proof, but need not show by preponderance of the evidence that opposing parties claims are false
    * Example: if defendant propounded an interrogatory that said, “Identify every document you claim demonstrates, or tends to demonstrate, that Mr. Catrett was exposed to defendant’s asbestos,” and the answer to that interrogatory is, “Plaintiff is aware of no such documents,” then that interrogatory answer is a part of the discovery record that demonstrates an absence of material in support of plaintiff’s claim.
      * Affidavits showing absence not necessary so long as standard of entry of summary judgement is satisfied.
      * "One of the principal purposes of the summary judgement rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defense...it should be interpreted in a way that allows it to accomplish this purpose"
  * In minority view, pointing out part of the record that demonstrates absence of factual basis for plaintiff's claim shifts burden on resisting party to show otherwise
* No genuine dispute of material fact
  * Standard depends on judge's conclusion that no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party based on the evidence of record
  * Deferential Standard is to draw inferences most favorable to plaintiff
    * Neglected in *Harris* because Justice Scalia claims video resolves any dispute of facts - weakening of the standard
      * Begging the question: summary judgement is a device used to determine whether there are disputes of material fact, but Scalia proposes court only make inferences favorable to non-moving party where facts are genuinely disputable. Absence of genuine dispute of material fact is already assumed prior to the analysis.
  * *Harris* court takes away the decision from the jury, even when there seem to be clear issues of triable fact (video is interpreted differently throughout multiple courts)

### *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*

D files motion for summary judgement on grounds that there is no evidence in support of wrongful death claim. District court grants motion, reasoning that there was no showing D's product was linked to wrongful death. Court of Appeals holds that the summary judgement was defective because the motioning party made no effort and thus failed to produce evidence showing the absence of any issues of fact, citing FRCP Rule 56(e). Supreme court rejects CoA's interpretation of Rule 56. It affirms rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgement after adequate amount of time for discovery if a party fails to sufficiently show an element essential to their claim. It also agrees **that party seeking judgement bears initial responsibility for informing the court of the basis of its motion and identifying items in the record, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue. However, the court found no requirement, express or implied in Rule 56, for a party to make an affirmative evidentiary showing that would negate its opponent's claims**. Instead, the portion of Rule 56(e) that is at issue was intended to prevent resistance of summary judgement by opposing parties who simply reference the pleadings and conclusory assertions. The courts decision clarifies *Adickes*: Rule 56 should not be construed to mean the burden is on the moving party to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Instead, burden on moving party is satisfied by "showing" (i.e. pointing out) that there is an absence of evidence to support the opposing party's case.

## Scott v. Harris

P is paralyzed after he is involved in a car crash while attempting to flee police. The officer pursuing P caused the accident while attempting to immobilize the vehicle. Video evidence is presented and D moves for summary judgement based on qualified immunity. TC denies motion for summary judgement, finding there are issues of material fact. CoA affirms District Court. Supreme Court grants certiorari. Court rules that **when the facts present by the non-moving party so blatantly contradict a parties claims, the court does not need to hold them in a light favorable to him/her when considering a summary judgment motion**. In light of video evidence, Scott’s attempts to terminate dangerous high-speed car case that threatened innocent lives did not violate the 4th Amendment, even if the motorist was a risk of serious injury or death. The consequence of this decision is that the court takes away the decision from the jury, even when there seem to be clear issues of triable fact on which a jury may draw on a separate body of knowledge and reasoning when weighing evidence
