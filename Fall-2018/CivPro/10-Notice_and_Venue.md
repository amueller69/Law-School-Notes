## Notice and Service Process

* What is the Constitution trying to protect through Due Process?
  * Accuracy/reliability in application of the law
    * Competing priorities
      * More procedure = more accuracy
      * More procedure = expensive and a barrier to litigation
  * Fairness through an unbiased tribunal through a rule of law
    * "Nation of Laws" and resolution of disputes should be determined by neutral laws
  * Opportunities for voice, protection of the dignity of the individual
* Service of Process - the formal mechanism by which the court attaches its power to the person of the defendant
  * Service of process also performs a notification function by telling the defendant that a lawsuit has been filed against him
  * Due Process concerns - Before a court deprives you of your property, it needs to demonstrate that it has taken adequate steps to inform you of the action and give you an opportunity to participate and make arguments
  * Service of process refers to delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant
  * Summons - a document that has to be signed and executed by seal by clerk of the court. When plaintiff brings lawsuit, she files the complaint with the court and fills out a summons form that gets signed by the clerk.
* Rule 4
  * Is the roadmap for how service of process operates
  * It provides a series of federal procedures for how service of process and notification operate, as well as references to state law
    * Rule 4 explicitly says that federal courts can look to state law in some circumstances to figure out what to do

### Mechanics of Service of Process Under Rule 4

* Who can serve?
  * Any person who as at 18 years or older and is not a party to the suit
  * At P's request, court may order service be made by a U.S. Marshall, deputy, or some other person specially appointed by the court
* How to serve domestic (non-artificial) persons? 2 Categories of approach:
    1. 4(e)(1) - Making use of state process provisions
    1. 4(e)(2) - Federal methods available in all cases
      * In hand delivery to respondent
      * Physical delivery to place of dwelling so long as is left with person of suitable age and discretion
      * Delivery by mail is notably not present in federal provisions. Federal courts view it as less than ideal for confident/reliable delivery
        * Most states typically have a physical mail delivery provision that can be made use of under 4(e)(2)
* How to serve corporations and other artificial entities?
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Make use of state provisions
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Delivery to an agent, authorized either expressly or constructively by the entity, to receive service of process
    * Can't just hand to whomever is at the front desk
* Waiver of Service (Rule 4(d))
  * Instead of using a formal 4(e) method, you can use the waiver process
    * Mail defendant a copy of the complaint and the summons and attach a waiver for the defendant to sign and mail back to the plaintiff
    * Receipt of waiver by court is a substitute to formal service of process
  * What is respondent's incentive to waive?
    * If agree to waiver, then you get more time to respond to the complaint--60 days from when waiver was sent, as opposed to 21 days from an in-person summons
    * Unless respondent has good cause not to waive, will bear cost of declining the waiver (i.e. the expenses claimant incurs in formally serving)
  * Is applicable to both artificial and non-artificial entities
* Time limits for service of process
  * Service must be effectuated within 90 days from filing the complaint, though it can be extended for good cause (e.g. defendant avoiding process)
    * Failure to serve in time can result in the claim being dismissed
      * At best you have to do it again
      * At worst, statute of limitations bars bringing the claim again
        * Relevant statute of limitations (fed/state?) is important
        * Waiver of service => if you go this route, you better know your statute of limitations and make sure it's satisfied
* Serving minors or people with mental impairments
  * 4(g) - state law controls
    * Rationale - serious policy questions here, and states are primarily entrusted with safeguarding the interests of their citizens

* Constitutional standards of notice:
  * *Mullane* addresses question of what procedures for notice are constitutionally required when some parties to a lawsuit are known and identified individuals but others are unknown or could only be identified through enormous effort
    * Answer:
