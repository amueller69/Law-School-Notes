# Notice, Venue Rules, and Forum Non Conveniens

## Notice and Service Process

* What is the Constitution trying to protect through Due Process?
  * Accuracy/reliability in application of the law
    * Entitled to a process designed to reach the correct outcome
    * Competing priorities
      * More procedure = more accuracy
      * More procedure = expensive and a barrier to litigation
  * Fairness through an unbiased tribunal through a rule of law
    * "Nation of Laws" and resolution of disputes should be determined by neutral laws
  * Opportunities for voice, protection of the dignity of the individual
    * "The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard". *Grannis v. Ordean*
    * Right to participate in the adjudication. This participation both increases the likelihood of an accurate result but also promotes the litigants' acceptance of adjudication
    * This is a major function of notice - it has little reality or worth unless one in informed that matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default
  * However, as stated above, there are competing considerations - the interests of state and justice system
    * It wants to advance important policies and priorities without being subject to excessively expensive or burdensome demands of highly robust process
    * **Thus, the primary inquiry in due process analysis asks the level of process required constitutionally to guarantee sufficient accuracy, sufficient reliability, sufficiently individualized determination with respect to each litigant, without unduly burdening or compromising interest of state to administer a civil justice system**
* Service of Process - the formal mechanism by which the court attaches its power to the person of the defendant
  * Service of process also performs a notification function by telling the defendant that a lawsuit has been filed against him
  * Due Process concerns - Before a court deprives you of your property, it needs to demonstrate that it has taken adequate steps to inform you of the action and give you an opportunity to participate and make arguments
  * Service of process refers to delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant
  * Summons - a document that has to be signed and executed by seal by clerk of the court. When plaintiff brings lawsuit, she files the complaint with the court and fills out a summons form that gets signed by the clerk.
* Rule 4
  * Is the roadmap for how service of process operates
  * It provides a series of federal procedures for how service of process and notification operate, as well as references to state law
    * Rule 4 explicitly says that federal courts can look to state law in some circumstances to figure out what to do

### Mechanics of Service of Process Under Rule 4

* Who can serve?
  * Any person who as at 18 years or older and is not a party to the suit
  * At P's request, court may order service be made by a U.S. Marshall, deputy, or some other person specially appointed by the court
* How to serve domestic (non-artificial) persons? 2 Categories of approach:
    1. 4(e)(1) - Making use of state process provisions
    1. 4(e)(2) - Federal methods available in all cases
      * In hand delivery to respondent
      * Physical delivery to place of dwelling so long as is left with person of suitable age and discretion
      * Delivery by mail is notably not present in federal provisions. Federal courts view it as less than ideal for confident/reliable delivery
        * Most states typically have a physical mail delivery provision that can be made use of under 4(e)(2)
* How to serve corporations and other artificial entities?
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Make use of state provisions
  * 4(h)(1)(a) - Delivery to an agent, authorized either expressly or constructively by the entity, to receive service of process
    * Can't just hand to whomever is at the front desk
* Waiver of Service (Rule 4(d))
  * Instead of using a formal 4(e) method, you can use the waiver process
    * Mail defendant a copy of the complaint and the summons and attach a waiver for the defendant to sign and mail back to the plaintiff
    * Receipt of waiver by court is a substitute to formal service of process
  * What is respondent's incentive to waive?
    * If agree to waiver, then you get more time to respond to the complaint--60 days from when waiver was sent, as opposed to 21 days from an in-person summons
    * Unless respondent has good cause not to waive, will bear cost of declining the waiver (i.e. the expenses claimant incurs in formally serving)
  * Is applicable to both artificial and non-artificial entities
* Time limits for service of process
  * Service must be effectuated within 90 days from filing the complaint, though it can be extended for good cause (e.g. defendant avoiding process)
    * Failure to serve in time can result in the claim being dismissed
      * At best you have to do it again
      * At worst, statute of limitations bars bringing the claim again
        * Relevant statute of limitations (fed/state?) is important
        * Waiver of service => if you go this route, you better know your statute of limitations and make sure it's satisfied
* Serving minors or people with mental impairments
  * 4(g) - state law controls
    * Rationale - serious policy questions here, and states are primarily entrusted with safeguarding the interests of their citizens

* Constitutional standards of notice:
  * Is it a good requirement for court to say that defendant needs to receive \*actual notice\* for due process to be satisfied?
    * Obvious benefit - it guarantees that defendant is actually aware that interests might be compromised
    * Bears on the "opportunity to be heard" component of due process
    * Problem is one of allocation responsibility: How much responsibility must plaintiff take to bring matter to defendant's attention and how much responsibility must defendant exercise to effectively receive the notice?
* *Mullane* addresses question of what procedures for notice are constitutionally required when some parties to a lawsuit are known and identified individuals but others are unknown or could only be identified through enormous effort
  * Answer: Must be a reasonably calculated attempt to inform, the means of which might be employed by someone who is actually seeking to accomplish such notice
    * Reasonably certain to inform those affected or, at the very least, not significantly less likely to bring home notice than other feasible substitutes
  * "Personal service" is not indispensible in all circumstances"
    * People move around, plaintiff might not have defendant’s address, impractical based on number of individuals, it would be very expensive, etc.
    * Might also incentivize strategic avoidance of service and thus litigation cannot occur
* *Mullane* standard applied elsewhere
  * *Greene v. Lindsey* - Eviction notices being posted on doors where public housing authorities knew notices were being ripped off by children. Court held that, based on factual record, this failed to satisfy constitutional requirements
  * *Jones v. Flowers* - Notice sent by certified mail (traditionally viewed as the gold standard for providing notice). Certified mail by nature comes with receipt of successful delivery. Taxing authorities got informed that mail delivery was not successful. They then did nothing. Court found that in this circumstance, certified mail was constitutionally insufficient notice

### *Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.*

Issue in controversy is constitutional sufficiency of notice to beneficiaries on judicial settlement of accounts by trustee of common trust fund. D establishes common trust fund comprised of 113 individual trusts, which effectively pooled the assets of which beneficiaries ratable share. Only notice given to beneficiaries was by publication of local newspaper in compliance with minimum requirements of NY state law. P contends that notice of interests being participant to this investment vehicle (common fund) was insufficient. Due process clause requires (at a minimum) that deprivation of life, liberty, or property by way of adjudication must be proceeded by notice and opportunity for hearing. Court rules the proceeding to establish common fund may deprive beneficiaries in two ways: it may cut off their rights to have trustee answer for impairment of their interests and their interests are subject to diminution by fees/expenses without their knowledge. Court thus asserts **notice must be of such nature to reasonably convey required information and afford a reasonable tim for those interested to make an appearance. However, notice which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it. Reasonableness/constitutional sufficiency can be defended on grounds that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected or, where conditions do not permit such notice, that form chosen isn't less likely to provide notice that substitutes**

## Venue

* Venue, in general
  * Relates to statutory requirement in §1391 that identifies which judicial district you can bring your lawsuit in
  * A separate and distinct requirement and analysis from personal jurisdiction. It is another hoop to jump through in initiating lawsuit
    * Jurisdiction is concerned with "power to adjudicate", while Venue is often distinguished as being concerned with the "convenience of trial"
  * A matter of administrative convenience for the federal courts which district you would bring lawsuit in
    * Also concerned with  the efficient functioning of the federal system
  * It is usually the case if you are able to obtain PJ, you can have venue in the same district court
  * Federal venue operates both *intra-jurisdictionally*, to allocate a case within a multi-district state, as well as *inter-jurisdictionally*, to allocate as case within the nationwide federal judicial system.
* There are two primary mechanisms to satisfy venue according to §1391
  * 1391(b)(1) – Residency Venue
    * Venue is any district the D resides if all D’s reside in the same state
    * Venue amendments provide that a natural person is "deemed to reside" in the judicial district in which that person is domiciled
    * For a corporation or unincorporated entity - anywhere they are subject to personal jurisdiction
    * In multi-district states, a defendant corporation is deemed subject to personal jurisdiction in a district if its contacts with the district would be sufficient to subject it to jurisdiction if the district were a separate state
    * When corporation is plaintiff, then residence is limited to district where it makes its principal place of business
    * In multi-defendant cases, venue is proper in district where \*any\* D resides, if \*all\* Ds reside in the same state
      * In multi-D case where Ds from different states, brining suit in district that is residence of only one of the D's is not proper venue
  * 1391(b)(2) - Substantial Part
    * Venue established where substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim ocurred
    * This is the most relevant venue provision for cases involving multiple Ds from different states
  * 1391(b)(3) – Venue of Last Resort
    * If there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought, venue will be proper in any district in which any D is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action
    * Catch-all – if and only if venue is not established in (b)(1) or (b)(2), venue can be anywhere any D is subject to personal jurisdiction
    * This rarely comes up
* Venue Transfer
  * Option to transfer cases between districts in the federal system, but N/A in state courts
  * §1404 allows transfer of a case from district it was filed to any other district where it could have been brought
    * Exception: if every party involved consents to the transfer
  * If you can show that venue you seek to transfer to do would have been originally available, court has discretion to, in the interest of justice and convenience to parties, to allow the transfer
* §1406 is a tool available for the district court
  * Where plaintiff has filed lawsuit in district where there is no venue, the district court can dismiss the case for lack of venue, or in the interest of justice transfer the suit to another district where it could have been brought
  * This can save plaintiffs new filing fees or the risk of running past the statute of limitations and not being able to file again
  * Choice of law rules travel with the case as it travels across the country (VanDeusen case)
  * Can also happen if no PJ in first district
    * Choice of law, obviously, does not follow here (if it wasn’t proper in the first place…)
* §1407 Multi-district litigation (MDL)
  * Statute that allows the federal courts, via a special panel of judges appointed by the Chief Justice, to take cases from around the country that share common issues of law and fact-related cases, and transfers all of them to be a single district to be administered by one judge for pre-trial purposes
  * Consolidation mechanism that is hallmark of modern complex litigation. Powerful tool that takes similarly related cases from around country and have them heard by single judge

## Forum Non Conveniens

* Forum Non Conveniens, in general
  * A purely judge-made doctrine in the federal courts, an example of federal common law
  * An additional doctrine of discretion that may further restrict a plaintiff's ultimate selection of a forum and provides a defendant with some counter-control over where suit may be brought
  * Judicial discretion to dismiss action otherwise appropriate for lack of convenience in light of an alternative venue, despite the fact that proper jurisdiction and venue requirements were met in the first forum
  * Weight should be given to P’s choice of forum if based on convenience
    * However, where choice appears to be purely strategic, less defence is given to P's choice
  * Factors considered by court in exercising discretion
    * Extent to which lawsuits has major non-US components (proposed alternative venue would not be one eligible for transfer because it is in foreign country)
    * Private factors: convenience, cost, witness availability, enforceability of judgment
    * Public factors: unclear whether nature of claim and law should matter, using juries to interpret challenging law
  * The district court can balance above factors in deciding whether to dismiss the lawsuit
    * The mere fact that dismissal will be bad for plaintiff is not a reason to hesitate to dismiss
    * However, not merely about slight relative differences in convenience. Factors must point significantly in direction of external forum
* D can waive defects to induce P to bring suit in foreign court (e.g. pay expenses, waive SoL) Why would a defendant want a lawsuit outside the US?
  * Less availability of contingency-fee lawyers in other countries if it's even allowed
  * US discovery rules are much more generous and invasive than other countries, even with the newer proportionality standard
  * US juries more generous than in other countries (and other countries don't necessarily have juries for civil cases)
  * US/state law would apply more likely than not, and tort doctrine in the US has more likelihood of recovery for plaintiff
  * Sometimes defendants will make concessions to bring cases in forum that is foreign…very few cases are brought/re-filed
* When the burden falls on parties AND the courts, the court can take that into account when considering is a US court is excessively inconvenient
  * Is there a public interest in seeing this adjudicated locally?
    * Yes, usually if P is domestic or events occurred domestically
    * Doesn’t have to be 100%, but has to be a strong interest
* Unless there’s no remedy at all, courts are reluctant to dismiss FNC solely because P would be disadvantaged by change of law.

### Piper Aircraft v. Reyno

Plane crash in Scotland, D manufacturer in PA and propeller manufacturer in Ohio. Scottish P brings suit in California because of more favorable law. Court ruled that P may not defeat a motion to dismiss on grounds of FNC merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the present forum. Possibility of unfavorable change in law (from US to Scottish law) should not be a substantial factor in a FNC inquiry.
