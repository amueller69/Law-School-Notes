# Intro to Jurisdiction

## Personal Jurisdiction

* **Personal Jurisdiction**: a set of doctrines about where, geographically, you can bring a lawsuit
* Competing considerations in determining personal jurisdiction
  * Fairness - There needs to be a relationship between a parties activity in a state and its liability to being sued in that forum
  * State Sovereignty - Serving within its own geographic boundaries is a power reserved by the state
* Disadvantages of Unlimited Personal Jurisdiction
  * Economic - Cost of litigating in a court that resides several states away
  * Differences in state law that may be more favorable to the plaintiffs claim
  * A hostile judiciary or one more sympathetic to plaintiff
  * Unfamiliarity with the particular state's court system

* Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  * Rule 4(e)
    * Unless otherwise prohibited, person can be served in a Federal judicial district by:
      1. Following state law for summoning as defined by court in the state where the Federal district is located
      2. Doing any of the following:
         * Personally delivering the summons
         * Delivering it to individual's dwelling in the possession of a competent individual
         * Delivering to an agent authorized by law or appointment to receive service of process
  * Rule 4(k)
    * Serving summons or filing a waiver establishes personal jurisdiction over an individual who:
      * Is subject to jurisdiction in the state where district is located or is served in a different judicial district no more than 100 miles away
      * Is not subject to **any** state court's jurisdiction

### *New York Times v. Sullivan*

New York Times files motion to quash service of process on several grounds, including lack of personal jurisdiction due to improper service. The court rejected this assertion and relied on three theories to establish personal jurisdiction. First, the court holds that the NYT waived its special appearance in its motion to quash because the challenge of subject matter jurisdiction was outside the scope of the stated specific purpose.
> This defendant cannot assert that that it is not properly before this Court, and in the same breath argue that if it is, this Court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action

In doing so, it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Next, the court found the Times' business activities sufficient as to subject it to jurisdiction for any claims existing out of such activities (*specific jurisdiction*) Finally, the Court found that:
> [The] systemic business dealings in Alabama give the Times substantial contact with the State of Alabama , considerably in excess of the minimal contacts required by the Supreme Court decisions....The times does business in Alabama.

This extensive and continuous business activity in Alabama, the court reasons, renders the Times as effectively "present" in the state. This would mean a claim wouldn't need to arise out of specific business dealings Hence, the motion to quash is denied.

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction

* Subject Matter Jurisdiction
  * Authority of a court to adjudicate a particular type of case.
  * Determines federal/state scope of lawsuit
* Diversity of Citizenship
  * A basis for a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction over a case that arises due to parties in the suit residing in separate states
  * Requires complete diversity - the "domicility" of all juridical people on one side of a suit must be different than all parties on the other side.
* Removal refers specifically to moving case filed in state court to federal court
  * Removal is generally available when a case that was filed in state court could also have been filed in federal court as an original matter (also called original jurisdiction)
  * Party may exercise certain tactics when filing the claim so as to prevent defendant from removing to federal court
* Juridical Person: A "person", real or artificial, that is recognized for the purpose of a lawsuit.
  * Some entities, such of partnerships, are made up of several different juridical persons and thus has multiple citizenship for diversity purposes
* Fraudulent Joinder
  * A legal term of art used to describe parties that are included in a claim with which the plaintiff has no real cause of action with and were named for the purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction
  * The intent behind a joinder isn't sufficient to constitute as fraudulent. A joinder made with the intent of defeating diversity jurisdiction will likely be upheld if there is an actual claim against that party. The merit of the claim is what is important
  * A consequence of the fraudulent joinder doctrine is that a judge may "pierce the pleadings" in order to determine whether a party was fraudulently joined. Thus an inquiry into the merits of a claim takes place at a stage in the litigation where allegations are not typically subject to contention. This may create additional burdens for claimants in diversity jurisdiction cases

### *Rose v. Giamatti*

Pete Rose (P) files motion to have case remanded back to Ohio state courts after the MLB commissioner (D) removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiff challenges existence of diversity jurisdiction, citing two other parties named in the suit, the MLB and Cincinnati Reds, as citizens of the state of Ohio. Defendant contends that these parties were "fraudulently joined" to the suit in order to defeat removal jurisdiction.

In its decision, the Court cites the following well established legal doctrine:

* Plaintiff cannot defeat a defendant's right of removal by the "fraudulent joinder" of a non-diverse party against which the plaintiff has no real cause of action.
  * Court can consider both the pleadings and the entire record to make this determination
* Court must disregard nominal/formal parties and consider only the real parties to the controversy when determining diversity jurisdiction.
  * A nominal or formal party is one that has no interest in the result of the suit or no control over the subject matter in the litigation.

  The Court found that, on the basis of the allegations in the complaint, there was no controversy between Rose and the Cincinnati Reds, rendering the Reds as nominal party. Likewise, MLB was also found to be a nominal party. The League itself has no direct control over the commissioners actions, nor any obligation to moderate them. The controversy lies solely between Rose and the commissioner. Since the only real party, the commissioner, is a citizen of a different state, diversity jurisdiction is affirmed and the plaintiff's motion is denied.
