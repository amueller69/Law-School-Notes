Trial court holds that the NYT waived its special appearance in its motion to quash because the challenge of subject matter jurisdiction was  was outside the scope of the stated specific purpose.

> This defendant cannot assert that that it is not properly before this

> jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.

Whether or not the original service of process was valid is now irrelevant, as the Times have made a general appearance. Regardless, the Court found that:
> [The] systemic business dealings in Alabama give the Times substantial 
> contact with the State of Alabama , considerably in excess of the
> minimal contacts required by the Supreme Court decisions....The times
> does business in Alabama.

Finally, the court held that even if the plaintiff's claims were unrelated to the Time's business in Alabama, due process does not require the cause of action arise out of the business being done there.

**Motion to quash denied.**
