## New York Times v. Sullivan
Trial court holds that the NYT waived its special appearance in its motion to quash because the challenge of subject matter jurisdiction was outside the scope of the stated specific purpose.

> This defendant cannot assert that that it is not properly before this
> Court, and in the same breath argue that if it is, this Court has no 
> jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action.

Whether or not the original service of process was valid is now irrelevant, as the Times have made a general appearance. Regardless, the Court found that:
> [The] systemic business dealings in Alabama give the Times substantial 
> contact with the State of Alabama , considerably in excess of the
> minimal contacts required by the Supreme Court decisions....The times
> does business in Alabama.

Finally, the court held that even if the plaintiff's claims were unrelated to the Time's business in Alabama, due process does not require the cause of action arise out of the business being done there.

**Motion to quash denied.**

## Rose v. Giamatti

#### Determination of Diversity Jurisdiction

Pete Rose (P) files motion to have case remanded back to Ohio state courts after the MLB commissioner (D) removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiff challenges existence of diversity jurisdiction, citing two other parties named in the suit, the MLB and Cincinnati Reds, as citizens of the state of Ohio. Defendant contends that these parties were "fradulently joined" to the suit in order to defeat removal jurisdiction.

In its decision, the Court cites the following well established legal doctorine:

* Plaintiff cannot defeat a defendant's right of removal by the "fradulent joinder" of a non-diverse party against which the plaintiff has no real cause of action.
  * Court can consider both the pleadings and the entire record to make this determination.
* Court must disregard nominal/formal parties and consider only the real parties to the controversy when determining diversity jurisdiction.
  * A nominal or formal party is one that has no interest in the result of the suit or no control over the subject matter in the litigation.

  The Court found that, on the basis of the allegations in the complaint, there was no controversy between Rose and the Cincinnati Reds, rendering the Reds as nominal party. Likewise, MLB was also found to be a nominal party. The League itself has no direct control over the commissioners actions, nor any obligation to moderate them. The controversy lies soley between Rose and the commissioner. Since the only real party, the commissioner, is a citizen of a different state, diversity jurisdiction is affirmed and the plaintiff's motion is denied.
