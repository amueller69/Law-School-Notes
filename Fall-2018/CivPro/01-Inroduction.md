# Introduction - What is Civil Procedure

## What is a Lawsuit

* A legal mechanism enabling someone whom believes they have been wronged to recover through court provided remedies.
* A series of burdens on an aggrieved individual in order to show that they are entitled to relief.
* A series of opportunities for a defendant to deny relief to the plaintiff on the grounds that they failed to satisfy these burdens.

## Distinction between Civil and Criminal Law

### Criminal Law

* Object of proceedings is punishment
* Governs rules of conduct imposed by state
* Enforced through state initiated prosecutions
* Governed by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
* State has burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt

### Civil Law

* Object of proceeding is remedy for injury in form of a judgement
* Defines rights and obligations people owe one another
* Enforced through privately initiated actions
* Governed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  * Rules with characteristics of "quasi-legislation" that guide civil actions in Federal courts
  * State procedural systems may vary in significant ways
* Less demanding burden of proof - a fair preponderance of the evidence

## Structure of Courts

### Federal Court System

* Considered to have *limited subject matter authority*
  * Can only hear cases if authorized to do so by federal statute and Article III of Constitution
* Three tiers
  1. Trial courts - Organized by district (*district courts*)
  1. Intermediate courts - Organized by circuit (*courts of appeal*)
  1. Supreme Court - Final appellate authority over:
     1. Cases brought in federal courts
     1. Cases brought in state courts raising questions governed by federal law

### State Court System

* Considered to have *plenary authority*
  * Able to hear cases involving subject matter not exclusively reserved for federal courts
* Structure of the court system varies by state
  * Typically a trial court, and intermediate court of appeals, and a supreme court

## Stages of a Lawsuit

### 1. Investigation

* Aggrieved party consults attorney. Attorney is obliged with determining whether claim has merit.

### 2. Fee Arrangements

* If claim is deemed to have merit, lawyer will make arrangement for payment of fee in exchange for representation.
* *American rule* is the dominant one in this country. Each side pays own attorney fees regardless of case outcome
* In many civil cases, a *contingent fee* is agreed to, in which a percent of recovery will be paid to attorney if successful.

### 3. Subject Matter Jurisdiction

* Determine which court has the authority to hear lawsuits of the type
* State courts are courts of general subject matter with small exceptions
* Federal courts are courts of limited subject matter. There are two bases:
  1. *Arising under* jurisdiction - Cause of action comes from violation of federal law, treaty, or the Constitution
  2. *Diversity* jurisdiction - Meets complete diversity requirement (opposing parties from different states and amount in question is > $75,000)
* For certain types of cases (e.g. securities, antitrust, patent, and trademark), federal courts are said to have exclusive jurisdiction.

### 4. Personal Jurisdiction

* Determining whether a court with authority over a specific geographic region has personal jurisdiction over the defendant

### 5. Service of Process

* Notifying the defendant of the commencement of the lawsuit, typically achieved through a *summons*

### 6. Pleadings

* Inform defendant of the claims at varying levels of detail based on the rules of a jurisdiction.
* The initial *complaint*, which often accompanies the summons, must at the very minimum lay out basic claims that show plaintiff is entitled to relief
* Defendant must respond through one several available actions including *dispositive motions* that will dismiss the case or an *answer* that either affirms the claims made in the complaint. A *counterclaim* can also be asserted.

### 7. Remedies

* Type of relief being sought. Can take the form of money damages or a court order to do or refrain from doing something

### 8. Pretrial Discovery

* Process of obtaining information from opposing party and witnesses. Occurs through a variety of mechanisms

### 9. Summary Judgement

* Either party can motion for a judgement prior to the commencement of the trial based on a lack of factual sufficiency of the opposing party's position

### 10. Trial

* If the case is not dismissed and a summary judgement isn't awarded, it will go to either a jury trial or a bench trial.
* Burden of persuasion -- convincing the judge/jury that a fair preponderance of evidence supports their position -- typically falls on the plaintiff.

### 11. Appeal

* Every legal system in the US provides for review of a trial court decision by an appellate court
* Appellate court decides case on **sole** basis of written record of trial proceedings
* Appellate court has power to affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the judgement

### 12. Enforcement of Judgements

* Judgements involving money damages often require enforcement proceedings to govern execution and assets involved

### 13. Finality

* Characteristic of all dispute-resolution mechanisms that prevents re-litigation of claims that have already been tried
