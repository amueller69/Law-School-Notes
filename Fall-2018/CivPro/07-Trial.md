# Trial

## Civil Jury Trials

* "Right" to jury trial in civil actions derived from 7th Amendment, though only applies at federal level. States not obliged to guarantee civil trial by jury
  * Actions seeking equitable relief don't typically have this right extended to them, unless the underlying facts overlap with that of a claim for compensatory relief
  * Judge and Jury
    * Law-fact allocation: juries only hear what judges deem appropriate evidence
      * Greatest control judge has over jury is the power to prevent case from ever reaching a jury and/or issuing a JNOV
      * Verdicts once rendered make it very difficult to overturn based on a factual determination by the jury
    * Benefits of the jury system
      * Ordinary citizens determine the law
      * Civic participation and community sensibility
  * Detriments of the jury system:
    * Complex subject matter
    * Inconsistencies and unpredictability
* Rule 38 - Demanding a Jury Trial
  * Must request within 14 days
  * Parties usually put requests in pleading docs

## Trial Procedure

* Pre-Trial Order
  * Constructed in pretrial conference following discovery. Rule specifies the order can only be modified to avoid "manifest injustice" The reasoning behind this is to eliminate potential for a "trial-by-surprise"
  * Parties will establish how many days trial will be, what witnesses, expert testimony, and documents the parties want to present, the admissibility of evidence. This happens as close to the day of trial as possible
  * Any evidence offered that is not included in the Final Pretrial Order may be excluded from the trial if the opposing party objects to its introduction
  * Inclusion of witness, evidence, etc. does not obligate parties to present them. Instead, it maps out everything that *can* happen in trial
* Voir Dire
  * People called for jury service show up in the venire of potential jurors, fill out a questionnaire, are asked questions by either the judge or the lawyers in a process called voir dire (“speaking the truth”).
  * Purpose is to determine if the prospective jurors have personal knowledge of facts/circumstances surrounding the case, including any personal relationships with either party, and to see if the juror can be impartial and make decisions based on the evidence presented rather than coming in with a preconceived idea of what party should win
  * Jurors are stricken “for cause” if they have some connection to the case or cannot be impartial. Unlimited number of these challenges
  * Preemptory challenges used to strike jurors without cause. Alloted 3 of them. Important series of cases addressing use of these challenges for purposes that are discriminatory and that constitution deems inappropriate (i.e. on the basis of sex or race)
    * Function is to challenge causes that are difficult to articulate
* Once a jury is seated, the parties begin presentation. P goes first. The goal is to put on a legally sufficient case and also weaving together a compelling narrative to the jury. Trials are about telling stories; the best trial lawyers can keep strategic legal questions in their head while also weaving together a compelling story to the jury.
* **Rule 50(a) - Judgement as a Matter of Law (JAML)**
  * Judgement awarded after party has an opportunity to present evidence, legal theories, and conclusion on grounds they have failed to establish sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find in their favor
  * Should be granted if "a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is not legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue"
  * Primary difference between Rule 56 and Rule 50 -A fight over Rule 56 motion looks at the discovery record. A fight over Rule 50 motion looks at the trial record
  * Reason a JAML may be granted despite surviving summary judgement:
    * Key piece of evidence could not be put into admissible form. Body of evidence court scrutinizes is different from that presented at trial
      * Example: Witness recanting testimony
    * Evidence that was compelling on its face failed to withstand questioning at trial
  * Four Categories of Analytical Questions when Drawing Inferences
    1. What evidence is in front of you?
    2. What kinds of inferences based on evidentiary record about what else maybe going on; what circumstantial evidence?
    3. What kinds of assumptions about how this situation usually works?
    4. Questions about social policy and normative values in relation to requirements of substantive rule?
  * *Dixon*
    * Central issue: where you have a case where there is some evidence, but unavoidable indeterminacy, how much can people rely on instinct and their view about what typically happens in this kind of situation and still say that they are acting as reasonable jurors?
    * CoA made a unilateral decision to override jury decision based on a set of assumptions it used to conclude P's theory was unreasonable, raising questions/concerns
      * Does the court overstep its role over the jury in making an inference about execution of Walmart’s cleaning policies?
      * Rule 50 stipulates that the court examine the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party - here there seem to be credibility determinations)
    * There is an unavoidable element of indeterminacy that, as a matter of social policy, might be best answered by a jury
* **Rule 50(b) - Renewed Motion**
  * Motion must be filed within 28 days of entry of judgment, and **only** available if a 50(a) motion was previously filed
  * In cases where the jury decides correctly, it eliminates the need for the motion and the risk of reversal on appeal
  * Frequently seen as a “workaround” to protection against reexamination in jury cases. Enables court to circumvent this while rendering its own judgement not withstanding the verdict because motion was raised before verdict is reached and simply continued afterwords at court's discretion
* **Rule 59 - Motion for a New Trial**
  * Standard is the discretion of the judge
  * Why would a court grant 59?
    * Incorrect trial, jury made inferences deemed unreasonable in light of available evidence
    * Attorney misconduct: improper evidence, improper invitation of jurors to bias
    * Can grant 59 motion without review
* Rule 50(b) and 59 motions must be made within 28 days of verdict

### *Dixon v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.*

P's feet get tangled in plastic binder wrap at Walmart (D) checkout line, she is seriously injured, and she sues D for negligence. P's theory is that the binder got on the floor in the morning during newspaper delivery, and that it was on the ground for 8 hours, hence D should reasonably have been discovered by store employees. Under Texas tort law, she needed to prove that D had constructive knowledge of the binder wrap and failed to exercise reasonable care in spite of that knowledge. Sole issue on appeal is whether P established sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find that D had constructive knowledge. P argues D must have had knowledge due to proximity of binder wrap to cashier. However, court holds proximity evidence alone is insufficient - must be temporal evidence showing D had enough time to exercise reasonable care. Court then rules there was **nothing in the evidentiary record that could lead a reasonable jury to believe binding was present long enough to prove constructive knowledge**. Thus, court allows JAML for D
