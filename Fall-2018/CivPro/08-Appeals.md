# Appeals

## Appealability

* Entry of final judgment marks the formalized resolution of the dispute with respect to its disposition and also creates a point of reference about timing questions and about preclusion doctrine (what factual and legal questions have been conclusively determined by these two parties that may bind them in future disputes)
  * Final judgment rule §28 USC 1291 - Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all **final decisions** of the district courts of the United States (and other territories) No appeals from non-final judgments with three primary exceptions (see 1292 and Rule 54)
    * Benefits: No constant interruption of litigation timeline and allows full development of facts that may weigh on legal question at issue
    * This comes at a cost, as court rulings at intermediate stages of litigation have significant impact and forces party to continue costly litigation where it might not be warranted, often placing significant pressure for settlement
  * Rule 54(b) Multiple claims and parties
    * Gives TC flexibility to issue a partial judgement (e.g. judgement on one of several claims) if it deems so to be in the interest of justice provides final judgement for a single issue/party in the litigation, allowing appeal to be raised without awaiting final judgement on remaining litigation
* Three main categories of exception to final judgement rule:
  * **Collateral Order Doctrine**
    * Identifies situations where issue in case implicates important values (usually constitutional or legislated value) distinct from merits of lawsuit and where in the absence of an immediate opportunity to address the issue, it would effectively lose its benefit/value. 
    * This is a narrow category. Example: Qualified immunity being improperly denied
    * Court justifies this doctrine by treating the district court’s decision on that issue as basically a “final judgment” on that issue and therefore appealable right away.
    * Internal court matters, such as discovery, do not fall within the scope of collateral order
  * **Interlocutory**- Two Avenues
    1. Section 1292(a) Request for injunctive relief
       * Most expansive review - Failure to immediately grant injunctions lead to significant/irreparable consequences to party which would be unjust
       * Preliminary injunction operates to preserve the status quo or provide relief during the pendency of litigation
         * Example: "don't clear the forest until the case is completed"
         * Is exercised frequently and appellate court obligated to hear it
    1. Section 1292(b) Discretionary appeals
       * Order involves a "controlling question of the law" as to which there are "substantial grounds for difference in opinion" and which immediate appeal of may materially advance resolution of the litigation
       * Trial court has discretion over whether this section is applicable to the question, and if so, the CoA has discretion to take for appeal
         * Neither decision is reviewable
  * **Extraordinary writs**
    * Power of federal courts to issue mandatory orders in order to preserve authority.This doctrine is sometimes available where a lower court is committing an error that goes to fundamental questions about the type of power the court is exercising, such as proceeding in a way that exceeds bounds of its legitimate authority
    * Appellant must convince the appellate court that what’s happening is qualitatively illegitimate
    * Writ of prohibition - Order to refrain from some action
    * Writ of mandamus (requires a judge to exercise judicial authority)
* Prevailing Party Doctrine: Appeal not available for those awarded **all** sought after relief
  * Why winners appeal:
    1. Could have adverse fact findings tha could impact party
    1. Could establish precedent unfavorable in future litigation
* Filing the Appeal
  * After final judgment, you have 30 days to file notice of appeal. This is enforced strictly, per the federal rules of appellate procedure
  * Preserving issues for appeal through adequate objection -	If you don’t object, you can’t appeal
  * Notice of Appeal
    * Appellant must file “notice of appeal” – document identifying party, judgment, and court
    * Rule 4(a)(1)(A) – appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of judgment (or when post-verdict motions are fully decided)
    * Other party has 14 days after to cross-appeal
  * Appellate Record: aka “The Appendix”
    * All materials from discovery and trial
* Disposition: appellate courts do not require any particular form of written resolution, whether verbal or written
  * Can reverse without opinion
* Rehearing/Rehearing En Banc
  * Parties may seek a rehearing within 14 days of appellate judgment
  * Majority of active judges on the circuit must grant the rehearing

## Standards of Review

* De Novo (Plenary)
  * Most complete review - no formal deferential to lower court. Usually applied to questions of law without any weight to lower court's ruling (i.e. tried as if new). The signature issue subject to de novo review is question of law (though this distinction isn't always clear)
* Clearly Erroneous (Clear Error)
  * Usually reserved to finding of facts if by lower court judge. Only non-deferential if there is a "definite and firm conviction" of a mistake. An assumption here is that there is in fact a right answer to the factual questions
    * If jury was trier of fact, appellate court can’t review because of 7th amendment protection. However, appellate court can review through other means such as an appeal from a ruling on a Rule 50 motion
* Abuse of Discretion
  * Review of legal rulings involving balance of factors left to discretion of trial judge. Standard is that CoA should not substitute its judgement unless the balancing of the factors falls outside the boundaries of reasonableness
  * An assumption here is that there isn’t a single right answer but rather that the the judge is invited to use its judgment in determining the best course of action
    * Also limited in decisions rendered by juries due to 7th amendment

### *Pullman-Standard v. Swint*

Civil rights lawsuit concerning the seniority process at the Pullman-Standard plant. Ps contend freight car union has a discriminatory (albeit indirectly) seniority system. TC found that there was no discriminatory intent. CoA reversed and ruled that there was, arguing "because the issue was the ultimate issue in the case, it can be subject to de novo review and not subject to standard of deference". SCOTUS grants certiorari and held that CoA did not apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. **Must defer to lower court judge's fact finding unless there is “definite and firm conviction that an error has been made.”** However, the issue of discriminatory intent was purely factual one and the CoA did not establish that there was a clear mistake in the lower courts fact finding, thus the conclusions drawn from its own independent fact finding were inappropriate.
