# Supplementing the Agreement: Implied Terms, Obligation of Good Faith, and Warranties

## Implied Terms

* Implied-in-Fact
  * A term the court finds to be "implicit" in the parties' words or conduct, though not literally expressed, is a term implied-in-fact
* Implied-by-Law
  * Terms the court doesn't find in the parties agreement, even in taking broad view, but are made part of the agreement by operation of the rules of law rather than the parties themselves
  * Example: Gap-filling provisions of UCC Article 2.
* Best or Reasonable Efforts
  * Many recent decisions follow principle recognized in *Wood* in which implied obligation to use reasonable efforts prevents vague or indefinite promise from being illusory
  * Influenced UCC ยง2-306, which imposes a "best efforts" obligation in cases where the contract calls for exclusive dealing
  * Most courts define "best efforts" in terms of reasonableness or diligence, which takes into consideration the parties capabilities
* Default Rules? (pg. 480)

### [*Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff- Gordon*]

P and D have agreement where P has exclusive right to sell/license D's fabric designs, subject to her approval, and in return D would get one half of all profits derived. The right was to last at least 1 year, but D breaks agreement. P sues for damages and D contends there was no contract because P was not bound to anything. Court asserts that a promise may be unexpressed in a writing, but implied so as to establish a contract. The court held that P's promise to pay half of profits was an implied promise to use reasonable efforts in order to bring such profit into existence. Unless P made reasonable effort to do so, D could never get anything. Thus, the implied promise is what induced D's promise. Court rules there was mutuality of obligation and claim for breach was improperly dismissed by the lower court.

### [*Liebel v. Raynor Manufacturing Co.*]

P and D reach agreement for exclusive dealer-distributorship where P becomes exclusive distributor of D's products and D is the exclusive supplier of the products to P. Length of the agreement was for an indefinite amount of time. After sales decrease, D notifies P that the relationship is being terminated and P sues for breach. Trial court awards summary judgement for P on grounds that indefinite agreement could be terminated by either party and any time. CoA applies UCC, citing case law in which similar dealership agreements were treated for the sale of goods. UCC provides that in the absence of specific time provisions, reasonable notification to the other party is required in order to terminate the contract. Court rules that, in light of the significant investment P had in the agreement, the notice given was not reasonable as a matter of law. Court vacated the summary judgement.

## Warranties

### Bayliner

* Express warranties by the seller created:
  **1. Any affirmation of fact/promise made by the seller relating to the goods becomes part of the basis of the bargain
  2. Any description of the goods which becomes part of the basis of the bargain**
  * In these cases, an express warranty is created that the goods shall conform to the description/affirmation of fact
  * Court ruled D didn't breach express warranty because boat in the descriptions was no the specific boat purchased by P.
  * **Statements purporting to be the sellers opinion commendation about the goods do not create a warranty.**
  * Thus, P's statement about the quality of the boats performance did not create an express warranty.
* **For a good to be merchantable, it must be such that it would "pass without objection in the trade" and "are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods are used"**
  * First element concerns whether significant segment of the buying public would object to buy the goods
  * Second element concerned with goods are "reasonably capable of performing their ordinary functions"
  * Court determined there was no evidence that the boat sold to P was not merchantable under that standard
* Implied warranty for fitness of purpose is created if seller **has reason to know any particular purpose for which goods are required and the buyer is relying on seller's skills or judgement to select suitable goods**
  * Thus to establish implied warranty for fitness of purpose, **buyer must prove he made known to seller the particular purpose for which the goods were required**
  * Court found D did not establish P had knowledge of the fact that a boat incapable of traveling faster than 30 mph was unacceptable, thus no breach

### Speight

* Implied warranty of workmanlike construction is judicially created doctrine implemented to protect home buyers against address inequity existing between them and experienced builders.
  * Building must be constructed in a reasonably good and workmanlike manner
  * Independent of of the contract, thus not extinguished after builder's performance is complete.
  * Must be reasonably fit for the intended purposes.
  * **Buyer must show that house was constructed to be occupied as a home, that it was purchased from the party who constructed it for sale, that it was not fit at the time of purchase, and the buyer was both unaware at the time of purchase and suffered damages.**
* Application of this warranty to subsequent purchasers varies by jurisdiction
  * Court identifies that the same public policy justifications support extending this warranty to subsequent buyers, who are in no better position to discover defects as those who purchase from builder.
* Court argues claim not barred by statue of limitations because P could not have gained actual or imputed knowledge when the statute of limitations expired.
