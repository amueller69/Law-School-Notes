# Supplementing the Agreement: Implied Terms, Obligation of Good Faith, and Warranties

## Implied Terms

* Why imply terms?
  * Fairness considerations
  * Off-the-rack convenience: probably what parties would’ve chosen if had negotiated; process of agreement-making less costly if can rely on background terms—inefficient to continue bargaining
  * Eliminate most problems of lack of consideration or lack of mutuality
* Implied-in-Fact
  * A term the court finds to be "implicit" in the parties' words or past conduct, though not literally expressed, is a term implied-in-fact
* Implied-by-Law
  * Terms the court doesn't find in the parties agreement, even in taking broad view, but are made part of the agreement by operation of the rules of law rather than the parties themselves
  * Example: Gap-filling provisions of UCC Article 2.
* Best or Reasonable Efforts
  * Many recent decisions follow principle recognized in *Wood* in which implied obligation to use reasonable efforts prevents vague or indefinite promise from being illusory
  * Influenced UCC §2-306, which imposes a "best efforts" obligation in cases where the contract calls for exclusive dealing
  * Most courts define "best efforts" in terms of reasonableness or diligence, which takes into consideration the parties capabilities
* Default Rules? (pg. 480)
* UCC
  * § 2-306(1) – if term is “how much buyer can sell” or “how much seller can manufacture” must be measured in terms of good faith (commercial reasonableness)
  * § 2-306(2) – if buyer and seller have exclusive dealings, each side must give best effort to supply and sell
  * § 2-309. Absence of Specific Time Provisions; Notice of Termination.
      1. If not agreed upon, the time for shipment/delivery/any other action under a K shall be “a reasonable time”, which is dependent on the circumstances and particular industry of the dealings. This also extends to time for payment
      1. Where K provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration, it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party. Period must be reasonable enough so as to allow non-terminating party to seek substitute arrangements
      1. Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable
         * *Raynor* court - "Requirement of a reasonable notification does not relate to the method of giving notice, but to the circumstances under which the notice is given and the extent of advanced warning of termination that the notification gives"

### *Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff- Gordon*

P and D have agreement where P has exclusive right to sell/license D's fabric designs, subject to her approval, and in return D would get one half of all profits derived. The right was to last at least 1 year, but D breaks agreement. P sues for damages and D contends there was no contract because P was not bound to anything. Court asserts that a promise may be unexpressed in a writing, but implied so as to establish a contract. The court held that P's promise to pay half of profits was an implied promise to use reasonable efforts in order to bring such profit into existence. **An implied obligation to use reasonable efforts will prevent a somewhat indefinite promise from being illusory.** Unless P made reasonable effort to do so, D could never get anything and contract would have made very little sense. Thus, the implied promise is what induced D's promise. Court rules there was mutuality of obligation and claim for breach was improperly dismissed by the lower court.

### *Liebel v. Raynor Manufacturing Co.*

P and D reach agreement for exclusive dealer-distributorship where P becomes exclusive distributor of D's products and D is the exclusive supplier of the products to P. Length of the agreement was for an indefinite amount of time. After sales decrease, D notifies P that the relationship is being terminated and P sues for breach. Trial court awards summary judgement for P on grounds that indefinite agreement could be terminated by either party and any time. CoA applies UCC, citing case law in which similar dealership agreements were treated for the sale of goods. UCC provides that **in the absence of specific time provisions, reasonable notification to the other party, within a reasonable time period, is required in order to terminate the contract**. Court rules that, in light of the significant investment P had in the agreement, the notice given was not reasonable as a matter of law. P did not have enough time to sell off inventory. Thus, court vacated the summary judgement.

## The Implied Obligation of Good Faith

* Disputes over parties failure to act in good faith arise when their conduct is not forbidden or, in some cases, even expressly permitted, but nonetheless improper and actionable
  * Background principle: **neither party shall do anything to prevent the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the K**
  * Good faith does not apply to bargaining process - different set of standards guiding this type of conduct
  * Polices against opportunistic behavior
  * Protects the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties
* All contracts are deemed to include an obligation of good faith binding on both parties
  * UCC § 1-304 "Every contract or duty within its cope imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement"
  * R2d §205: Duty of Good Faith + Fair Dealing: Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith + fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement
* "Excluder" view of good faith
  * Good faith does not have a definition of its own, but rather serves to exclude a wide range of "bad faith" conduct
  * Concerned more with refraining from certain conduct than in adhering to a standard of positive conduct
* UCC
  * § 1-201: Good faith means honesty in fact (subjective standard) AND the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing (objective standard)
    * NEED BOTH
    * Some states don’t require reasonable commercial standards for non-merchants, just honesty-in-fact
  * § 2-103: Good faith in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade
  * § 1-304 Obligation of Good Faith
    * Every contract or duty w/in the UCC imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement
      * Does not create an additional duty that can be independently breached and become actionable
      * Instead, directs courts to interpret terms of contracts w/in the commercial context in which they are created to determine if terms were breached (Was P deprived of the benefit of the bargain? Did D destroy P’s right to fruits of the K?)
  * UCC §1-302 - Variation by Agreement
    * Under the UCC , provisions can be varied by agreement but obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care may not be disclaimed by agreement
    * However, the parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable (including time limits/deadlines for performance)

### *Morin v. Baystone Construction*

Auto manufacturer hired D to build a new addition to its factory. D hired P to complete the aluminum walls for the addition. Pursuant to the contract, the walls were to be made out of class/grade of aluminum with distinctive appearance. K also provided all work was subject to final approval by auto manufacturer's agent. Walls put up but don't have desired appearance so agent rejected them. D hired another contractor to replace them and these were accepted. D refused to pay P for the balance of the contract price Morin successfully brought suit. D appealed. Court holds that reasonable person standard is employed to approximate what parties would have expressly provided with respect to a contingency they did not see, had they forseen it. Thus, because reasonableness is not always accurate guide to party's intentions in all cases (matter of personal taste), it is not used in all cases. **In a contract containing a standard owner’s satisfaction clause, satisfaction is judged by a reasonable person standard when the contract involves commercial quality, operative fitness or mechanical utility which other knowledgeable persons can judge; in the alternative, satisfaction depends on the owner’s good faith judgment when the contract involves personal aesthetics or fancy.** The contract in this case falls in the former category (the aesthetic qualities of the aluminum factory walls are clearly secondary to the functional ones). Thus, when judged by standard of commercial reasonableness, P satisfied its contractual obligations and is entitled to recovery.

### *Locke v. Warner Bros*

P, an actress, enters contract with D, a movie studio, to get first look on any of P's movie ideas. $750,000 guaranteed over 3 yrs. D never options to pick up any of her ideas. P contends that D never had any intent in exercising the option when it made the deal, nor did it make any serious attempts to consider them - its sole purposes for entering into K was to help on of its employees settle litigation w/ P. Court holds that in **K that confers discretionary power to one party that affects rights of another, a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance to fair dealing**. Since this is a matter involving tastes/judgement, subjective standard of good faith, applied by the trier of fact, is controlling here. Even though K expressly provides right for D to pass up on P's ideas, categorically rejecting them irrespective of their merits is conduct in violation of this obligation of good faith. Evidence of D's refusal to work with P is a triable issue of material fact, hence summary judgement was inappropriate.

## Warranties

* Traditional rule: caveat emptor - let the buyer beware
  * Seller bore nor responsibility at all for the quality of the product he was selling unless he expressly guaranteed it or gave a “warranty”
* American courts gradually reversed rule of caveat emptor by imposing obligations on the seller as to the quality of the good she was selling
  * Implied warranties were obligations not based on actual agreement of the parties but instead imposed by law on the seller
* Parol evidence rule doesn’t create a problem for implied warranties in UCC sale of goods context but comes into play if trying to claim there was an oral express warranty not reflected in written agreement (may be allowed in if K only partially integrated)
* Overwhelming majority of states now recognize implied warranty of habitability in residential leases
* Outside the contexts of goods and homes, warranties are either express or non-existent
* UCC
  * § 2-313 – Express Warranty
    1. Oral or written statement of fact that forms basis of the bargain
    1. Presume that if seller opens their mouth, it is relied upon. Seller has to prove that buyer did not base bargain on this promise
    1. Justified b/c of difficulty for buyer to prove and b/c seller need not open their mouth
  * § 2-314 – Implied Warranty of Merchantability
    1. MERCHANTS ONLY
    1. Must be fit for the ordinary purposes for which the goods are used
    1. To disclaim, must explicitly mention merchantability
    1. Selling “as is” may disclaim implied warranty
  * § 2-315 – Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose

### Bayliner

* Express warranties by the seller created:
  **1. Any affirmation of fact/promise made by the seller relating to the goods becomes part of the basis of the bargain
  2. Any description of the goods which becomes part of the basis of the bargain**
  * In these cases, an express warranty is created that the goods shall conform to the description/affirmation of fact
  * Court ruled D didn't breach express warranty because boat in the descriptions was no the specific boat purchased by P.
  * **Statements purporting to be the sellers opinion commendation about the goods do not create a warranty.**
  * Thus, P's statement about the quality of the boats performance did not create an express warranty.
* **For a good to be merchantable, it must be such that it would "pass without objection in the trade" and "are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods are used"**
  * First element concerns whether significant segment of the buying public would object to buy the goods
  * Second element concerned with goods are "reasonably capable of performing their ordinary functions"
  * Court determined there was no evidence that the boat sold to P was not merchantable under that standard
* Implied warranty for fitness of purpose is created if seller **has reason to know any particular purpose for which goods are required and the buyer is relying on seller's skills or judgement to select suitable goods**
  * Thus to establish implied warranty for fitness of purpose, **buyer must prove he made known to seller the particular purpose for which the goods were required**
  * Court found D did not establish P had knowledge of the fact that a boat incapable of traveling faster than 30 mph was unacceptable, thus no breach

### Speight

* Implied warranty of workmanlike construction is judicially created doctrine implemented to protect home buyers against address inequity existing between them and experienced builders.
  * Building must be constructed in a reasonably good and workmanlike manner
  * Independent of of the contract, thus not extinguished after builder's performance is complete.
  * Must be reasonably fit for the intended purposes.
  * **Buyer must show that house was constructed to be occupied as a home, that it was purchased from the party who constructed it for sale, that it was not fit at the time of purchase, and the buyer was both unaware at the time of purchase and suffered damages.**
* Application of this warranty to subsequent purchasers varies by jurisdiction
  * Court identifies that the same public policy justifications support extending this warranty to subsequent buyers, who are in no better position to discover defects as those who purchase from builder.
* Court argues claim not barred by statue of limitations because P could not have gained actual or imputed knowledge when the statute of limitations expired.
