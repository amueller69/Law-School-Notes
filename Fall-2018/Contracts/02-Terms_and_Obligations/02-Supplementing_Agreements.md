# Supplementing the Agreement: Implied Terms, Obligation of Good Faith, and Warranties

## Implied Terms

* Implied-in-Fact
  * A term the court finds to be "implicit" in the parties' words or conduct, though not literally expressed, is a term implied-in-fact
* Implied-by-Law
  * Terms the court doesn't find in the parties agreement, even in taking broad view, but are made part of the agreement by operation of the rules of law rather than the parties themselves

### [*Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff- Gordon*]

P and D have agreement where P has exclusive right to sell/license D's fabric designs, subject to her approval, and in return D would get one half of all profits derived. The right was to last at least 1 year, but D breaks agreement. P sues for damages and D contends there was no contract because P was not bound to anything. Court asserts that a promise may be unexpressed in a writing, but implied so as to establish a contract.
