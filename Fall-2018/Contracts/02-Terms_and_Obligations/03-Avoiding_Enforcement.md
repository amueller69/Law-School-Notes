# Avoiding Enforcement - Incapacity, Bargaining Misconduct, Unconscionability, and Public Policy

## Incapacity

* Infancy/Minority Doctrine
  * **Traditional Rule**: A minor who disaffirmed a contract for the purchase of a good is not required to make restitution to the seller for substantial diminution in the goods value absent a showing that the minor misrepresented his age or willfully destroyed the property. The fact that the minor has benefited from a service/good in the past is not grounds to deny right of avoidance.
    * Limitation on necessaries. Minor liable for the value of items one needs to live (i.e. food, clothing, and shelter)
    * Court views obligation to make restitution is to bind minor to obligation they have privilege to avoid under the law
    * *Dodson v. Shrader* departs from this traditional rule
  * Restatement (Second) ยง14 - Infants
    * > Unless a statue provides otherwise, a natural person has the capacity to incur only voidable contractual duties unitl the beginning of the day before the person's 18th birthday
    * Comment c -If consideration has been dissipated while in the minor's possession, the other party is without remedy unless the infant ratifies the contract after coming of age
* Incapacity due to mental illness
  * **Modern approach** asserts "where a person has some understanding of a particular transaction which is affected by mental illness or defects, the controlling consideration is whether the transaction in its result is one which a reasonably competent person might have made"
    * Inquiry into capacity focuses on understanding or conduct at time of transaction only
    * Contrasted with Minority Doctrine - Whereas minor can generally disaffirm even if restoration cannot be made, mentally incompetent person is required to make restoration unless special circumstances are present
  * Restatement (Second) ยง15
    * Person incurs voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness if he is unable to reasonably understand the nature/consequences of the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition
    * Where other party is without knowledge or of reason to know of the mental illness or defect, the power of avoidance terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be unjust
  * **Traditional "cognitive" test** is an inquiry into a persons capacity to understand the nature of a transaction
* Contract can be rendered void for incapacity in other contexts, such as intoxication, if demonstrated that the other party in a transaction had reason to know of the other's inability to understand the nature and consequences of the transaction

### *Dodson v. Shrader*

P is a minor who purchases truck from D. Truck experienced engine issues and ultimately blew up. P tried to rescind purchase and requested refund, but D refused. P brought action seeking to avoid contract under infancy doctrine. In balancing rights of innocent merchants and protection of minors, court adopts rule that **minor is not permitted to recover full amount without allowing compensation for any depreciation or damage to the purchase while in their possession. Where the minor has not been subject to overreach or undue influence and the contract is fail/reasonable, the minor may recover the purchase price less reasonable compensation to the vendor for the use of, depreciation or willful/negligent damage to the goods while in the minor's possession.**

### *Sparrow v. Demonico*

P claims that mediation agreement was unenforceable because it she had experienced a mental breakdown at the time of assenting and lacked the capacity to authorize such an agreement. Court acknowledges the possibility of avoiding a contract due to mental/emotional related incapacity at the time of the transaction, even if the condition is not chronic or persistent. However, court also recognized the placement of **burden on P to provide medical evidence supporting claim of incapacity** is important to guard against fraudulent claims or plaintiffs who innocently, yet erroneously, convince themselves of suffering distress. Since P failed to provide medical evidence of her condition or evidence that her condition could feasibly result from the alleged cause, the court held there is no evidence that a reasonably competent person would not have entered into it.

## Duress and Undue Influence

* Basic formulation of standard for duress
  1. One party involuntarily accepted terms of another
  1. Circumstances permitted no other alternative
     * "No choice but to agree to the other party's terms or face serious financial hardship"
     * "What constitutes a reasonable alternative is a question of fact depending on the circumstances of each case"
  1. Such circumstances were result of wrongful coercive acts of the other party ("actual inducement")
     * No analytically precise standard of "wrongfulness" is provided, but courts have held that such an act need not be illegal.
       * Can be a breach of the duty of good faith or fair dealing
       * Would harm the recipient and would not significantly benefit the party making the threat
     * In the context of economic duress, there must thus be a showing that duress resulted from D's wrongful and oppressive conduct and not by P's necessities
* Other formulations emphasize the suppression of ones free will and judgement
* Those claiming coercion typically seek to avoid the contract or any modifications/settlements

### *Totem v. Alyeska Pipeline*

P and D in contractual relationship to transport pipeline construction materials. After several unexpected delays, D terminated the contract. P submits termination invoices to which D is unable to provide a timeline for payment. Strapped for cash and under pressure from several other creditors, P agrees to settlement for substantially less than original invoices. P later brings action seeking full payment under claim that the release was agreed to under economic duress and that P had full knowledge of P's vulnerable state and used it as leverage to reach a settlement. Court rules that the claim economic duress, P must demonstrate that it had no reasonable choice but to agree to the other party's terms or face serious financial hardship and that the lack of reasonable alternatives was the result of D's wrongful conduct. Court found the circumstances surrounding the claim, that D exploited P's impending bankruptcy to reach a settlement, might reasonably support finding of D's conduct as wrongful. Thus court concludes the claim is improperly disposed off in the lower court's granting of summary judgement.

## Misrepresentation and Nondisclosure

* Rescission
  * Equitable remedy commonly used is instances of misrepresentation and nondisclosure
    * In such cases under modern law, victim has choice between tort action for damages or avoiding the contract by way of rescission
  * Judicial return of the parties to the status quo that existed before the contract was formed
    * Requires injured party to return any money or property he has received
    * May not be available where property has since been transferred to another party
* Fraudulent Inducement:
  1. Defendant made false representations as a statement of existing and material fact
  1. Defendant know representations to be false or made them recklessly without knowledge
  1. Defendant made representations intentionally for the purpose of inducing another party to act upon them
  1. Other party reasonably relied and acted upon representations - a representation is material when so substantial as to influence the other party
  1. Other party sustained damages
* Fraud by Silence (Fraudulent Nondisclosure):
  1. Defendant had knowledge of material facts not reasonably discoverable by other party
  1. Defendant under obligation to communicate such facts
  1. Defendant intentionally failed to do so
  1. Plaintiff reasonably relied on defendants representations as being complete and sustained damages as a result
  * Court may take into account differences in the levels of intelligence between parties, the nature of the relationship, and the degree to which information is readily discoverable or verifiable.
* Negligent Misrepresentation
  1. Person supplying false information has failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining/communicating the information
  1. Person relying upon false information is the intended beneficiary of the information supplied
  1. Damages are suffered by relying party in transaction that negligent party is trying to influence
* Restatement
  * Second ยง164 - A contract is voidable if a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying.
    * "Material" misrepresentations may be made innocently but nonetheless render contract unavoidable
  * Second ยง162 - Defines fraudulent to include an assertion made as true but without knowledge or confidence by the maker whether it is true or false, and thus may include statements that are made recklessly or negligently
    * An opinion defines an express of a belief, without certainty, as the existence of a fact. These are typically given a certain degree of leeway, but statements of opinion may be actionable in certain relationships (e.g. fiduciary, expert reliance, etc.)
    * An opinion can also be actionable for misrepresentation if it can be demonstrated that it was not genuinely held

### Syester v. Banta

Over period of several years, 68 year old widow pays D in return over 3000 hours of dance lessons. D's inducement of the sale of the lessons is borderline exploitative and fraudulent. After P terminates relationship with P and expresses intent to bring action, D uses questionable tactics in order to sign a release containing terms which, if signed in good faith, would bar all claims related to the transactions between D and P. D asserts the terms of the release as a defense, but jury awards judgement in favor of P. Court asserts **a settlement/release fairly entered into is binding and enforceable unless there exists fraud in its execution**. To claim fraud, one must establish (1) a representation was made, (2) it was false, (3) it was material, (4) the party making the statement knew it was false, (6) the injured party relied upon the statement in entering into the contract Upon appeal, CoA determined that the jury was properly instructed and, as a questions of fact, court held there was reasonable evidence that might reasonably support finding of misrepresentation if believed by the jury. Finally, court affirmed the award of punitive damages, citing the "greed and avariciousness" demonstrated by D.

### Stechschulte v. Jennings

D enters agreement to sell home to P. Over duration of D's ownership, there had been issues with water leaks to which D consulted with a contractor and ultimately applied temporary solution. In disclosure addendum section related to leakage, repairs, and stains, D failed to indicate these issues. Instead, he suggested that full warranty repairs had corrected the issue. P signs disclosure section with terms acknowledging the claims were made to the best of the non-expert seller's knowledge and that there is no reliance on any representations except those fully set forth in writing. P takes ownership of the home and then brings action against D after experiencing leakage. D claims the Buyer Acknowledgement as a defense. Lower court awards summary judgement in favor of D. State supreme court holds that P's acknowledgement there their was no reliance on representations made by the seller does not extend do the disclosures made in (or intentionally omitted from) the disclosure form. Thus, the Buyer Acknowledgement form does not protect D against failure to make accurate and complete disclosures. Court found that D's statements and omitted facts in the disclosure reasonably support the contention that D failed to make complete and accurate representations. Thus, court rules summary judgement was improperly awarded and remands all claims to lower court.

## Unconscionability

### *Williams v. Walker-Thomas*

Furniture store (D) leases items to customers who make series of installment payments. Ownership is not conferred until final payment is made, at which point title passes to customer. Lease agreements contained unique provision that every time a new item was leased by a customer, balance would be dispersed across all items previously leased. This would allow D to repossess all previous purchase by that customer. P buys stereo and defaults, resulting in D repossessing all items. P sues on unconscionability grounds and trial court grants judgement for D. CoA rejects lower court holding that it lacked power to deny enforcement on unconscionability grounds. Court defines unconscionability as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties combined with terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party. CoA adopts rule that **contracts containing element of unconscionability should not be enforced and the court should determine this in light of the circumstances**.
