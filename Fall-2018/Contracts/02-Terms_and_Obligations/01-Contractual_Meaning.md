## Parol Evidence Rule

* Parol Evidence - Evidence, either written or oral, that is extrinsic to a written agreement
  * Under rules of evidence commonly employed in US courts, any evidence to be prima facie admissible into court must be "relevant" -- rationally probative of some fact material to the parties' dispute
* Parole Evidence Rule - Rule that such evidence will be excluded from the trier of fact. However, the rule has many exceptions and intricacies
  * When the parties have mutually agreed to incorporate (or “integrate”) a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party is allowed to contradict or supplement that written agreement w/ extrinsic evidence (written or oral) or prior agreements or negotiations between them
  * Not a rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive law
  * Does not define was is affirmatively admissible, but only operates to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible as rationally probative of some fact at issue
  * Rationale:
    * To avoid inconvenience and injustice that would result if extrinsic evidence were admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement
    * Enforces a clear ex ante approach to what is a contract
    * Makes court more efficient because there is less evidence to contemplate
* Complete Integration - When parties have mutually agreed to integrate a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party will be permitted to contradict or supplement terms with parol evidence
* Partial Integration - When a writing is intended to be final only with respect to a part of their agreement, the agreement may be supplemented by external evidence, but terms cannot be contradicted
  * Rather than find a contract to be partially integrated, Court more frequently treats it as complete but with ambiguity, allowing PE to be admitted
* The correct application of the parol evidence rule requires that the court first determine whether the writing in question is intended to be a final expression of the parties agreement. How is this determined?
  * Four Corners Rule - Question must be determined from the four quarters of the writing without resort to extrinsic evidence. A substantial number of jurisdictions till generally adhere to this approach
  * Others jurisdictions have adopted the contextual approach that is reflected in R2d - A writing cannot of itself prove its own completeness and wide latitude must be allowed for inquiry into circumstances bearing on the intention of the parties
    * Corbin - A finding of integration should always depend on the actual intent of the parties
* **Exceptions to Parol Evidence Rule**
  * Interpreting ambiguity - Parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of aiding the interpretation of ambiguity in a contract. While traditionally only applicable when contractual terms were ambiguous prima facie, modern courts are more likely to admit evidence that a party offers to demonstrate special meaning of terms that don't appear unclear on their face. Rather than determine whether an agreement is only partially integrated, courts are more likely to treat it as complete and then rely on the ambiguity exception.
  * Subsequent agreements - Rule does not apply to agreements made after the execution of the writing
  * Oral conditions precedent - Parol evidence rule not applicable to evidence purported to show that a written agreement's effectiveness was subject to an oral condition
  * Defenses to formation - Rule does not apply to evidence offered to show contract was invalid, such as due to fraud (both in the execution and inducement), duress, undue influence, incapacity, mistake, or illegality
  * Reformation - Rule does not bar evidence used to establish that part of the agreement was omitted due to mistake and, thus, a party is entitled to a remedy such as judicial reformation of the contract. Generally, one must show clear and convincing evidence that both parties intended to include the term in their written agreement
  * Collateral agreements - Traditionally, the exception only applied to agreements about a subject distinct from the transaction in the writing. However, modern courts more are more flexible and may justify admission of parol evidence even if related to the transaction in writing. Intersects with partial integration in instances where additional agreement is not furnished with separate consideration. UCC only excludes this evidence if the writing is clearly intended to be a complete and exhaustive statement of all terms
* Merger Clause - states that the writing is intended to be final and complete; all prior understandings have been “merged” into or superseded by the final writing. Purpose is to tell courts we intend this to be a fully integrated agreement
  * Some courts give full acknowledgement to these clauses and do not allow PE
  * Other courts do not, especially in a contract of adhesion or a situation where there is unequal bargaining

### Rules

* R2d
  * §210 - Completely and Partially Integrated Agreements
    1. A completely integrated agreement is an integrated agreement adopted by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
    1. A partially integrated agreement is an integrated agreement other than a completely integrated agreement
    1. Whether an agreement is completely or partially integrated is to be determined by the court as a question preliminary to determination of a question of interpretation or to application of the parol evidence rule
  * §214 - Evidence of Prior or Contemporaneous Agreements and Negotiations
    * Agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous w/ the adoption of a writing are admissible in evidence to establish
      * That the writing is or is not an integrated agreement
      * That the integrated agreement, if any, is completely or partially integrated
      * The meaning of the writing, whether or not integrated
      * Illegality, fraud, duress, mistake, lack of consideration, or other invalidating cause
      * Ground for granting or denying rescission, reformation, specific performance, or other remedy
  * §215 - Contradiction of Integrated Terms
    * Except as stated in the preceding Section, where there is a binding agreement, either completely or partially integrated, evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations is not admissible in evidence to contradict a term of the writing
  * §216 - Contradiction of Integrated Terms
    * Evidence of a consistent additional term is admissible to supplement an integrated agreement unless the court finds that the agreement was completely integrated'
    * An agreement is not completely integrated if the writing omits a consistent additional agreed term which is
      1. Agreed to for separate consideration, or
      1. Such a term as in the circumstances might naturally be omitted from the writing
  * §217 - Integrated Agreement Subject to Oral Requirement of a Condition
    * Where the parties to a written agreement agree orally that performance of the agreement is subject to the occurrence of a stated condition, the agreement is not integrated with respect to the oral condition
* UCC §2-202 - Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence
  * Terms w/ respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented
    * By course of dealing or trade usage or by course of performance
    * By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement

### Decision Tree

* Is there a writing?
  * If not, PE rule does not apply
* What is the level of integration (standard used to determine this varies by jurisdiction (4 corners v. contextual approach))?
  * If partially integrated, exclude PE of contradicting terms
  * If completely integrated, exclude both supplemental and contradicting terms
  * If neither, PE rule does not apply

### *Thompson v. Libby*

P and D have agreed on terms for sale of logs subject to a written agreement. P brings action claiming quality of logs breached warranty that, while not included in the writing, was agreed to orally. Lower court admits evidence. State supreme court holds that the writing, on its face, appears to be a complete expression of the entire agreement. Though recognizing even completely integrated agreements may require external evidence to help reach a better understanding of contractual language, **no ambiguity exists in the writing at issue and hence PE is to be excluded (four corners rule)**. Additionally, it rejects  application of the "collateral agreement" exception, as a quality warranty is a term of the sale and not a subject distinct from the writing. Thus, the court rules the lower court erred in admitting the parol evidence.

### *Taylor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile*

Insurance company (D) provides representation for P in suit arising out of car accident, though court enters judgement against P for an amount in excess of his policy limits. P sues D for bad faith in failing to settle matters within policy limits. D moves for summary judgement on grounds that P had signed release which waived any potential contractual claims against D. Trial court denies D's motion, holding the contractual language was ambiguous and parol evidence is needed. Jury awards judgement in favor of P, but CoA finds no ambiguity and that parol evidence was improperly admitted. State supreme court holds that it is important, when interpreting contract, that it attempt to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time of contractual formation. Thus, the court rejects rule that writing must be ambiguous on its face in order for PE to be admitted. **If a judge considers the offered external evidence and it supports conclusion that the contractual language is reasonably susceptible to differing interpretations, the evidence is admissible to help determine the intended meaning**. It ruled that external evidence supported P's contention that the contractual claims waived in the release didn't extend to bad faith claims and that there were multiple reasonable interpretations of the language. Hence, the court agreed with the trial court and vacated CoA's decision.
