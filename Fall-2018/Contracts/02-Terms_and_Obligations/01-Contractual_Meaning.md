# The meaning of the Agreement

## Interpretation

## Parol Evidence Rule

* Parol Evidence - Evidence, either written or oral, that is extrinsic to a written agreement
* Parole Evidence Rule - Rule that such evidence will be excluded from the trier of fact. However, the rule has many exceptions and intricacies
* Complete Integration - When parties have mutually agreed to integrate a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party will be permitted to contradict or supplement terms with parol evidence
* Partial Integration - When a writing is intended to be final only with respect to **a part**  of their agreement, the agreement may be supplemented by external evidence, but terms cannot be contradicted.
* Exceptions to Parol Evidence Rule
  * Interpreting ambiguity - Parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of aiding the interpretation of ambiguity in a contract. While traditionally only applicable when contractual terms were ambiguous prima facie, modern courts are more likely to admit evidence that a party offers to demonstrate special meaning of terms that don't appear unclear on their face. Rather than determine whether an agreement is only partially integrated, courts are more likely to treat it as complete and then rely on the ambiguity exception.
  * Subsequent agreements - Rule does not apply to agreements made after the execution of the writing
  * Oral conditions precedent - Parol evidence rule not applicable to evidence purported to show that a written agreement's effectiveness was subject to an oral condition
  * Defenses to formation - Rule does not apply to evidence offered to show contract was invalid, such as due to fraud (both in the execution and inducement), duress, undue influence, incapacity, mistake, or illegality
  * Reformation - Rule does not bar evidence used to establish that part of the agreement was omitted due to mistake and, thus, a party is entitled to a remedy such as judicial reformation of the contract. Generally, one must show clear and convincing evidence that both parties intended to include the term in their written agreement
  * Collateral agreements - Traditionally, the exception only applied to agreements about a subject distinct from the transaction in the writing. However, modern courts more are more flexible and may justify admission of parol evidence even if related to the transaction in writing. Intersects with partial integration in instances where additional agreement is not furnished with separate consideration. UCC only excludes this evidence if the writing is clearly intended to be a complete and exhaustive statement of all terms

### *Thompson v. Libby*

P and D have agreed on terms for sale of logs subject to a written agreement. P brings action claiming quality of logs breached warranty that, while not included in the writing, was agreed to orally. Lower court admits evidence. State supreme court holds that the writing, on its face, appears to be a complete expression of the entire agreement. Though recognizing even completely integrated agreements may require external evidence to help reach a better understanding of contractual language, no ambiguity exists in the writing at issue. Additionally, it rejects  application of the "collateral agreement" exception, as a quality warranty is a term of the sale and not a subject distinct from the writing. Thus, the court rules the lower court erred in admitting the parol evidence.

### *Taylor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile*

Insurance company (D) provides representation for P in suit arising out of car accident, though court enters judgement against P for an amount in excess of his policy limits. P sues D for bad faith in failing to settle matters within policy limits. D moves for summary judgement on grounds that P had signed release which waived any potential contractual claims against D. Trial court denies D's motion, holding the contractual language was ambiguous and parol evidence is needed. Jury awards judgement in favor of P, but CoA finds no ambiguity and that parol evidence was improperly admitted. State supreme court holds that if judge considers the offered external evidence and it supports conclusion that the contractual language is reasonably susceptible to differing interpretations the evidence is admissible to help determine the intended meaning. It ruled that external evidence supported P's contention that the contractual claims waived in the release didn't extend to bad faith claims and that there were multiple reasonable interpretations of the language. Hence, the court agreed with the trial court and vacated CoA's decision.
