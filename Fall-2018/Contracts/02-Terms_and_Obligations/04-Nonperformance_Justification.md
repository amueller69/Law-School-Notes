# Justifications for Nonperformance

## Changed Circumstances: Impossibility, Impracticability, and Frustration

---

## Modification

* Consideration for contract modification
  * UCC and CISG generally do not require more consideration for modification
  * R2d will require consideration for modification of contractual duties
* Pre-existing duty rule
  * Merely promising to perform an existing obligation will not serve as valid consideration for additional return compensation from the other party
  * Today, courts accept even a small/modest addition/alteration of performance as enough to satisfy rule
* R2d
  * § 73 – Cannot modify w/out consideration. Performing a legal duty already owed to a promisor, where there is no honest dispute about what the original bargain intended, is NOT consideration. But a similar performance is consideration if it is different from what was required by the duty in a way that reflects more than a pretense of bargain
  * § 89 – Modification of Executory Contract
    * Promise modifying duty under K is binding if:
      1. If it is a fair and equitable modification in view of the difference in circumstances anticipated and actual (e.g. forces of nature that complicate performance); OR
      1. If it is allowed by statute; OR
      1. To the extent that justice requires enforcement where party materially + justifiably changed his position in reliance on the promise (neglected in *AK Packers*)
* UCC
  * § 2-209 – Modification, Rescission, and Waiver
    1. Modification does not need new consideration except where special circumstances (good faith still applies; reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade; modification without legit commercial reason and extortion are barred)
    1. Agreements that exclude modification unless in writing cannot be rescinded or changed unless mutually consented to in writing
    1. Must satisfy Statute of Frauds
    1. May operate as waiver if does not modify correctly
    1. May retract waiver unless there has been detrimental reliance or lack of notice of retraction
* CISG
  * Art. 29
    1. Contract may be termed or modified by agreement, no need for additional consideration
    1. However, may not waive the written requirement unless there is detrimental reliance on it

### *Alaska Packers v. Domenico*

Contract for services whereby P's man a fishing vessel from San Francisco to AK and work fishing season. Contract paid base salary plus piece rate on fish caught. In middle of performance, Ps stopped work and demanded compensation be doubled. D acquiesces and work resumes. At end of season, D only compensates P according to the original contractual terms. P argues both suspended performance and demands were justified because D deliberately equipped ship with bad nets to prevent paying for excess fish that would be written of as spoilage due to limited production capacity. Question for CoA was whether or not the modified terms of the contract were supported by sufficient consideration. CoA holds that D consented to demands without consideration, as it was based upon agreement for P to render exact same services that it was already contractually obligated to perform. **Where parties enter a new agreement under which one party agrees to do no more than he was already obligated to do under an existing contract, the new agreement is unenforceable for lack of consideration.** Additionally, this can't construed as a voluntary waiver of breach of the original contract and agreement to a new one because it was coerced by the non-performing party. Thus, CoA rules there are no grounds for legally enforcing modified terms of the contract and the original terms, which D satisfied, control the contract.

### *Kelsey-Hayes Co. v. Galtaco Casting*

P has 3 year agreement with D for castings used in auto parts. D facing financial trouble and informs P of 30% increase in the castings that is necessary to keep operating. If P does not consent, it will lose its supply and cause serious delays down the supply chain. Not wanting to create such disruptions and lose goodwill with P's customer base, P acquiesces to price increase. However, when it comes time for payment, P doesn't pay for entirety of the castings, but rather makes a payment equal to all of the castings at the original price. P seeks declaratory judgement that it isn't required to pay increased price. While **UCC Article 2 holds that modification needs no consideration to be binding, the presence of certain circumstances serve as an exception which includes bad faith (which can extend to economic duress)**. D's attempt to coerce a promise was both wrongful (threaten to breach with no attempt to negotiate) and left P with no reasonable alternative (no other source of castings, would create significant disruption and loss of goodwill with customers), two required elements of economic duress. Finally, there must be some showing of protest to the price increase and that the agreement was not freely entered into, which P clearly did. Thus, court rules that the modified price is not enforceable.
