# Mutual Assent

## Intention to be Bound: Objective Theory of Contract

* Old Subjective Theory of Assent
  * Meeting of the Minds: actual intention of a party, rather than their words or conduct, determines its legal obligations
* Objective Theory
  * One is either bound or not bound, not by one's secret intent, but by the reasonable interpretation of their words and actions
  * Holmes: The terms of a contract will be determined by what a normal speaker of English, under the same circumstances, would think the terms meant
  * This avoids two problems w/ the subjective approach: (1) adversarial approach used to subvert purpose of contract and (2) unreliability of subjective intent
  * Promisor's intent to not be bound is not entirely insignificant, but for the most part, law looks for a sufficient expression of apparent commitment to perform
  * As long as offeror could reasonably conclude that offeree knew of offer + accepted, doesn’t matter if offeree was subjectively unaware of the offer
  * R2d § 20 offers modified objective approach - we ordinarily look at the objective meaning unless one party knows/has reason to know

### Rules - Manifestation of Assent

* **R2d § 20: Effect of Misunderstanding**
  * No manifestation of mutual assent (and thus no contract) if parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and
    * There are two reasonable meanings and neither knows or has reason to know what other meant (mutual mistake) ; OR
    * Each party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other
  * You have manifestation of assent to the meaning attached by a party if:
    1. That party does not know or have reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other; AND
    1. The other knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the first
* **R2d § 21: Intention to be Legally Bound**
  * Don’t need to intend (actually/apparently) to be legally bound in order to form a contract. However, if one manifests an intent that a promise is not legally binding, it may prevent formation of contract

### *Ray v. William G. Eurice & Bros.*

Owners (P) entered a contract with builders (D) for the construction of a home. Builders submit 3 page building specifications. Plaintiff informs builder that he will have lawyer draw up separate contract. The new contract references a separate 5 page specification document that is dated the same as the 3 page specs. Builders sign the contract and subsequently refuse to perform after realizing the specs referenced in the contract were not the ones they submitted.Circuit court entered judgement in favor of the D on grounds that there was no "meeting of the minds" between parties, citing differences in intended meaning of an integral term. **Absent fraud, duress or mutual mistake, one having the capacity to understand a written document who reads and signs it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature in law**. It is clear that there was no fraud or duress present in the formation of the contract. If there was a mistake, it was a unilateral one made by the defendants, as the plaintiff's intend meaning of the terms is the same as expressed in the contract. Hence, the court ruled the builders **cannot avoid performance of the contract due differences in the clearly expressed terms of the contract and those it subjectively intended to be bound to**.

## Offer and Acceptance - Bilateral Contracts

* *Offer*: A manifestation of willingness to enter an agreement under defined terms
* *Bilateral Contract*: Term of art referring to a contract formed by the mutual exchange of promises
* Two rules for interpreting contractual offer that appeared in the cases below:
  1. Interpretation of an offer or acceptance is not what the party making it intended to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of that party would have thought it to mean.
  1. What can be interpreted as a definite offer should not require additional communication or expression of assent on behalf of the offerer. This is what distinguishes and offer from an invitation to make an offer.
* Classic Principles of Offer and Acceptance
  1. Power of acceptance created by an offer is terminated by by the offeree's rejection, the offeror's revocation, or death/incapacitation - 2nd Restatement Sec. 36
  1. A "qualified" or "conditional" acceptance constitutes only a counteroffer (*proposing a substituted bargain*) and is the functional equivalent of a rejection of the original contract as it applies to power of acceptance - 2nd Restatement sec. 39 & 59
  1. Common law generally provides that an offer is freely revocable at any time prior to acceptance, terminating power of acceptance, so long as notice is provided to the offeree and there is no pre-existing promise to leave offer open. Promise not to revoke over fixed period of time -- an *option* -- must be supported by consideration

### Rules - Bilateral Contracts

* **R2d § 22 - Mode of Assent: Offer by One party and Acceptance by the Other**
  * A manifestation of mutual assent may be made even though neither offer nor acceptance can be identified and even though the moment of formation cannot be determined
* **R2d § 24 - Offer Defined**
  * An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it
    * Gives the offeree the power of acceptance
    * If offeree manifests her acceptance, a binding K has been formed
    * Offeree’s power of acceptance is lost if she rejects the offer, counteroffers, delays too long in accepting the offer, (time limit may be explicit or implicit), or if offeror revokes
* **R2d § 26 - Preliminary Negotiations**
  * A manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has made a further manifestation of assent
    * Exchanging communications about the type of things to which parties would be willing to agree (e.g. to do, to pay) does not constitute an offer
* **R2d § 36 - Terminating the Power of Acceptance**
  * An offeree’s power of acceptance may be terminated by
    * counter-offer or rejection (unless the offeror has manifested a contrary intention or an intention to take it under further advisement) by the offeree; OR
    * Lapse of time; OR
    * Revocation by the offeror; OR
    * Death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree
  * Additionally, the non-occurrence of any condition of acceptance under the terms of the offer terminates the offer
* **R2d § 38 – Rejection**
  * Offeree loses power of acceptance if he rejects it, unless offeror manifests intent otherwise (e.g. keeps offer open)
  * Manifestation of intent not to accept counts as a rejection unless there is also manifestation to take offer into further consideration
* **R2d § 39 - Counter-Offers**
  * Counter-offer is offer made by original offeree relating to same subject matter with proposed substituted bargaining different from the original
  * Counter-offeror terminates power of acceptance unless offeror has manifested a contrary intention or unless the counteroffer manifests a contrary intention of the offeree
* **R2d § 43 - Indirect Communication of Revocation**
  * An offeree’s power of acceptance is terminated when the offeror takes definite action inconsistent with an intention to enter into the proposed contract and the offeree acquires reliable information to that effect
    * Generally, a revocation by the offeror does not become effective until it is received by the offeree
* **R2d § 50 - Acceptance of Offer Defined: Acceptance by Performance; Acceptance by Promise**
  * Acceptance of an offer is a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer
  * Acceptance by performance requires that at least part of what the offer requests be performed or tendered and includes acceptance by a performance which operates as a return promise
* **R2d § 58 - Necessity of Acceptance Complying with Terms of Offer**
  * Acceptance must comply w/ requirements of the offer as to the promise to be made or performance to be rendered
    * Acceptance must be unambiguous + unqualified in order for a contract to be formed. Silence, with exception, rarely amounts to acceptance 
* **R2d § 59 - Purported Acceptance which Adds Qualifications**
  * A reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror’s assent to terms additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter-offer
* **R2d § 60 - Acceptance of Offer which States Place, Time, or Manner of Acceptance**
  * If an offer prescribes the place, time or manner of acceptance its terms in this respect must be complied with in order to create a contract. If an offer merely suggests a permitted place, time or manner of acceptance, another method of acceptance is not precluded
* **R2d § 63 - Time When Acceptance Takes Effect**
  * Unless the offer provides otherwise:
    * An acceptance made in a manner and by a medium invited by an offer is operative and completes the manifestation of mutual assent as soon as put out of the offeree’s possession, without regard to whether it ever reaches the offeror
    * However, an acceptance under an option contract is not operative until received by the offeror
      * A rejection made after an acceptance has been made does not undo an acceptance
* **R2d §69 - Acceptance by Silence or Exercise of Dominion**
  * Where an offeree fails to reply to an offer, his silence and inaction operate as an acceptance in the following cases only:
    * Where an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation
    * Where the offeror has stated or given the offeree reason to understand that assent may be manifested by silence or inaction, and the offeree in remaining silent and inactive intends to accept the offer
    * Where because of previous dealings or otherwise, it is reasonable that the offeree should notify the offeror if he does not intend to accept.
  * An offeree who acts inconsistent with the offeror’s ownership of offered property is bound by the offered terms unless they are manifestly unreasonable. But if the act is wrongful as against the offeror it is an acceptance only if he allows it

### *Lonergan v Scolnick*

Plaintiff alleges he agreed to purchase land from defendant after making inquiry via mail. Defendant responded with letter providing a "rock-bottom" price instructing the plaintiff to act fast, as a potential buyer is likely in the coming days. Plaintiff interpreted this as an offer to purchase land at the minimum price and opened an escrow. However, the defendant had already sold the land to a third party by the time the plaintiff received the letter and "accepted the offer".The Court held there was no contract formed between the parties because a definite offer was never made. **If from a promise, a manifestation or the circumstances at the time, the "offeree" knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend it as an expression of his fixed purpose until he has given a further expression of assent, then that person has not made an offer**. Court references another case within the jurisdiction in which similar communication between parties was deemed to be purely preliminary (i.e. negotiations). The plaintiff had reason to know that the communication was not intended as "an expression of fixed purpose to make a definite offer" which requires no further assent on behalf of the offeror. The letter sent by the plaintiff may be viewed as an invitation to make an offer, but not an offer in and of itself.

### *Izadi v. Machado Ford, Inc.*

A car dealership (D) ran a print advertisement for a trade-in promotion. The promotion allowed for a minimum trade-in allowance of $3000 with the purchase of a (emphasis on the "a") new Ford. However, this offer was qualified by a provision in small print that limited the application of the allowance to two specific models that were not mentioned anywhere else in the advertisement. The plaintiff interpreted the offer as applicable to any model Ford and brought and action for breach of contract and fraud when the dealer wouldn't recognize this interpretation. The Court found that an objective interpretation of the advertisement, as **it would be perceived by a reasonable person, would be the same as the plaintiff's: an unqualified offer** for a $3000 trade-in allowance with the purchase of \*\*any\*\* new Ford. This runs contrary to the traditional rule that advertisements are merely invitations for offers unless they "invite acceptance without further negotiation in clear, definite, express, and unconditional language. Additionally, the Court found that the advertisement deliberately sought to make the public believe that an offer similar to the plaintiff's interpretation exists. It appealed to reasoning in which **courts have an interest, on public policy grounds, on upholding offers that sellers had intended to be deceptive**.

### *Normile v. Miller*

Plaintiffs make an offer on a home with a time-for-acceptance provision. The realtor, with whom the defendant has listed the property for sale, modifies several terms of the offer and returns it. The plaintiffs do not immediately accept the new terms and the property is eventually sold to another party. When the plaintiffs are informed that the property was sold, they promptly accept the new terms and make a deposit. Plaintiff's seek specific performance on the grounds that they accepted a valid offer. The Court held the realtor never expressed any assent to the original terms of the contract and the "conditional acceptance" and modification effectively serve as a rejection of the original offer and a counter-proposal. The counteroffer did not include the time-for-acceptance provision of the original offer, so there was no promise made to the plaintiffs to hold the offer open for a period of time. The defendant reserved the right to revoke the offer so long as it provides notice to the offeree, which it did. **An offer is freely revocable at any time before it has been accepted by the offeree, which terminates the offer (so longs as offeree is notified either directly or indirectly) and strips offeree of their power to revive the offer by any subsequent attempts to accept.** Thus, there was no valid offer for the plaintiffs to accept and no contract between the parties was ever formed.

## Offer and Acceptance - Unilateral Contracts

* A unilateral offer generally includes an implied *subsidiary promise* not to revoke in exchange for initiation of the invited performance so long as offeree's performance is timely. In beginning to render performance, offeree is providing both manifestation of assent and consideration for this option contract
  * Part performance or tender furnishing consideration in exchange for the subsidiary promise is the basis for the *substantial performance doctrine*
  * In these option contracts, the offeree is not bound to complete the performance
* Historical Development
  * Traditional unilateral contract theory was very liberal with regards to offeror's freedom to revoke at any time. Modern approach attempted to ameliorate this
  * Llewellyn criticizes modern approach dichotomy of bilateral vs unilateral, arguing there are very few instances in which true unilateral contracts are formed. These are where there is skepticism about a party's ability to perform and hence offeror has no interest in promissory acceptance (i.e. show, don't tell)
* A unilateral contract can be viewed as a way for offerors to insulate themselves from the risk of non-performance. However, to remedy this potential imbalance, the court has adopted certain ways of protecting offerees whom must first render performance in order for the offeror to be bound to its promise
  * May also provide benefit offeree in situations where he is unsure about his ability to perform, as it allows him to attempt performance without binding him to  full completion
* Some modern courts tend to disfavor unilateral contracts
  * Bilateral preferable because it establishes immediate rights
  * Will only treat as unilateral if expressly clear that promissory acceptance is inadequate and performance is necessary to accept

### Rules - Unilateral Contracts

* **R2d  §32 - Invitation of Promise or Performance**
* In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by performing, as the offeree chooses
  * When it was clear that the offeror sought an act and only an act in exchange, a promissory acceptance by offeree is insufficient
  * If the offeree simply began performance w/out making a return promise, the offeror would remain free to revoke until the offeree’s completion of performance
* **R2d § 45 - Option Contract Created by Part Performance or Tender**
  * Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, an option contract is created when the offeree begins performing
    * Only applies when it is unambiguous that it is a unilateral contract by which the offeror intends acceptance to be by performance
    * In many cases, especially where performance being invited would take time, beginning performance caries with it an implied promise for offeree to complete performance (i.e. no option contract, but a mutually binding one)
  * The offeror’s duty of performance under any option contract so created is conditional on completion or tender of the invited performance in accordance with the terms of the offer

### *Cook v. Coldwell Banker*

Real Estate firm (D) orally announced incentive program awarding end-of-year bonuses to agents that surpassed various sales milestones. Towards the end of the year, the defendant announced a modification to the program in which bonuses would not be paid until the following spring. Plaintiff, whom qualified for highest bonus percentage on the commission-based scale, had planned to stay with firm throughout the entire year so as to receive the bonus. The plaintiff departed from the firm after the end of the bonus cycle but prior to the awarding of bonuses. The defendant refused to pay out the bonus, resulting in the plaintiff bringing an action for breach of contract. Trial court awarded judgement in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant appealed on the grounds that the plaintiff neither provided sufficient consideration nor an acceptance to the bonus offer and that it was free to revoke. The court determined that the defendant's offer constituted a unilateral contract offer in which it would pay a bonus in exchange for continued at-will employment. The plaintiff's continued employment, which was induced by the promise of a bonus, serves as both consideration and acceptance in this unilateral contract. The court cited a general rule of contract law which states **unilateral offers may not be revoked when *substantial performance* necessary to accept the offer has been rendered**. The court found the plaintiffs continued employment, induced by the promise of a bonus, constituted substantial performance. In this light, the defendant had no right to revoke the offer and its failure to render performance of its promise is a breach of contract.

### *Sateriale v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.*

Tobacco company (D) operates customer loyalty program which issues certificates with the purchase of its products which can be saved and redeemed for merchandise. This program is frequently advertised and runs for nearly two decades before the defendant abruptly announces its retirement. All customers enrolled in the program are notified 6 months before the planned deprecation date. However, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants stopped acknowledging the program immediately after the notice was provided. The plaintiff's, stuck with thousands of the rewards certificates that they have unsuccessfully attempted to redeem, file a class action complaint for breach of contract. The court does not accept the tobacco company's defense that no valid offer existed since the advertisements are typically interpreted in the eyes of the law as merely invitations to make offers. The court states the rule for **an advertisement constituting a valid offer requires that the advertiser promise, in clear terms, to render performance in exchange for something requested and the recipient of the advertisement would reasonably conclude that rendering the requested performance would result in a contract**. The plaintiffs allege that the promise of the defendant in the unilateral contract was to make certain merchandise redeemable throughout the program's lifespan, which the court determines was a promise the defendant clearly breached by not redeeming certificates in the programs final six months.

## Definiteness and Postponed Bargaining

* Incomplete Bargaining 2 different situations:
  1. Agreement to agree - parties have reached agreement on a number of things but left for future agreement one or more terms (*Walker*)
  1. Formal contract contemplated - parties have reached agreement on at least the major provisions of the agreement but they contemplate the execution of a formal written K (*Quake Construction*)

* Reasons for leaving terms open
  1. Parties don't realize they hold different understandings about unaddressed terms
  2. Costs of continued bargaining might not be justified
  3. A party believes that a dispute over unaddressed terms would result in their favor, either as a matter of law or due to bargaining leverage
  4. Parties may have agreed to designate certain terms for postponement
     * *Ambiguity promotes agreement* - If a dispute over a term would prevent an agreement, postponing these terms may lead to a contract that wouldn't have otherwise been formed
  5. Another form of incomplete bargaining is the "formal contract contemplated" in which parties have reached agreement on essential terms, but contemplate the later execution of a formal written contract
     * Both UCC and R2d acknowledge an agreement in principle may be enforceable even if further negotiation on certain terms or execution of a formal written contract is contemplated, though they each treat these differently
     * Another perspective holds that in executing a letter of intent, parties are binding themselves to negotiate in good faith
* When is a K sufficiently definite to be enforceable vs. when is it just an agreement to agree? 2 Threshold Questions:
  1. Evidence surrounding intent to enter an agreement: was there a clear manifestation of mutual assent?
  1. Granting that there is evidence of an intent to enter an agreement, were the terms sufficiently indefinite that we wouldn’t want to enforce the agreement?

### Rules - Definiteness

* **R2d § 27 - Existence of Contract Where Written Memorial is Contemplated**
  * Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are preliminary negotiations (thus not a contract)
    * This will be a fact-specific, evidentiary determination based on business norms, other communications, etc.
    * Parties can specifically provide that negotiations are not binding until a formal agreement is executed
* **R2d § 33 - Certainty**
  * An offer can’t be accepted unless the material terms of the contract are reasonably certain
  * Reasonably certain defined as providing a basis for determining the existence of a breach/giving a remedy
  * Fact that one or more terms are left open or uncertain may show that manifestation of intent is not intended to be understood as an offer or acceptance

### *Walker v. Keith*

Defendant agrees to leases plot of land to plaintiff for ten years at a fixed monthly price and with an option for the lessee to extend the lease for another ten years. The renewal option did not define a fixed monthly price, but stated that a price would be agreed upon at the time of renewal based on present business conditions and value of the rental property. After the original ten year lease expires, the two parties fail to agree upon a new rental price for the extension. In declaratory judgement proceeding to determine whether plaintiff exercised the option, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants appealed on the grounds that the terms of the extension lacked the sufficient certainty to be enforceable. The court maintained that **in order to be binding, an agreement must be sufficiently definite for a court to ascertain its exact meaning, and that leaving terms open for future determination without identifying a method for this determination would render an agreement unenforceable**. An agreement to agree is not an enforceable contract, hence no legal obligation exists until an agreement is actually reached. In the case at hand, fixed rent is clearly a material term which has not been defined, nor has been defined a method for ascertaining it. The court concludes that the lessee's option was thus illusory, not enforceable, and it is not the role of the courts to force an agreement where none such exists.

### *Quake Construction v. American Airlines*

Jones Corp. awards construction contract to Quake (P) on behalf of American Airlines (D). Jones notifies Quake that they were awarded contract and requests the license numbers of the subcontractors that it plans to use. Quake responds that subcontractors won't provide license numbers unless a signed subcontract agreement was in place. To induce agreement between Quake and subcontractors, Jones sends a letter of intent laying outlining the details of the agreement to Quake and stating that a formal contract will be ready for signing soon. At the end of the letter, it states that Jones reserves the right to cancel the letter of intent if parties cannot agree on a fully executed subcontract agreement. Terms of the contract are discussed and modified orally in following days. Immediately after a meeting with government officials and subcontractors in which Jones designates Quake as the general contractor for the project, American Airlines informs Quake its involvement is being terminated. Quake sues for breach of contract, arguing letter of intent is enforceable. Fact that parties anticipate formal agreement doesn't render prior agreements as mere negotiations. **If parties intend for terms to be binding, the lack of a formal recitation of the terms is not defeating**. Hence, a letter of intent is enforceable if parties intend for it to be binding. Illinois Supreme Court disagrees with trial court's finding that cancellation clause was an agreement not to be bound until a formal written agreement was entered. Instead, intent in the letter was ambiguous since there is no need for cancellation if parties hadn't intended the letter to have a binding effect. In light of this ambiguity, the court finds the case was improperly dismissed for failure to state a claim.
