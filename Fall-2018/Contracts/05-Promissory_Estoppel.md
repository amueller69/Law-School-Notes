# Promissory Estoppel

## Promissory Estoppel in General

* Promissory Estoppel
  * Unbargained-for reliance as a substitute for consideration in contractual enforcement

### Rules

* **R2d § 90 - Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance**
  * Promissory estoppel will be found when:
    1. The promisor reasonably expects his action or promise will induce action
    2. Promisee acts in reliance on this promise
    3. Injustice may only be avoided through enforcement
  * Remedy will be limited by what justice requires (see reliance damages)
  * Does not explicitly use “detrimental reliance” language, but the phrase is often used to refer to that section’s requirement that the promise induce “action or forbearance” by the promise
* General rule in land transfers: when the donee has made substantial improvements to the land in reliance upon the promise to convey the land, courts will enforce the promise even if no consideration

## Promissory Estoppel in Charitable and Family Contexts

* Tend to be gratuitous, not part of bargained-for-exchange
  * Most promises in the family context are actuated by feelings of affection and altruism rather than by the expectation of quid pro quo.
  * The extent to which the law imposes legal obligations between persons in the family context is, for the most part, based on the relationship of the parties
* Promissory estoppel provides court with a tool to reach equitable resolutions to intra-family disputes
  * Makes enforceable what would otherwise be an unenforceable promise, when there has been reliance on that promise
* Charitable Subscriptions
  * R2d §90(2) states no consideration or reliance necessary for charitable promise to be enforceable
    * Court's have been extremely reluctant to apply this
    * *King* Court - needs to be promise with donative intent and then reliance on that promise

### Harvey v. Dow

 D, parents of P, own land and promise to give land to son and daughter at some point in the future, thought there is a great amount of indefiniteness in the promise. D helps P build house on the land, including doing the construction, obtaining permits, and securing line of credit to finance it all. However, P ultimately has falling out with family. D refuses to give her the deed to land which P needs for a mortgage. The promise relied upon need not be express, but can be inferred from the other party's conduct. In this case, P's encouragement and assistance with both the construction of and improvements made to the home appear to be such **conduct that implies a promise** and that D should **reasonably expect to cause reliance** by P.

### *King v. Trustees of Boston University*

MLK Jr made decision to deposit manuscripts and other materials with the Trustees of Boston University (BU) (D). He sent letter stating “I intend each year to indicate a portion of the materials deposited with [BU] to become the absolute property of [BU] as an outright gift from me, until all shall have been thus given to [BU]. In the event of my death, all such materials deposited with [BU] shall become from that date the absolute property of [BU].” When the materials were deposited, BU indexed the papers, made them available to researchers, and hired trained staff to take care of the papers and assist researchers (in reliance on promise). Upon MLK's death, his wife (P), sought the return of the materials to his estate. P filed suit and TC determined that MLK made an enforceable, charitable pledge to D. P appealed, arguing there was no indication of bargained-for-exchange that would have bound MLK to his promise. CoA defined charitable pledge as an "oral or written promise to do certain acts or give...property to a charity or for a charitable purpose". **In order to be enforceable, there must be promise to give property to a charitable institution and consideration or reliance on the promise.** CoA found MLK expressed intent in his letter to transfer property in installments and then absolutely upon his death, which might reasonably be construed as a promise to make a charitable pledge. Additionally, the indexing of the papers and other activities by D went beyond that obligated of a simple bailee, evidence of D's reliance to eventually take full ownership of the property. Thus, TC judgement affirmed.

## Promissory Estoppel in Commercial Contexts

* UCC
  * Promissory estoppel is not recognized as a defense to non-enforcement under the UCC
* How do PE cases fare under traditional bargain contract theory
  * *Katz*
    * P incurred no legal detriment, as he had no right to continue his employment
  * *Aceves* - hard to see an acceptance
    * PE is a more natural fit than a typical K
    * Very indefinite terms - what constitutes “working with someone”?
* Option Contracts
  * An option contract can be made binding and irrevocable by subsequent action in reliance upon it it even though such action is neither requested nor given in exchange for the option promise
  * When an option is conditioned upon a performance of certain acts, the performance of certain acts, the performance of the acts may constitute a consideration may constitute a consideration to uphold a contract for option. However, there is no such condition imposed if the acts wer not intended to benefit nor were they incurred on behalf of the option
    * Distinction from unilateral contract is fuzzy?
* Unilateral Contracts
  * Offer inviting performance (and not promissory acceptance) caries implied promise not to revoke once performance begins. The start of performance serves as consideration which makes subsidiary promise binding
  * Merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may, in some cases, serve as sufficient reason for making the subsidiary promise binding (see §90)
  * Reasonable reliance resulting in a forseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis for implying the subsidiary promise not to revoke

### Rules

* **R2d § 87 - Option Contract**
  * An offer is binding as an option contract if it:
    * Is in writing and signed by the offeror, recites a purported consideration for the offer, and proposes an exchange on fair terms within a reasonable time; OR
    * Is made irrevocable by statute
  * An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice
* **R2d § 45 – Option Contract Created by Part Performance**
  * If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response there to, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered with the time stated in the offer
  * Comment b - Main offer includes an necessarily implied subsidiary promise that if part of performance is given (i.e. consideration), offeror will not revoke offer and acceptance will occur when performance is complete.
* **UCC §2-205 Firm Offers**
  * An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror
    * Gives assurance that it will be held open, even where offer not supported by consideration
* **UCC 2-104: Merchant + Between Merchants**
  * “Merchant” means someone who deals in goods, even if employ someone else to do the dealing

### *Katz v. Danny Dare, Inc.*

D offers P to pay an annuity in exchange for his early retirement. P acquiesces and eventually starts working part-time at another business. D ceases payments and is sued. Trial court rules in favor of D, reasoning agreement wasn't enforceable because P didn't have to do anything/give up any legal right and the alternative was termination of his employment. Upon appeal, CoA reviews case. While not a contract because Katz incurred no legal detriment, as he had no unconditional right to remain employed, it could nonetheless be enforceable under theory of promissory estoppel. Court holds that **in order for the doctrine of promissory estoppel to apply, there must be:**

1. **A promise**
2. **Detrimental reliance on that promise**
3. **Only way to avoid injustice is to enforce the promise**

CoA finds that there was clear and definite promise. It also determined that P voluntarily gave up earnings to his own detriment in exchange for the promise. It can't be said that termination was P's only alternative, as it was clear D was taking every measure to avoid doing so. Finally, court held corrective justice was necessary as there is no other way for P to recover lost earnings in reliance on D's promise. Hence, the court reverses trial court's decision.

### *Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A.*

P defaults on mortgage and files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. D, who purchased mortgage, promises to work with P on reinstatement/loan modification if P files for less protective Chapter 13 bankruptcy. D forecloses and doesn't attempt to co-operate until after the home was auctioned. P brings action seeking relief for promissory estoppel, among other claims. Court identifies requirements for promissory estoppel claim in CA as:

1. **A promise on clear and unambiguous terms**
2. **Reliance by promisee**
3. **Expectation of reliance must be reasonable and forseeable by promisor**
4. **Promisee was injured by reliance**

The court determined that D's promise was unambiguous: it wouldn't foreclose without first engaging it negotiations. Additionally, the court held that D should have foreseen P's reliance on the promise because it was offered for the sole purpose of inducing P to file Chapter 13, which it did. Finally, P's reliance on the promise resulted in several rights and protections under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be surrendered and this ultimately allowed D to foreclose. Thus, the court determined P stated a claim for promissory estoppel.

### *Berryman v. Kmoch*

P and D enter agreement for option contract for the purchase of land. D has right to exercise option within 120 days in exchange for providing $10 or "other valuable consideration". D never actually makes the payment and P requests a release from the option days later. P sells the land to another party and D attempts to exercise the option. P seeks declaratory judgement that option is null and void. Court holds that option contracts require consideration in order to be binding; **an "option contract" without consideration (or reliance that can satisfy promissory estoppel) is no more than a mere offer to sell**. Court rejects the promissory estoppel defense as P could not have reasonably relied on the option while knowingly failing to pay $10. Thus, in the absence of consideration, there is nothing here more than an offer to sell the land. Thus, D's receipt of reliable information that the land had been sold served as an effective revocation of the offer
