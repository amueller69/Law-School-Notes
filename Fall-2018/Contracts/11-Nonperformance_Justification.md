# Justifications for Nonperformance

## Changed Circumstances: Impossibility, Impracticability, and Frustration

* Contract liability is strict liability. The obligor is therefore liable in damages for breach even if he is without fault and even if circumstances have made K more burdensome or less desirable than he had anticipated
* However, court may still grant relief in extraordinary circumstances which make performance so vitally different from what was reasonable to be expected as to alter the essential nature of that performance. In such cases, court must determine whether justice requires departure from general rule that obligor bears the risk.
* Three distinct grounds for discharging: (1) circumstance has made own performance impracticable; (2) circumstances have so destroyed value of other party's performance as to frustrate his own purpose in making the contract; (3) obligor won't receive performance in exchange due to obligee asserting impracticability or frustration
  * Impossibility – cannot be performed
  * Impracticability – drastic change in circumstances make it unreasonable to perform
  * Frustration of Purpose – principle purpose of contract defeated by unanticipated change circumstances
* Justifications
  * Contracts are silent on the basic assumptions that may radically change, so these doctrines try to help re-create what the parties might have wanted
  * There is an efficiency interest in having default rules for parties to contract w/, b/c there is less for parties to negotiate over

### Rules - Impossibility, Impracticability, and Frustration

* **R2d § 261** – Impracticable where change in a basic assumption of contract without fault. In such circumstances, duty is discharged
  * Generally either due to "acts of God" or acts of third parties (e.g. government)
* **R2d § 262** – Death or incapacity of person necessary for performance impracticable if effects basic assumption of contract
* **R2d § 263** – Destruction/deterioration of thing necessary for performance impracticable if non-occurrence was basic assumption
* **R2d § 264** – Duty made impracticable by need to comply with government regulation, if non-occurrence was basic assumption
* **R2d § 265** - Where after a contract is made and a party's principle purpose for making it is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an even, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which K is made, then remaining duties to perform are discharged unless language or circumstances indicate otherwise
* **UCC § 2-615 – Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions**
  1. Delay in delivery or non-delivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies w/ (b) + (c) is not a breach if performance has been made impracticable by something happening + basic assumption of K was that such a think wouldn’t happen OR by good faith compliance w/ govt regulations or orders whether/not later prove to be invalid
  1. When things in (a) only affect a part of the seller’s capacity to perform, he must allocate production + deliveries among his customers but may include regular customers not then under K as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. May allocate in an fair and reasonable manner.
  1. Seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be a delay or non-delivery and when allocation is required under (b), of the estimated quota then available for buyer.
  * Comments:
    * Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen thing which alters the essential nature of the performance. Rise or collapse in the market is not itself a justification. However, severe shortage of raw materials due to war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply, which cause a marked increase in cost or altogether prevent the seller from securing the supplies necessary to his performance are all justified circumstances.
    * Government interference cannot excuse unless it truly supervenes in a way as to be beyond the seller’s assumption of risk; same goes if party claiming excuse causes or colludes in inducing the government action
    * Seller must fulfill the K to the extent the supervening contingency permits + must take account of all customers

### *Waddy v. Riggleman*

P entered into a contract to purchase a tract of land from D for $22,500, with closing to occur on or before a certain date over two months later. The agreement required the D to convey title to the land free and clear of all liens and defects. D's attorney prepared contract and was charged with obtaining the relevant mortgage releases, which he failed to do in timely manner. Ds backed out of the agreement and P files suit against D and two banks that had liens on property. D subsequently sells property, adversely affected the 48 acres sought by P, to a third party (D2).TC dismisses complaint, holding that that the transfer of the land was impossible and that time was of the essence in closing on the sale. P appealed. CoA reviewed the impracticability of the sale and concluded that the elements needed to assert impracticability as a justification for non-performance were not satisfied by P. For performance to be impracticable, **must show more than mere increase in difficulty and reasonable efforts to overcome obstacles to performance**. Likewise, **supervening event making performance impracticable must be without fault by D**. D's failure to obtain mortgage releases, for which they had 2+ months to complete, does not give rise to impracticability. A **party can't by its own act place itself in a position to be unable to perform and then subsequently plead that inability as an excuse for nonperformance.** Hence, CoA rules TC erred in dismissing complaint.

### *Mel Frank Tool & Supply, Inc. v. Di-Chem Co.*

P leases warehouse space for D to store chemicals, though nature of chemicals unknown to P at the time. Term included in the agreement provides that D make no unlawful use of the warehouse space. At some point during lease, the city changed the fire code to prohibit hazmat storage and D fails inspection. While building could be brought up to could, P and D fail to reach agreement about sharing costs to do so. D notifies P of intention to vacate since it can't legally store chemicals. P brings suit for breach and D asserts affirmative defense of failure, fraud in the inducement, and impossibility. TC found for P and D appealed. Court holds that the facts of the dispute fall within the parameters of **"frustration of purpose": where the principal purpose of the contract is substantially frustrated to the extent where it is not fairly to be regarded as within the risks assumed and the non-occurrence of the frustrating event was a basic assumption of the contract. In cases where a subsequent government regulation prohibits tenant from legally using premise for its original intended purpose, then the tenant's purpose is substantially frustrated and is thereby relieved from further obligation to pay rent, unless there is a serviceable use for property consistent with a provision of the lease.** However, D failed to provide any evidence that all of the chemicals stored on the property were hazardous, hence there is still some serviceable use and the D's purpose isn't entirely frustrated (the **fact that property isn't as useful as originally intended isn't sufficient to establish frustration**). Thus, court affirms ruling that D breached.

## Modification

* Consideration for contract modification
  * UCC and CISG generally do not require more consideration for modification
  * R2d will require consideration for modification of contractual duties
* Pre-existing duty rule
  * Merely promising to perform an existing obligation will not serve as valid consideration for additional return compensation from the other party
  * Today, courts accept even a small/modest addition/alteration of performance as enough to satisfy rule

### Rules - Modification

* **R2d § 73 - Performance of a Legal Duty**
  * Cannot modify w/out consideration. Performing a legal duty already owed to a promisor, where there is no honest dispute about what the original bargain intended, is NOT consideration. But a similar performance is consideration if it is different from what was required by the duty in a way that reflects more than a pretense of bargain
* **R2d § 89 – Modification of Executory Contract**
  * Promise modifying duty under K is binding if:
    1. If it is a fair and equitable modification in view of the difference in circumstances anticipated and actual (e.g. forces of nature that complicate performance); OR
    1. If it is allowed by statute; OR
    1. To the extent that justice requires enforcement where party materially + justifiably changed his position in reliance on the promise (neglected in *AK Packers*)
* **UCC § 2-209 – Modification, Rescission, and Waiver**
  1. Modification does not need new consideration except where special circumstances (good faith still applies; reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade; modification without legit commercial reason and extortion are barred)
  1. Agreements that exclude modification unless in writing cannot be rescinded or changed unless mutually consented to in writing
  1. Must satisfy Statute of Frauds
  1. May operate as waiver if does not modify correctly
  1. May retract waiver unless there has been detrimental reliance or lack of notice of retraction
* **CISG Art. 29**
  1. Contract may be termed or modified by agreement, no need for additional consideration
  1. However, may not waive the written requirement unless there is detrimental reliance on it

### *Alaska Packers v. Domenico*

Contract for services whereby P's man a fishing vessel from San Francisco to AK and work fishing season. Contract paid base salary plus piece rate on fish caught. In middle of performance, Ps stopped work and demanded compensation be doubled. D acquiesces and work resumes. At end of season, D only compensates P according to the original contractual terms. P argues both suspended performance and demands were justified because D deliberately equipped ship with bad nets to prevent paying for excess fish that would be written of as spoilage due to limited production capacity. Question for CoA was whether or not the modified terms of the contract were supported by sufficient consideration. CoA holds that D consented to demands without consideration, as it was based upon agreement for P to render exact same services that it was already contractually obligated to perform. **Where parties enter a new agreement under which one party agrees to do no more than he was already obligated to do under an existing contract, the new agreement is unenforceable for lack of consideration.** Additionally, this can't construed as a voluntary waiver of breach of the original contract and agreement to a new one because it was coerced by the non-performing party. Thus, CoA rules there are no grounds for legally enforcing modified terms of the contract and the original terms, which D satisfied, control the contract.

### *Kelsey-Hayes Co. v. Galtaco Casting*

P has 3 year agreement with D for castings used in auto parts. D facing financial trouble and informs P of 30% increase in the castings that is necessary to keep operating. If P does not consent, it will lose its supply and cause serious delays down the supply chain. Not wanting to create such disruptions and lose goodwill with P's customer base, P acquiesces to price increase. However, when it comes time for payment, P doesn't pay for entirety of the castings, but rather makes a payment equal to all of the castings at the original price. P seeks declaratory judgement that it isn't required to pay increased price. While **UCC Article 2 holds that modification needs no consideration to be binding, the presence of certain circumstances serve as an exception which includes bad faith (which can extend to economic duress)**. D's attempt to coerce a promise was both wrongful (threaten to breach with no attempt to negotiate) and left P with no reasonable alternative (no other source of castings, would create significant disruption and loss of goodwill with customers), two required elements of economic duress. Finally, there must be some showing of protest to the price increase and that the agreement was not freely entered into, which P clearly did. Thus, court rules that the modified price is not enforceable.
