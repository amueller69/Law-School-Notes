# The meaning of the Agreement

## Interpretation

* Interpretation
  * Refers to the process by which a court gives meaning to contractual language when the parties attach materially different meanings to that language
  * Modern definition collapses, into a single term, both the process of determining the meaning parties attributed to contractual language and judicial role in determining the legal effect of the language
  * Problems in this area are focused on what the purpose of the contract is, what the subjective intents of the parties are, and what evidence to use in interpreting the contract
* Historical Approach (Subjective)
  * Where parties attribute materially different meanings to language, contract was not formed because formation required a meeting of the minds
  * Holmes argues for an external approach to interpretation because subjective one was to difficult to enforce and external method is fair because a speaker should always expect words to be understood in accordance with normal usage
* Objective Approach
  * Williston - Words and conduct should be interpreted in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person familiar with the circumstances rather than in accordance with the subjective intention of either party
  * Modern law has departed from the extreme objectivist approach - possible to interpret a contract in a way in which neither party intended nor desired
* Modern Contract Law Approach
  * Corbin layed foundation: In interpreting K, court should answer two questions:
    1. Whose meaning controls the interpretation of the contract
    1. What was that party's meaning
  * This would prevent court from imposing meaning that differed from what both parties understood
  * R2d § 201 adopts this approach
  * Even after applying array of interpretation tools, may be appropriate for court so conclude that the parties did not intend to make an enforceable agreement
    * However, where it is clear that parties intended to be bound or where there has already been a good deal of performance, rescission may be inappropriate

### Rules

* R2d
  * §201 - Whose Meaning Prevails
    1. Where the parties have attached the same meaning to a promise/agreement/term; it is interpreted according to that meaning.
    1. Where the parties have attached different meanings to a promise/agreement/term, it is interpreted according to the meaning attached by one of them if at the time the agreement was made:
       * That party did not know/have reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other
       * The other knew/had reason to know meaning attached by the first party
    1. If neither party knew/had reason to know the other’s different meaning, there is no contract due to lack of mutual assent
  * § 202 – Rules in Aid of Interpretation
    1. Words and other conduct interpreted in light of circumstances; principle purpose of the parties (if ascertainable) given great weight
    1. Interpret the contract as a whole, including supplements
    1. Language is interpreted in accordance with generally prevailing meaning, or in accordance with usage in respective technical field if technical/term of art, unless otherwise stated
    1. Use, with great weight, course of performance to understand nature of contract where agreement involves repeated occasion for performance or objection by knowledgeable party
    1. Interpret intent as consistent w/ course of performance, dealing, and trade usage wherever reasonable
  * § 203 - Standards of Preference in Interpretation
    * In interpreting agreement, following standards of preference are generally applicable:
      * An interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect
      * Hierarchy of weight: express terms \> course of performance \> course of dealing \> trade usage
      * Specific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general language
      * Separately negotiated or added terms are given greater weight than standardized terms or other terms not separately negotiated
  * § 204 - Supplying an Omitted Essential Term
    * When the parties have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to determining rights/obligations, term reasonable in light of circumstances is supplied by the court
  * § 206 - Interpretation Against the Draftsman
    * In choosing among the reasonable meanings, generally prefer the meaning that operates against the party who supplies the words/writing
      * The application of this varies by the circumstances and jurisdiction. Some don't see need where both parties are sophisticated. Others limit to cases where one party is solely responsible for language
  * § 207 - Interpretation Favoring the Public
    * In choosing among the reasonable meanings of a promise/agreement/term, generally prefer a meaning that serves the public interest
  * § 211 - Standardized Agreements
    1. Where party signs/manifests assent to a writing and has reason to believe that like writings are regularly used to embody terms of agreements of the same type, he adopts the writing as an integrated agreement
    1. Term of standardized agreement, where reasonable, interpreted as treating alike all those similarly situated
    1. Where other party has reason to believe the other party manifesting such assent would not do so if they knew writing contained a particular term, the term is not part of the agreement
  * § 222 - Usage of Trade
    1. Usage of trade is a usage so regularly observed in place/field as to justify expectation that it will be observed with respect to a particular agreement
    1. Unless otherwise agreed, a trade usage in the field that parties are engaged in or a usage of which they know (or have reason to) gives meaning to their agreement
  * § 223 – Course of Dealing
    * Course of dealing is sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct. Gives meaning to agreement unless otherwise agreed.
* UCC § 1-303 – Course of Performance, Dealing, and Usage of Trade
  1. A course of performance is same as in R2d
  1. Course of dealing is same as in R2d
  1. A trade usage is same as in R2d
  1. Course of dealing, course of performance, and usage of trade are relevant to ascertaining particular meaning of terms and may supplement or qualify them
  1. Course of dealing, course of performance, and usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If they conflict: express terms \> course of performance \> course of dealing \> trade usage
  1. A course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance
  1. Evidence of a relevant trade usage offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party

### Canons of Interpretation: Standard Maxims

Use these to figure out the starting question of what is the meaning of an ambiguous express prior to proceeding down the hierarchy of weight:

1. Noscitur a sociis. The meaning of a word in a series is affected by others in the same series; or, a word may be affected by its immediate context. Look to the terms in a list to determine the meaning of an ambiguous term
1. Ejusdem generis. A general term joined w/ a specific one will be deemed to include only things that are like the specific one. (cattle, hogs, and other animals. Wouldn’t include house-dog but might include sheep being raised for market)
1. Expressio unius exclusio alterius. If one or more specific items are listed, w/out any more general or inclusive terms, other items, although similar in kind, are excluded. (“I’m selling my cattle and hogs.” Excludes sheep and house-dog; If regulating X, Y, Z  means you are not regulating D)
1. Ut magis valeat quam pereat. An interpretation that makes the contract valid is preferred to one that makes it invalid. (like canon of constitutional avoidance)
1. Omnia praesumuntur contra proferentem. I cut you pick. Interpretation Against the Draftsman if there are two reasonable meanings. (incentivizes parties to draft fairly. Employed very vigorously in a form K. Not employed vigorously where a K has gone back and forth a lot)
1. Interpret contract as a whole. Every term should be interpreted as part of the whole and not as if isolated from it. (“chicken” meant same thing each time term appeared in K)
1. Purpose of the parties. Principal/common purpose will govern. If purposes obscure, go to “plain meaning.”
1. Specific provision is exception to a general one. If two provisions of a K are inconsistent and if one is “general” enough to include the specific situation, the specific provision will be deemed to qualify the more general one (and to control in attributing meaning).
1. Handwritten or typed provisions control printed provisions
1. Public interest preferred. That interpretation which favors the public interest controls
   * Modern courts have held that usage of same term in statute/legislation is not completely determinative

### *Frigaliment Importing, Co. v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp.*

Dispute over the term chicken after D ships P chickens that didn't meet its expectations. P contends chicken means "broiler" (young, baking chicken) While D contends chicken is a general term which also encompasses fowl (old, stewing chicken). Court holds that P failed to meet burden of showing that the term was used in the narrow sense. It first recognizes ambiguity of the term and looks to the rest of the contract (other express terms) to aid in its interpretation. This doesn't resolve ambiguity. Nor are there any course of performance/dealings that can aid in interpretation. Court uses combination of trade usage and definition to ascertain an objective meaning. **A party is bound by the other's meaning if that party had reason to know the other party's meaning while the other had no reason to know of the different meaning ascribed by the first party**. Here, the objective meaning coincides with D's subjective understanding and it had no reason to believe that P's own understanding departed from the objective one.

### *C & J Fertilizer, Inc. v. Allied Mutual Insurance Co.*

P's plant burglarized. Insurance policy defined “burglary” as requiring visible damage to exterior of premises. Visible damage was to interior, though outside door could have been forced open without leaving visible marks. P contends it was obvious this was an outside job. Purpose of contract was to cover only external burglary, not internal employee theft. Court recognizes this is a case involving an insurance contract of adhesion, where the majority rule has held that the insured is not bound to know its contents. Here, whatever terms buried in such a contract do not eviscerate the reasonable meaning of such a term. **Where other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term, the term is not part of the agreement**. Such reason includes a bizarre/oppressive definition of a term or evisceration of a terms standard meaning. There was nothing that would lead P to reasonably expect "third party burglary" to require the appearance of visible marks on the exterior. Thus, the objectively reasonable expectation should be enforced and the policy should cover.

## Parol Evidence Rule

* Parol Evidence - Evidence, either written or oral, that is extrinsic to a written agreement
  * Under rules of evidence commonly employed in US courts, any evidence to be prima facie admissible into court must be "relevant" -- rationally probative of some fact material to the parties' dispute
* Parole Evidence Rule - Rule that such evidence will be excluded from the trier of fact. However, the rule has many exceptions and intricacies
  * When the parties have mutually agreed to incorporate (or “integrate”) a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party is allowed to contradict or supplement that written agreement w/ extrinsic evidence (written or oral) or prior agreements or negotiations between them
  * Not a rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive law
  * Does not define was is affirmatively admissible, but only operates to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible as rationally probative of some fact at issue
  * Rationale:
    * To avoid inconvenience and injustice that would result if extrinsic evidence were admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement
    * Enforces a clear ex ante approach to what is a contract
    * Makes court more efficient because there is less evidence to contemplate
* Complete Integration - When parties have mutually agreed to integrate a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party will be permitted to contradict or supplement terms with parol evidence
* Partial Integration - When a writing is intended to be final only with respect to a part of their agreement, the agreement may be supplemented by external evidence, but terms cannot be contradicted
  * Rather than find a contract to be partially integrated, Court more frequently treats it as complete but with ambiguity, allowing PE to be admitted
* The correct application of the parol evidence rule requires that the court first determine whether the writing in question is intended to be a final expression of the parties agreement. How is this determined?
  * Four Corners Rule - Question must be determined from the four quarters of the writing without resort to extrinsic evidence. A substantial number of jurisdictions till generally adhere to this approach
  * Others jurisdictions have adopted the contextual approach that is reflected in R2d - A writing cannot of itself prove its own completeness and wide latitude must be allowed for inquiry into circumstances bearing on the intention of the parties
    * Corbin - A finding of integration should always depend on the actual intent of the parties
* **Exceptions to Parol Evidence Rule**
  * Interpreting ambiguity - Parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of aiding the interpretation of ambiguity in a contract. While traditionally only applicable when contractual terms were ambiguous prima facie, modern courts are more likely to admit evidence that a party offers to demonstrate special meaning of terms that don't appear unclear on their face. Rather than determine whether an agreement is only partially integrated, courts are more likely to treat it as complete and then rely on the ambiguity exception.
  * Subsequent agreements - Rule does not apply to agreements made after the execution of the writing
  * Oral conditions precedent - Parol evidence rule not applicable to evidence purported to show that a written agreement's effectiveness was subject to an oral condition
  * Defenses to formation - Rule does not apply to evidence offered to show contract was invalid, such as due to fraud (both in the execution and inducement), duress, undue influence, incapacity, mistake, or illegality
  * Reformation - Rule does not bar evidence used to establish that part of the agreement was omitted due to mistake and, thus, a party is entitled to a remedy such as judicial reformation of the contract. Generally, one must show clear and convincing evidence that both parties intended to include the term in their written agreement
  * Collateral agreements - Traditionally, the exception only applied to agreements about a subject distinct from the transaction in the writing. However, modern courts more are more flexible and may justify admission of parol evidence even if related to the transaction in writing. Intersects with partial integration in instances where additional agreement is not furnished with separate consideration. UCC only excludes this evidence if the writing is clearly intended to be a complete and exhaustive statement of all terms
* Merger Clause - states that the writing is intended to be final and complete; all prior understandings have been “merged” into or superseded by the final writing. Purpose is to tell courts we intend this to be a fully integrated agreement
  * Some courts give full acknowledgement to these clauses and do not allow PE
  * Other courts do not, especially in a contract of adhesion or a situation where there is unequal bargaining

### Rules

* R2d
  * §210 - Completely and Partially Integrated Agreements
    1. A completely integrated agreement is an integrated agreement adopted by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
    1. A partially integrated agreement is an integrated agreement other than a completely integrated agreement
    1. Whether an agreement is completely or partially integrated is to be determined by the court as a question preliminary to determination of a question of interpretation or to application of the parol evidence rule
  * §214 - Evidence of Prior or Contemporaneous Agreements and Negotiations
    * Agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous w/ the adoption of a writing are admissible in evidence to establish
      * That the writing is or is not an integrated agreement
      * That the integrated agreement, if any, is completely or partially integrated
      * The meaning of the writing, whether or not integrated
      * Illegality, fraud, duress, mistake, lack of consideration, or other invalidating cause
      * Ground for granting or denying rescission, reformation, specific performance, or other remedy
  * §215 - Contradiction of Integrated Terms
    * Except as stated in the preceding Section, where there is a binding agreement, either completely or partially integrated, evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations is not admissible in evidence to contradict a term of the writing
  * §216 - Contradiction of Integrated Terms
    * Evidence of a consistent additional term is admissible to supplement an integrated agreement unless the court finds that the agreement was completely integrated'
    * An agreement is not completely integrated if the writing omits a consistent additional agreed term which is
      1. Agreed to for separate consideration, or
      1. Such a term as in the circumstances might naturally be omitted from the writing
  * §217 - Integrated Agreement Subject to Oral Requirement of a Condition
    * Where the parties to a written agreement agree orally that performance of the agreement is subject to the occurrence of a stated condition, the agreement is not integrated with respect to the oral condition
* UCC §2-202 - Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence
  * Terms w/ respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented
    * By course of dealing or trade usage or by course of performance
    * By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement

### Decision Tree

* Is there a writing?
  * If not, PE rule does not apply
* What is the level of integration (standard used to determine this varies by jurisdiction (4 corners v. contextual approach))?
  * If partially integrated, exclude PE of contradicting terms
  * If completely integrated, exclude both supplemental and contradicting terms
  * If neither, PE rule does not apply

### *Thompson v. Libby*

P and D have agreed on terms for sale of logs subject to a written agreement. P brings action claiming quality of logs breached warranty that, while not included in the writing, was agreed to orally. Lower court admits evidence. State supreme court holds that the writing, on its face, appears to be a complete expression of the entire agreement. Though recognizing even completely integrated agreements may require external evidence to help reach a better understanding of contractual language, **no ambiguity exists in the writing at issue and hence PE is to be excluded (four corners rule)**. Additionally, it rejects  application of the "collateral agreement" exception, as a quality warranty is a term of the sale and not a subject distinct from the writing. Thus, the court rules the lower court erred in admitting the parol evidence.

### *Taylor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile*

Insurance company (D) provides representation for P in suit arising out of car accident, though court enters judgement against P for an amount in excess of his policy limits. P sues D for bad faith in failing to settle matters within policy limits. D moves for summary judgement on grounds that P had signed release which waived any potential contractual claims against D. Trial court denies D's motion, holding the contractual language was ambiguous and parol evidence is needed. Jury awards judgement in favor of P, but CoA finds no ambiguity and that parol evidence was improperly admitted. State supreme court holds that it is important, when interpreting contract, that it attempt to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time of contractual formation. Thus, the court rejects rule that writing must be ambiguous on its face in order for PE to be admitted. **If a judge considers the offered external evidence and it supports conclusion that the contractual language is reasonably susceptible to differing interpretations, the evidence is admissible to help determine the intended meaning**. It ruled that external evidence supported P's contention that the contractual claims waived in the release didn't extend to bad faith claims and that there were multiple reasonable interpretations of the language. Hence, the court agreed with the trial court and vacated CoA's decision.
