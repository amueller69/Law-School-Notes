# Statute of Frauds

## The Statute of Frauds: General Principles

* The Statute of Frauds
  * Refers to any statute (or body of law) that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing in order to be enforceable
    * No one statute of frauds but a series of state statutes + state common law + UCC
  * Not an issue of contract formation, but one of contract enforcement
    * Need a K before SoF becomes applicable
    * Must still satisfy other formation requirements in addition to writing requirement
  * Contract governed by the SoF can be enforced against a party that signed, not one that didn’t. Both parties might have contracted parties but, if the SoF applies, K can only be enforced against the party that signed
  * Minimum requirements to satisfy the SoF:
    1. K must be signed by the party charged (i.e. party against which performance is sought)
    1. The essential terms must be listed
* Justifications
  * Statute of Frauds is supposed to ensure that courts only enforce true contracts (evidentiary function)
  * Prevents accidental/unintentional Ks from being made
  * Ensures people understand the gravity of what they’re obligating themselves to do (seriousness of undertaking reflected in the level of formality)
  * Reinforces social expectations requiring writing
  * Fraud prevention
* Consequences
  * Formation of contract that appears to be valid, with requirements mutual assent and consideration satisfied, may nonetheless be unenforceable due to SoF and lack of a writing
    * A party may thus still be defrauded
  * Risk of not enforcing oral contracts that both parties want enforced

## Statute of Frauds and Non-Goods

* Questions to be raised when SoF is asserted as defense against enforcement
  1. Is the contract at issue one of the types to which the SoF applies?
  1. Has the SoF been satisfied?
  1. Are there other factors in the case (i.e. reliance or tendered performance) which might invoke an exception?
* Part Performance Exception to SoF
  * Generally only applicable to land in the cases of non-goods
  * Unequivocally referable test criticized in restatement - should be based on actual reliance
* Promissory Estoppel Exception to SoF
  * In contracts that don’t involve the sale of land or goods, part performance may be important in determining whether a court should apply the promissory estoppel exception
  * Higher threshold than § 90
  * Some courts don't enforce this exception

### Rules

* **R2d § 110 - Statute of Frauds: Classes of Contracts Covered**
  * The following classes of contracts are subject to a statute, commonly called the Statute of Frauds, forbidding enforcement unless there is a written memorandum or an applicable exception
    * A contract of an executor or administrator to answer for a duty of his decedent (the executor-administrator provision);
    * A contract to answer for the duty of another (the suretyship provision—one party assumes liability for the debt of another)
    * A contract made upon consideration of marriage (the marriage provision)
    * A contract for the sale of an interest in land (the land contract provision)
    * A contract that is not to be performed (completed) w/in one year from the making thereof (the one-year provision)
* **R2d § 129 – Land: Action in Reliance**
  * A contract for the transfer of an interest in land may be specifically enforced notwithstanding failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds if it is established that the party seeking enforcement, in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided only by specific enforcement
* **R2d §131 - General Requisites of a Memorandum**
  * Unless additional requirements are prescribed by the particular statute, a contract within the SoF is enforceable if it is evidenced by any writing, signed by or on behalf of the party to be charged, which
    * Reasonably identifies the subject matter of the contract
    * Is sufficient to indicate that a contract with respect thereto has been made between the parties or offered by the signer to the other party, and
    * States with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the unperformed promises in the contract
* **R2d §132 - Several Writings**
  * The memorandum may consist of several writings if one of the writings is signed and the writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction
* **R2d §133 -Memorandum Not Made as Such**
  * Except in the case of a writing evidencing a contract upon consideration of marriage, the Statute may be satisfied by a signed writing not made as a memorandum of a contract (e.g. informal letter, meeting minutes, etc)
* **R2d §134 - Signature**
  * The signature to a memorandum may be any symbol made or adopted with an intention, actual or apparent, to authenticate the writing as that of the signer
    * Courts generally have low bar for determining what constitutes a signature: use of letterhead, initials, today the typed out names at the bottom of an employment agreement, electronic signatures
* **R2d §139 - Consequences of Non-Compliance: Enforcement by Virtue of Action in Reliance**
  * A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action by the promisee and does so in fact is enforceable, notwithstanding the Statute of Frauds, if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise
  * Following circumstances significant in determining whether injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise
  1. availability + adequacy of other remedies, particularly cancellation + restitution
  1. The definite and substantial character of the action or forbearance in relation to the remedy sought
  1. The extent to which the action or forbearance corroborates evidence of the making and terms of the promise, or the making and terms are otherwise established by clear and convincing evidence
  1. The reasonableness of the action or forbearance
  1. The extent to which the action or forbearance was foreseeable by the promisor

### *Crabtree v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp*

P alleges he entered a contract with D to serve as a sales manager for 2 years. In negotiations, he insisted on a definite term of employment. Parties eventually agree to contract in which P would receive periodic increases in pay over the course of two, as evidenced by unsigned memo. P receives first pay increase, as evidenced by payroll change card signed by authorized employee of D. Upon date where P was scheduled to receive 2nd pay increase, D refused to approve it. P ends employment and brings suit. D asserts SoF as a defense to enforcement.  **To satisfy the statute of frauds, the memorandum evidencing the contract may be pieced together out of separate writings. All material terms must be set out in various writings and at least one writing must be signed while the unsigned document must on its face refer to the same subject matter or transaction as that set forth in the one unsigned. Oral testimony allowed to link writings even though they didn’t expressly refer to each other.** Court holds that it is apparent that each of the separate writings refer to the same transactions on their face, and if not, the references made in the writings are of the type that invite PE to furnish an explanation. Thus, court affirms lower TC's decision to admit PE and ultimately award judgement to P.

### *Beaver v. Brumlow*

Verbal agreement by D to sell land for a home site to P. P's take possession of land (with D's consent), liquidated retirement investments to finance home and improvements, purchased a house and moved it onto the property (to which expressly approved in writing), and began significant improvements to the land. Agreement never formalized despite P's wishes, and D's attempt to restructure agreement as a lease and evict Ps. Ps bring suit. D acknowledges verbal agreement but assert SoF as a defense. Court points to doctrine of part performance as a well-settled exception to the SoF in the jurisdiction. Where an oral contract not enforceable under SoF has been performed to such extent as to make it inequitable to deny effect to it, equity may remove it from the SoF and decree specific performance. **However, there must be performance unequivocally referable to the agreement, performance which alone and without the promise is unintelligible and what lead an outsider with knowledge of the circumstances (minus the oral agreement) to conclude such a contract existed**. Where a party takes possession of the property and makes valuable, permanent, and substantial improvements to it, specific performance usually result. Additionally, failure to specify price will not defeat contract where part performance and/or transfer has occurred (reasonable price supplied to prevent inequitable result). Thus, court affirms judgement ordering specific performance.

### Alaska Democratic Party v. Rice

D promises P a job. P moves to AK for that job. When she arrives, D tells her that she won't be able to have the position. P had a job in MD she alleges could have continued indefinitely, but had resigned from in reliance on D's promise. There was never a written agreement as required by SoF (2-year employment contract so § 110 one-year provision applies). Court applies **doctrine of promissory estoppel to enforce an oral contract that falls within scope of SoF**. Here, D should have reasonably expected to induce P's action by their promise (getting her to quit and move to Alaska was deliberate) and that reliance lead to damage (no jobless and on polar opposite side of country). Using criteria from § 139(2), court determines that circumstances are sufficient to remove the promise from the SoF and award damages as needed to avoid injustice.

## UCC Statute of Frauds and the Sale of Goods

* Differences from common law:
  * Sale of goods over $500
  * Possibly less terms needed
  * Merchant Confirmation Rule
    * Submit written confirmation a reasonable period of time after the contract was formed
    * Other party must receive confirmation, have reason to know its content (satisfy sub-part 1), and fail to object within 10 days
  * Specially manufactured goods exception
    * Justification - These goods are hard to resell because they are tailored to the specific buyer
  * Promissory estoppel exception (courts are split on whether it exists in UCC)
  * Seems to suggest that if it is clear there is a contract based on parties' intention to be bound, the SoF should not be a bar to enforcement
    * UCC makes exception if party admits, either explicitly or implicitly (through its conduct) that there is a contract
    * Courts have generally taken the view that wre the asserted contract is for one unit of the good in question, even payment of only part of the price is sufficient to validate the entire contract
  * Using SoF defense is equivalent of denying existence of enforceable K
    * Justified because once party acknowledges contract, thinks it is ok to go outside Sof

### Rules (UCC)

* **UCC §2-201: Statute of Frauds**
  * Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a K for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing
  * Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given w/in 10 days after it is received
  * A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable
    * If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the sellers’ business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; OR
    * If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; OR
    * With respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted. [part performance]

### *Buffaloe v. Hart*

Oral agreement for P to buy 5 barns for $20K (in 4 installments) from D. P had possession of barns because he had already been renting them. P then sells the barns to other buyers whom provided offers + down-payments. P writes first installment check to D, who accepts it. Next day, D informs that she changed mind and sold to other party. P brings suit. Court applies UCC since barns are moveable and in excess of $500. **Under UCC, check is a sufficient writing if it indicates contract of sale between parties and is signed by the party (or agent) against whom enforcement is sought**. Here, the check was signed by P and not D, so check is not sufficient to satisfy UCC writing requirement. However, UCC also holds that SoF can be satisfied where there is delivery by the seller and unconditional/voluntary acceptance by the buyer that can be inferred by his conduct, such as through taking physical possession of the good. This also applies to buyer, who is expected to deliver something accepted by the buyer as performance. Since P had already taken possession of the land and D appeared to have accepted check, the conduct of the party is sufficient to indicate existence of a contract to a reasonable mind
