# Avoiding Enforcement - Incapacity, Bargaining Misconduct, Unconscionability, and Public Policy

## Incapacity

* Infancy/Minority Doctrine
  * **Traditional Rule**: A minor who disaffirmed a contract for the purchase of a good is not required to make restitution to the seller for substantial diminution in the goods value absent a showing that the minor misrepresented his age or willfully destroyed the property. The fact that the minor has benefited from a service/good in the past is not grounds to deny right of avoidance.
    * Limitation on necessaries. Minor liable for the value of items one needs to live (i.e. food, clothing, and shelter)
    * Court views obligation to make restitution is to bind minor to obligation they have privilege to avoid under the law
    * *Dodson v. Shrader* departs from this traditional rule
* Incapacity due to mental illness
  * **Modern approach** asserts "where a person has some understanding of a particular transaction which is affected by mental illness or defects, the controlling consideration is whether the transaction in its result is one which a reasonably competent person might have made"
    * Inquiry into capacity focuses on understanding or conduct at time of transaction only
    * Contrasted with Minority Doctrine - Whereas minor can generally disaffirm even if restoration cannot be made, mentally incompetent person is required to make restoration unless special circumstances are present
  * **Traditional "cognitive" test** is an inquiry into a persons capacity to understand the nature of a transaction
* Contract can be rendered void for incapacity in other contexts, such as intoxication, if demonstrated that the other party in a transaction had reason to know of the other's inability to understand the nature and consequences of the transaction

### Rules - Incapacity

* **R2d § 14 - Infants**
  * Unless a statue provides otherwise, a natural person has the capacity to incur only voidable contractual duties until the beginning of the day before the person's 18th birthday
  * Comment c -If consideration has been dissipated while in the minor's possession, the other party is without remedy unless the infant ratifies the contract after coming of age
* **R2d § 15 - Mental Illness or Defect**
  * Person incurs voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness if he is unable to reasonably understand the nature/consequences of the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition
  * Where other party is without knowledge or of reason to know of the mental illness or defect, the power of avoidance terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be unjust
* **R2d § 16 - Intoxicated Person**
  * Person incurs voidable contractual duties by entering into transaction if the other party has reason to know that by reason of intoxication he is unable to understand the nature/consequences of the transaction

### *Dodson v. Shrader*

P is a minor who purchases truck from D. Truck experienced engine issues and ultimately blew up. P tried to rescind purchase and requested refund, but D refused. P brought action seeking to avoid contract under infancy doctrine. In balancing rights of innocent merchants and protection of minors, court adopts rule that **minor is not permitted to recover full amount without allowing compensation for any depreciation or damage to the purchase while in their possession. Where the minor has not been subject to overreach or undue influence and the contract is fail/reasonable, the minor may recover the purchase price less reasonable compensation to the vendor for the use of, depreciation or willful/negligent damage to the goods while in the minor's possession.**

### *Sparrow v. Demonico*

P claims that mediation agreement was unenforceable because it she had experienced a mental breakdown at the time of assenting and lacked the capacity to authorize such an agreement. Court acknowledges the possibility of avoiding a contract due to mental/emotional related incapacity at the time of the transaction, even if the condition is not chronic or persistent. However, court also recognized the placement of **burden on P to provide medical evidence supporting claim of incapacity** is important to guard against fraudulent claims or plaintiffs who innocently, yet erroneously, convince themselves of suffering distress. Since P failed to provide medical evidence of her condition or evidence that her condition could feasibly result from the alleged cause, the court held there is no evidence that a reasonably competent person would not have entered into it.

## Duress and Undue Influence

* Basic formulation of standard for duress
  1. One party involuntarily accepted terms of another
  1. Circumstances permitted no other alternative
     * "No choice but to agree to the other party's terms or face serious financial hardship"
     * "What constitutes a reasonable alternative is a question of fact depending on the circumstances of each case"
  1. Such circumstances were result of wrongful coercive acts of the other party ("actual inducement")
     * No analytically precise standard of "wrongfulness" is provided, but courts have held that such an act need not be illegal.
       * Can be a breach of the duty of good faith or fair dealing
       * Would harm the recipient and would not significantly benefit the party making the threat
     * In the context of economic duress, there must thus be a showing that duress resulted from D's wrongful and oppressive conduct and not by P's necessities
* Other formulations emphasize the suppression of ones free will and judgement
  * Those claiming coercion typically seek to avoid the contract or any modifications/settlements

### Rules - Duress

* **R2d § 174 - When Duress by Physical Compulsion Prevents Formation of a Contract**
  * If a party is compelled by physical duress to assent, assent is ineffective
* **R2d § 175 - When Duress by Threat Makes a Contract Voidable**
  * If a party’s assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the K is voidable by the victim
  * If a party’s assent is induced by someone who is not a party to the K, the K is voidable by the victim unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the duress either gives value or relies materially on the transaction
* **R2d §176 - When a Threat is Improper**
  * A threat is improper if
    * What is threatened is a crime or a tort, or the threat itself would be a crime or a tort if it resulted in obtaining property,
    * What is threatened is a criminal prosecution
    * What is threatened is the use of civil process and the threat is made in bad faith, or
    * The threat is a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing
  * A threat is improper if the resulting exchange is not on fair terms, and
    * The threatened act would harm the recipient and would not significantly benefit the party making the threat,
    * The effectiveness of the threat in inducing the manifestation of assent is significantly increased by prior unfair dealing by the party making the threat, or
    * What is threatened is otherwise a use of power for illegitimate ends
* **R2d § 177 -  When Undue Influence Makes a Contract Voidable**
  * Undue influence is unfair persuasion of a party who is under the domination of the person exercising the persuasion or who by virtue of the relation between them is justified in assuming that that person will not act in a manner inconsistent with his welfare
  * A party’s assent, if induced by other party’s undue influence, makes the K voidable by the victim
  * If a party’s manifestation of assent is induced by one who is not a party to the transaction, the contract is voidable by the victim unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the undue influence either gives value or relies materially on the transaction

### *Totem v. Alyeska Pipeline*

P and D in contractual relationship to transport pipeline construction materials. After several unexpected delays, D terminated the contract. P submits termination invoices to which D is unable to provide a timeline for payment. Strapped for cash and under pressure from several other creditors, P agrees to settlement for substantially less than original invoices. P later brings action seeking full payment under claim that the release was agreed to under economic duress and that P had full knowledge of P's vulnerable state and used it as leverage to reach a settlement. Court rules that the claim economic duress, P must demonstrate that it had no reasonable choice but to agree to the other party's terms or face serious financial hardship and that the lack of reasonable alternatives was the result of D's wrongful conduct. Court found the circumstances surrounding the claim, that D exploited P's impending bankruptcy to reach a settlement, might reasonably support finding of D's conduct as wrongful. Thus court concludes the claim is improperly disposed off in the lower court's granting of summary judgement.

## Misrepresentation and Nondisclosure

* Rescission
  * Equitable remedy commonly used is instances of misrepresentation and nondisclosure
    * In such cases under modern law, victim has choice between tort action for damages or avoiding the contract by way of rescission
  * Judicial return of the parties to the status quo that existed before the contract was formed
    * Requires injured party to return any money or property he has received
    * May not be available where property has since been transferred to another party
* Fraudulent Inducement:
  1. Defendant made false representations as a statement of existing and material fact
  1. Defendant know representations to be false or made them recklessly without knowledge
  1. Defendant made representations intentionally for the purpose of inducing another party to act upon them
  1. Other party reasonably relied and acted upon representations - a representation is material when so substantial as to influence the other party
  1. Other party sustained damages
* Fraud by Silence (Fraudulent Nondisclosure):
  1. Defendant had knowledge of material facts not reasonably discoverable by other party
  1. Defendant under obligation to communicate such facts
  1. Defendant intentionally failed to do so
  1. Plaintiff reasonably relied on defendants representations as being complete and sustained damages as a result
  * Court may take into account differences in the levels of intelligence between parties, the nature of the relationship, and the degree to which information is readily discoverable or verifiable.
* Negligent Misrepresentation
  1. Person supplying false information has failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining/communicating the information
  1. Person relying upon false information is the intended beneficiary of the information supplied
  1. Damages are suffered by relying party in transaction that negligent party is trying to influence

### Rules - Misrepresentation 

* **R2d § 164** - A contract is voidable if a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying.
  * "Material" misrepresentations may be made innocently but nonetheless render contract unavoidable
* **R2d § 162** - Defines fraudulent to include an assertion made as true but without knowledge or confidence by the maker whether it is true or false, and thus may include statements that are made recklessly or negligently
  * An opinion defines an express of a belief, without certainty, as the existence of a fact. These are typically given a certain degree of leeway, but statements of opinion may be actionable in certain relationships (e.g. fiduciary, expert reliance, etc.)
  * An opinion can also be actionable for misrepresentation if it can be demonstrated that it was not genuinely held

### Syester v. Banta

Over period of several years, 68 year old widow pays D in return over 3000 hours of dance lessons. D's inducement of the sale of the lessons is borderline exploitative and fraudulent. After P terminates relationship with P and expresses intent to bring action, D uses questionable tactics in order to sign a release containing terms which, if signed in good faith, would bar all claims related to the transactions between D and P. D asserts the terms of the release as a defense, but jury awards judgement in favor of P. Court asserts **a settlement/release fairly entered into is binding and enforceable unless there exists fraud in its execution**. To claim fraud, one must establish (1) a representation was made, (2) it was false, (3) it was material, (4) the party making the statement knew it was false, (6) the injured party relied upon the statement in entering into the contract Upon appeal, CoA determined that the jury was properly instructed and, as a questions of fact, court held there was reasonable evidence that might reasonably support finding of misrepresentation if believed by the jury. Finally, court affirmed the award of punitive damages, citing the "greed and avariciousness" demonstrated by D.

### Stechschulte v. Jennings

D enters agreement to sell home to P. Over duration of D's ownership, there had been issues with water leaks to which D consulted with a contractor and ultimately applied temporary solution. In disclosure addendum section related to leakage, repairs, and stains, D failed to indicate these issues. Instead, he suggested that full warranty repairs had corrected the issue. P signs disclosure section with terms acknowledging the claims were made to the best of the non-expert seller's knowledge and that there is no reliance on any representations except those fully set forth in writing. P takes ownership of the home and then brings action against D after experiencing leakage. D claims the Buyer Acknowledgement as a defense. Lower court awards summary judgement in favor of D. State supreme court holds that P's acknowledgement there their was no reliance on representations made by the seller does not extend do the disclosures made in (or intentionally omitted from) the disclosure form. Thus, the Buyer Acknowledgement form does not protect D against failure to make accurate and complete disclosures. Court found that D's statements and omitted facts in the disclosure reasonably support the contention that D failed to make complete and accurate representations. Thus, court rules summary judgement was improperly awarded and remands all claims to lower court.

## Unconscionability

* Definition
  * One party’s lack of meaningful choice (typically due to lack of understanding or unequal bargaining power), K terms unreasonably favor the other party
  * Idea that a grossly unfair bargain should be unenforceable
  * Judged as to the time the K is made; not based on developments after K formed
* Procedural and Substantive Unconscionability
  * Need both, but on a sliding scale
  * **Procedural** - What went into the process of making the K; conspicuousness + intelligibility of a clause; oppression or surprise because of the unequal bargaining power (may reflect lack of choice);
  * **Substantive** - Terms that are “overly harsh” or one-sided; outrageously unfair so as to shock the judicial conscience; no many would accept; commercially unreasonable; applies to purpose + effect of the terms along with allocation of risk between the parties

### Rules - Unconscionability

* **R2d § 208 - Unconscionable Contract or Term**
  * If a court finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at formation, it may refuse to enforce the contract, enforce it without unconscionable clause, or limit application of clause so as to avoid an unconscionable result
* **UCC § 2-302 - Unconscionable Contract or Clause**
  1. Identical to R2d §208
  1. When unconscionability is claimed, parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect

### *Williams v. Walker-Thomas*

Furniture store (D) leases items to customers who make series of installment payments. Ownership is not conferred until final payment is made, at which point title passes to customer. Lease agreements contained unique provision that every time a new item was leased by a customer, balance would be dispersed across all items previously leased. This would allow D to repossess all previous purchase by that customer. P buys stereo and defaults, resulting in D repossessing all items. P sues on unconscionability grounds and trial court grants judgement for D. CoA rejects lower court holding that it lacked power to deny enforcement on unconscionability grounds. Court defines unconscionability as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties combined with terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party. CoA adopts rule that **contracts containing element of unconscionability should not be enforced and the court should determine this in light of the circumstances**.

### *Higgins v. Superior Court of LA County*

P's are orphaned and are taken in by family. P's are featured on television program where family's home is renovated. Contract contained arbitration clause. After show and renovation, family kicks out P's from home. P sues and family and TV producers, whom petition to enforce arbitration clause. P contends clause was unconscionable. Court identifies **two different components to unconscionability: procedural (oppression or surprise because of the unequal bargaining power) and substantive (terms that are “overly harsh” or one-sided). Both must be present in order for there to be unconscionability (though not to the same extent).** Court finds procedural - P wasn't party who drafted K (i.e. contract of adhesion), there was no attempt to highlight clause, and Ps were young, unsophisticated, and vulnerable. Court also finds substantive component - th clause is only applicable to disputes raised by P, thus D can compel arbitration but still allow themselves to seek relief in court if necessary.

### *Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Brown*

P reluctant to sign loan agreement, but after several calls from D urging her to do so, she signs 81 page document containing significantly different terms than those offered to her and excluded documents that would by conducive to her understanding. P defaults and brings suit. TC awards damages to P and D appeals. CoA holds that mortgage is unconscionable if party conceals important terms with the intent to mislead and induce borrower to enter agreement. Clearly an element of procedural unconscionability based on parties' relative bargaining power. CoA also found the exorbitant cost of the loan to be evidence of substantive unfairness. Hence, TC ruled properly in declaring contract unconscionable.

## Public Policy

* Process of contract formation is untainted but a K may still be unenforceable because the K itself violates or runs contrary to public policy and can be voided
  * Comes up in context of family law/children + covenants not to compete. Classic example is contract to commit a crime
  * There is also a strong policy interest in freedom of contract so there must be a well-established basis for any public policy that would deny enforcement of a K

### Rules - Public Policy

* **R2d §178 - When a Term is Unenforceable on Public Policy Grounds**
  1. A promise or other term of an agreement is unenforceable on public policy grounds if legislation provides that it is unenforceable or the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed by a public policy against its enforcement [balancing test]
  1. In weighing the interest in the enforcement of a term, take account of:
     * the parties’ justified expectations
     * any forfeiture that would result if enforcement were denied, and
     * any special public interest in the enforcement of the particular term
  1. In weighing a public policy against enforcement of a term, take account of:
     * the strength of that policy as manifested by legislation or judicial decisions
     * the likelihood that a refusal to enforce the term will further that policy
     * the seriousness of any misconduct involved and the extent to which it was deliberate
     * the directness of the connection between that misconduct and the term.

### *Valley Medical Specialists v. Farber*

Physician (D) with specialized area of practice enters employment contact containing a restrictive covenant (non-compete) with P. After D ends employment and begins practicing in the same area, P brings action for break and seeks injunction. Court asserts that **a covenant is not valid unless it protects some legitimate business interest outside of simply shielding a business from competition**. It also acknowledge doctor-patient relationship is special and not like ordinary commercial contexts because  free movement and competition among physicians is a prerequisite to optimal care, thus it must consider the reasonableness in each case. **A covenant is unreasonable if it provides restrictions greater than that needed to protect and employer's legitimate interests or is outweighed by the detriment to the employee or public** (e.g. patients). Court finds both to be true in this case, thus the covenant is unenforceable on public policy grounds

### *In re Baby*

TN Supreme Court holds that **a contract is unenforceable on public policy grounds only when its terms clearly violate the public policy of the state**. Since state took neutral legislative stance on surrogacy arrangements, there is no clear public policy prohibiting such agreements. However, surrogacy contracts may not circumvent the statutes governing a person’s status as a legal parent or the statutory procedures for terminating parental rights. Here, the portion of the juvenile court’s order terminating the surrogate's parental rights prior to childbirth in the absence of statutory authority contravenes public policy
