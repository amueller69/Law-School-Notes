# Restitution

## Unjust Enrichment and Pure Restitution

* Restitution is a remedy used when one person is unjustly enriched at the expense of another, typically when there is a failure to exchange promises/some other problem in K formation
* Two central elements of restitutionary recovery:
  1. Enrichment of one person - Some sort of benefit conferred upon an individual unofficiously
     * Person acting officiously (i.e. "thrusting" their services on another and demanding payment) is not entitled to restitution
  1. Circumstances where the retention of benefits without recompense would be unjust to another person
     * Person acting without intent to charge (i.e. offered as a gift) is also not entitled to restitution
* Restatement (Third) on Restitution:
  * § 1 - A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is subject to liability in restitution
  * § 20/21 - Protection of Another’s Life or Health/Property
    * A person who provides care required for the protection of another’s health or property is entitled to restitution to the extent needed to prevent unjust enrichment (measured by a reasonable charge for the services in question), if the circumstances justify (i.e. emergency/necessary services OR reasonable to assume person would consent) the decision to intervene without request
* Contract implied in law
  * An obligation imposed by law, regardless of either parties assent, applied as a legal fiction to remedy unjust enrichment
  * Commonly referred to as a quasi-contract, though restitution and unjust enrichment don't always arise in contractual contexts
  * Unlike true contracts, they do not arise under the traditional bargaining process and are not subject to the same rules
* Contract implied in fact
  * Distinct from restitutionary claim insofar as the party receiving the benefit requested it
  * Law infers a bargain to pay
  * Like express contracts, contracts implied in fact are real contracts

### *Credit Bureau Enterprises, Inc. v. Pelo*

D involuntarily hospitalized and refuses to provide compensation for hospitalization because it was both unnecessary and agreed to under duress. Hospital assigns claim to P for collection. P ultimately unsuccessfully sought judgement in small claims court and appealed. Decision was reversed and D appealed. Court references Restatement of Restitution §116 which asserts **a person who has supplied services to another (with intent to charge), despite acting without the other's consent, is entitled to restitution if the services were necessary to prevent the other from suffering serious harm* and there was no reason to know the person would not consent**. Facts surrounding D's hospitalization demonstrate that it was necessary at the time. Thus, D's refusal to assent to an express contract is irrelevant because he is legally obligated to pay for his services under an **implied contract in law**.

### *Watts v. Watts*

P and D ended a nonmarital cohabitatation relationship. P brought action claiming that she was entitled to equitable division of the couple's assets. Lower courts dismiss P's case for failure to state a claim. Court ultimately determines that P is able to a claim on two separate theories of recovery. The first of these theories is that P quit her job and career training in reliance on D's promise to support the family. The court holds that a change in one's circumstances in performance of an agreement seems to suggest there was indeed an agreement. Further, other courts have recognized domestic contributions as adequate consideration in an agreement to share property. Hence, the court rules D has pleaded the facts necessary to state a claim for breach of contract. The second theory of recovery was based onf D's acceptance and retention of P's services (both domestic and financial) with full knowledge of P's expectation of sharing wealth accumulated during their relationship. Court holds that **to recover for unjust enrichment, P must show that a benefit was conferred on D, knowledge/appreciation of the benefit by D, and acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances making it unequitable to do so**. Court determines P is able to demonstrate all of these elements and is therefore able to state a claim.

## Promissory Restitution

* Bears similarity to both classical contracts and pure restitution
  * Like classical contract insofar as the obligation rests on the assent of the promisor
  * Like pure restitution insofar as no bargain-for-exchange has taken place
* Material Benefit Rule
  * There is sufficient consideration in promise to pay for past services if promisee confers a material benefit upon the promisor, hence these type of promises are enforceable
  * Ratification theory - Promise to pay for material benefit accrued in the past can viewed as a ratification and therefore an implied invitation of this benefit
  * R2d § 86 asserts a variant of this rule
  * Not accepted by all courts
* Classic View
  * Moral obligation is not sufficient consideration by itself. The only exception is in cases where some obligation had previously existed but has since become unenforceable (e.g. due to passage of time)
  * While an individual may be bound by moral conscience to recompense for past services rendered, they are not bound by law
* Difference from pure restitution
  * Promissory restitution does not do much more than pure restitution, but such differences occur at the margins
* R2d
  * § 82 Promise to pay a prior contract debt is binding. Facts = promise in these scenarios:
    1. Voluntary ack of prior debt
    2. Voluntary transfer of money
    3. A statement that s.o.l. will not be used against other party
  * § 83 - Promise to pay debt, if made after bankruptcy proceedings, is binding
  * § 85 - A promise to perform a voidable contract is binding
  * § 86 - A promise made in recognition of a previous benefit is binding to prevent injustice. A binding promise must rest on an actual benefit, as opposed to pure gratitude or sentiment

### *Mills v. Wyman*

Son of D returns from voyage at sea gravely ill and is too poor to seek care. P gives provides him with shelter and comfort until he died. D writes letter to P showing gratitude for the care provided and promises to recompense for any expenses that had been incurred. D breaks promise and P subsequently brings action to recover.
Court identifies the general rule which maintains promises offered without consideration cannot be enforced, regardless of the moral implications. While acknowledging that some courts have recognized a moral obligation as sufficient consideration to a promise, the court asserts that this rule is to be limited to cases where some other consideration had previously existed. The services provided by P occurred before any promise was made and were not a benefit to D (in the legal sense). Thus, the court held that while D may be bound by conscience, he is not bound by law.

### *Webb v. McGowin*

P falls off of mill and is severely injured while attempting to prevent it from falling on top of D. P's injuries render him physically unable to work and D promises to pay $15/week out of gratitude for saving his life. D kept promise and made payments for 8 years until his death. P bringing action against D's estate for refusing to continue payments. The court applies rule where **there is sufficient consideration in promise to pay for past services if promisee confers a *material benefit* upon the promisor**. It also acknowledges the rule applied in *Mills v. Wyman* where for a moral obligation to constitute consideration there must have existed some prior legal obligation. However, it identifies qualification to this rule in cases where a material benefit is conferred. In such cases, subsequent promise to pay is a *ratification* of the benefit provided, suggesting a previous request/invitation for the benefit was implied. Saving D from serious bodily harm is a material benefit and it was provided to P's detriment. Hence, the court ruled that the agreement is enforceable.
