### *Katz v. Danny Dare, Inc.*

Not a contract because Katz incurred no legal detriment, as he had no unconditional right to remain employed.

**Facts**:
D offers P to pay an annuity in exchange for his early retirement. P acquiesces and eventually starts working part-time at another business. D ceases payments and is sued. Trial court rules in favor of D, reasoning agreement wasn't enforceable because P didn't have to do anything/give up any legal right and the alternative was termination.

**Ruling**:
In order for the doctrine of promissory estoppel to apply, there must be:

1. A promise
2. Detrimental reliance on that promise
3. Only way to avoid injustice is to enforce the promise

Court finds that there was clear and definite promise. It also determined that P voluntarily gave up earnings to his own detriment in exchange for the promise. It can't be said that termination was P's only alternative, as it was clear D was taking every measure to avoid doing so. Finally, court held corrective justice was necessary as there is other way for P to recover lost earnings in reliance on D's promise. Hence, the court reverses trial court's decision.

### *Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A.*

**Look at notes on pg. 248**

**Facts**:
P defaults on mortgage and files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. D, who purchased mortgage, promises to work with P on reinstatement/loan modification if P files for less protective Chapter 13 bankruptcy. D forecloses and doesn't attempt to co-operate until after the home was auctioned. P brings action seeking relief for promissory estoppel, among other claims.

**Ruling**:
Court identifies requirements for promissory estoppel claim as:

1. A promise on clear and unambiguous terms
2. Reliance by promisee
3. Expectation of reliance must be reasonable and forseeable by promisor
4. Promisee was injured by reliance

The court determined that D's promise was unambiguous: it wouldn't foreclose without first engaging it negotiations. Additionally, the court held that D should have foreseen P's reliance on the promise because it was offered for the sole purpose of inducing P to file Chapter 13, which it did. Finally, P's reliance on the promise resulted in several rights and protections under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be surrendered and this ultimately allowed D to foreclose. Thus, the court determined P stated a claim for promissory estoppel.
