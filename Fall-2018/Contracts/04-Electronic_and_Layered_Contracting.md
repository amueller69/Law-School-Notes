# Electronic and Layered Contracting

* Browse-wrap terms: internet provider has established terms of use of its website. Terms say that by using the site, the user agrees to the provider’s terms.
  * Terms normally accessible by clicking a button, but user is not required or even encouraged, to scroll through terms and is not required to click any agreement button.
  * User’s purported agreement to provider’s terms comes simply from browsing the site
    * e.g. “by accessing/browsing/using this site, you acknowledge that you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this site.”
    * Browse-wrap terms NOT considered part of the contract
      * Rationale - Do not necessarily know of the terms so you could not make a choice to accept
* Clickwrap terms
  * Before completing the purchase of the product, the purchaser must scroll through the seller’s terms of sale and click an “I agree” button. If the purchaser refuses to do so, the seller will not complete the sale
  * Treat additional term as an accepted part of the K unless unconscionable
    * Rationale - assume that if you clicked, you made a choice + made an autonomous decision
* Shrinkwrap agreements = purchaser orders a product and receives it. Often, but not always, a warning on the outside of the package informs the purchaser that the product contains the seller’s contract terms + that the use of the product constitutes the purchaser’s agreement with those terms. After removing the wrapping, the purchaser can inspect the product and review the contract terms
  * Terms tell purchaser that he may return product to seller w/in a certain # of days
  * Terms also say that if the purchaser does not return the product w/in that period of time, the purchaser agrees to the seller’s contract terms.
  * Majority rule: treat as part of the K. Minority rule: not part of the K
    * Rationale - practically forced to see terms/agreement; presume constructive knowledge

Focus is on the idea of consent. If there is consent (even if we know that no one reads), uphold. Majority courts are not compelled by disparities in bargaining power. They favor the seller’s efficiency interest (selling to so many individuals). Courts feel they should leave the issue of unequal bargaining power to the legislature

* Burden falls on seller to show reasonable invitation in clearly expressed terms
* Vendor makes offer by shipping goods and is thereby the master

* Perspective A - Ps do not enter contract at the time of purchase, but by expressly providing the terms and conditions with delivery of goods. Retaining the goods beyond the specified period is an acceptance
  * Easterbrook identifies this as the most efficient approach, as it provides predictability and lowers transaction costs
  * UCC § 2-207 does not apply under this approach because no binding agreement exists before delivery, hence no terms are changed or modified
* Perspective B - P's enter agreement at time of purchase. Any terms and conditions that were not expressed at the time of purchase are thus viewed as additions.
  * UCC § 2-207 establishes rule that proceeding with contract after a change or addition in terms is no sufficient to show consent. Not binding unless party expressly agrees
  * This would require sellers of goods to disclose full terms and conditions at the point of sale
    * Might be unreasonable or too burdensome, especially where there are several terms/conditions
