# Electronic and Layered Contracting

## In General

* Browse-wrap terms: internet provider has established terms of use of its website. Terms say that by using the site, the user agrees to the provider’s terms.
  * Terms normally accessible by clicking a button, but user is not required or even encouraged, to scroll through terms and is not required to click any agreement button.
  * User’s purported agreement to provider’s terms comes simply from browsing the site
    * e.g. “by accessing/browsing/using this site, you acknowledge that you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this site.”
    * Browse-wrap terms NOT considered part of the contract
      * Rationale - Do not necessarily know of the terms so you could not make a choice to accept
* Clickwrap terms
  * Before completing the purchase of the product, the purchaser must scroll through the seller’s terms of sale and click an “I agree” button. If the purchaser refuses to do so, the seller will not complete the sale
  * Treat additional term as an accepted part of the K unless unconscionable
    * Rationale - assume that if you clicked, you made a choice + made an autonomous decision
* Shrinkwrap agreements
  * Purchaser orders a product and receives it. Often, but not always, a warning on the outside of the package informs the purchaser that the product contains the seller’s contract terms + that the use of the product constitutes the purchaser’s agreement with those terms. After removing the wrapping, the purchaser can inspect the product and review the contract terms
  * Terms tell purchaser that he may return product to seller w/in a certain # of days
  * Terms also say that if the purchaser does not return the product w/in that period of time, the purchaser agrees to the seller’s contract terms.
  * Perspective A (Layered/Rolling Theory) - Ps do not enter contract at the time of purchase, but by expressly providing the terms and conditions with delivery of goods. Retaining the goods beyond the specified period is an acceptance
    * Burden falls on seller to show reasonable invitation in clearly expressed terms
    * Vendor makes offer by shipping goods and is thereby the master
    * Easterbrook identifies this as the most efficient approach, as it provides predictability and lowers transaction costs
    * UCC § 2-207 does not apply under this approach because no binding agreement exists before delivery, hence no terms are changed or modified
  * Perspective B - P's enter agreement at time of purchase. Any terms and conditions that were not expressed at the time of purchase (i.e. shrinkwrapped terms) are thus viewed as proposal for additions.
    * UCC § 2-207 establishes rule that proceeding with contract after a change or addition in terms is no sufficient to show consent. Not binding unless party expressly agrees.
    * Easterbrook: This would require sellers of goods to disclose full terms and conditions at the point of sale
      * Might be unreasonable or too burdensome, especially where there are several terms/conditions

### *DeFontes v. Dell, Inc*

P brought a class action suit on behalf of purchasers of D's computers and service contracts. D contends the proceedings and compel arbitration as required by the terms and conditions agreement and that, by accepting delivery, the purchaser agreed to all terms. The document did not state that the purchaser could reject the terms by returning the computer, but did provide that the customer could return the computer if not satisfied. TC found that the opportunities to review the terms and conditions were insufficient to give rise to a contractual obligation. D appealed. CoA holds that a  when a product is delivered with a shrinkwrap agreement, additional terms become part of the contract, provided the agreement expressly gives the consumer the right to reject by returning the product for a refund in a reasonable time. However, the **purchaser of goods will only be bound by additional terms in a shrinkwrap agreement if the agreement makes clear that the purchaser can reject the terms by returning the goods** It is unreasonable to expect a seller to inform a consumer of every term at the moment of a purchase. **Formation is complete once the purchaser accepts the terms after a reasonable time to reject**. Since terms and conditions failed to make clear that it could reject terms by rejecting goods, court rules the additional shrinkwrap terms are not binding. TC decision was affirmed.

### **Feldman v. Google**

P bought ads from D through pay per click advertising, where he’d be charged every time someone clicked on his ad. P contends that he did not have notice of and did not assent to the agreement, despite "Yes I agree to terms” before being allowed to proceed with ad purchase (this is necessary step). **A “clickwrap” internet agreement will be enforced if it sufficiently provides the user reasonable notice of the agreement’s applicable terms and conditions.** Traditional contract law principles apply to click-wrap agreements: **need reasonable notice of terms and manifestation of assent**. Click-wraps normally achieve both. Court found that a reasonably prudent internet user would have been aware of terms and that P manifested assent by clicking “Yes I agree”. Thus, the terms of the agreement were binding despite his failure to read them.

### **Hines v. Overstock**

P did not scroll down to the bottom of the page to view the terms because it was not necessary to do so to effectuate purchase. D attempts to enforce arbitration clause contained in these terms, arguing that visitors accept them when making purchase on the site. Link to terms not prominently displayed, nor did not prompt users to review the terms prior to the purchase. **An Internet purchase agreement that fails to provide a consumer with adequate notice of its terms and conditions is not enforceable**. Court holds that this does not constitute actual or constructive notice of the terms, hence the arbitration clause is not binding.
