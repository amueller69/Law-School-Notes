# Consequences of Nonperformance

## Express Conditions

* Conditions
  * R2d § 224 - An event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due
  * R2d § 226 - An event may be made a condition either by the agreement of the parties or by a term supplied by the court.
  * Used to protect parties against various types of risk, including those that would affect the value of future performance
  * Often an event in which a contractual party has some, albeit limited, control over
  * Uncertainty is necessary. The mere passage of time, to which there is no uncertainty, can't be conditioned on
  * Non-occurrence is not breach unless duty of party was to bring about its occurrence
  * Usually required to be expressed in clear and unambiguous language
  * A condition subsequent is a duty owed but subject to discharge on the happening of an event after that duty had already arisen
* Distinction between express conditions and promises
  * Condition requires strict compliance to be satisfied
  * Substantial performance is not applicable to conditions
* R2d § 225 - Effects of the Non-Occurrence of a Condition
  1. Performance of a duty subject to a condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its non-occurrence is excused
  1. Unless it has been excused, the non-occurrence of a condition discharges the duty when the condition can no longer occur
  1. Non-occurrence of a condition is not a breach by a party unless he has a duty that the condition occur
* Express conditions are strictly enforced with the following exceptions:
  * Disproportionate Forfeiture - Nonoccurence excused to prevent forfeiture
  * Waiver - Obligor whose duty is expressly dependent on a condition may be under a duty to perform despite the nonoccurence of that condition if he has, by word or conduct, waived the right to insist on fulfillment of the condition before performing the duty
    * R2d § 84 - Waiver is effective without consideration or reliance but only if condition was immaterial and the other party did not assume risk of its non-occurrence
  * Estoppel - A material condition can be overcome by estoppel based on obligor's expression of intention not to insist on it followed by obligee's prejudicial reliance
  * Prevention of Condition - Condition excused if the promisor wrongfully hinders or prevents condition from occurring
* Forfeiture
  * R2d § 229 - Refers to the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantial, as by preparation or performance on the expectation of that exchange. In determining whether forfeiture is disproportionate, court must weight extent of obligee's forfeiture against importance to obligor of the risk from which he sought to be protected and the degree to which that protection will be lost if condition is excused. Court may excuse the nonoccurrence of a condition where disproportionate forfeiture would otherwise result, unless the conditioning event was a material part of the parties’ exchange
* **Decision Tree**
  1. Is it an express condition?
  2. If yes, no need to perform if not satisfied UNLESS
     * Waived : obligee waived the right to insist on fulfillment of the condition before performing [where non-material to the agreed exchange OR consideration received for the waiver despite fact that it is a material change]
     * Excused
       * Non material AND forfeiture (non-occurrence of the condition would cause disproportionate forfeiture on the part of the obligee)
       * Party in breach contributes to non-occurrence of the condition (some courts hold possibility of prevention of the condition by the obligor was a risk assumed by the obligee)

### *enXco Development Corp v. Norther States Power Co.*

Contract allows termination upon condition of failure of P to obtain a license necessary to proceed with wind-energy project. P doesn't apply for license until late. P encounters delays that result in them failing to obtain the license in time. D terminates the contract, causing P to lose millions since resale price of the infrastructure it had purchased had significantly declined. D also had economic incentive to avoid contract as the profitability of wind-energy had decreased since the project's outset. P brings suit for breach, asserting doctrines of temporary impracticability and disproportionate forfeiture as defenses to strict enforcement of the condition precedent. CoA asserts **impracticability requires the party be without fault and only excuses condition precedent of the condition is not a material part of the contract and forfeiture would result**. CoA rules this is not applicable to P since it waited nearly 2 years to apply for license and the various delays were reasonably foreseeable. It also rules there was no disproportionate forfeiture as P retained all of the project assets and real property.

### *J.N.A. Realty Corp. v. Cross Bay Chelsea, Inc.*

D leased commercial property to a restaurant for a 10-year term, with an option to renew for another 10-year term. The lease required the restaurant to inform D at least six months prior to the end of the lease term if it wished to exercise the option. P buys lease from restaurant and has it modified so the option would increase to 24 years. D regularly informed P about lease obligations, but never provided reminder notifications about the lease extension. P is notified two weeks before expiration that they need to vacate and D refused to honor exercise option since deadline had passed. Court holds that tenant may suffer forfeiture when negligently failing to exercise option to extend lease when it has made in good faith improvements to the property intending to renew a lease. Court must weigh gravity of the fault by negligent party with the gravity of the hardship. In such case, **if landlord would not be prejudiced by the delay in notice and the lessee would sustain substantial loss otherwise, then there is equitable interest in protecting against this forfeiture**. Hence, court rules the case should not have been dismissed.

## Material Breach

* Constructive Conditions
  * Doctrine dealing with one party's performance being dependent (conditioned) on, though not expressly, the performance of the other party's performance.
  * If one party fails to perform or tender performance, is it sufficient justification for the other party to withhold their performance?
  * Minor or immaterial deviations from the contract do not amount to failure of a condition to the other party's performance
* Willful Breach - May or may not bar recovery when there is substantial performance
  * Cordozo in *Jacob & Youngs* - Willful transgressor not able to recover under the substantial performance doctrine
    * Other cases have relied on this
  * Corbin - Willful breach does not automatically bar recovery, but motive of breaching party is factor in determining substantial performance
* Total Breach
  * Does not mean party has breached **all** of their obligations, but that breach is sufficiently serious to justify discharging the other party
  * Significant from partial breach in two ways:
    1. Partial breach does not discharge non-failing party
    1. Total breach allows injured party to recover both actual and future damages arising out of breach
  * Different from material breach insofar as material breach only suspends one's duty to perform. When material becomes total in §242, party is discharged from performing.
* Restatement (Second)
  * §234 - Order of Performance
    * Performances that can be rendered at the same time are due simultaneously unless otherwise prescribed in contract
  * §235 - Performance, Breach, and Discharge
    * Full performance of duty under contract discharges duty
    * When performance of duty under contract is due, any non-performance is a breach
  * §237 - Effect on Other Party's Duties of a Failure to Render Performance
    * It is a condition of each party's remaining duties to render performance that there be no **material** failure by the other party to render performance at an earlier time
      * Comment a - Material failure to perform suspends, at least temporarily, other party's duty and discharges it can no longer occur
    * §241 - Determining Material Failure
      * Following circumstances are significant in determining whether failure to render performance is material:
        1. Extent to which the injured party will be deprived of expected benefit
        1. Extent to which injured party can be adequately compensated for deprived benefit
        1. Extent to which party failing to perform will suffer forfeiture
        1. Likelihood party failing to perform will cure failure in light of circumstances
        1. Extent to which party failing to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing
    * §242 - Determining Discharge of Duties
      * Following factors relevant in determining whether material failure discharges remaining duties:
        1. Those stated in §241
        1. Extent to which delay would prevent injured party from making substitute arrangements
        1. Extent to which extent to which agreement provides for performance without delay (time is of the essence clause)
* UCC
  * §2-601 - Buyer's Rights (Perfect Tender Rule)
    * Buyer can reject goods if they or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to contract, regardless of how material
      * If choose to accept, this decision is final if seller knows of acceptance
  * §2-601 - Rightful Rejection
    * Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless buyer notifies seller
  * §2-508 - Revocation of Acceptance
    * Buyer can revoke acceptance of goods whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value if it was accepted on the assumption that the non-conformity would be cured and wasn't or if non-conformity wasn't discovered either by difficulty or seller's assurance
    * Must occur within reasonable time after buyer gains grounds to revoke 
  * §2-508 - Cure of Improper Tender
    * Seller can cure goods rejected for non-conformance my notifying buyer and doing so within period for which performance is allowed
    * Seller can have further reasonable time to substitute conforming tender if they had grounds to believe original tender was acceptable and notification is given to buyer
  
### *Jacob & Youngs, Inc. v. Kent*

P is a general contractor that built residence for D. Contract stated that P was to be paid $77,000 and included specification that all pipes used be manufactured in Reading, PA. About a year after construction is completed, D learns that pipes not in spec. Replacement of the pipe, however, would require substantial additional work and expense by P. Additionally, the pipe used was of the same quality and was only supplied due to innocent mistake by P. P doesn't fix and D refuses to make final payment on contract. P brings uit. TC denies introduction of evidence showing pipe installed was of the same quality as Reading pipe, leading jury to find for D. The CoA reversed and granted a new trial. State supreme court must balance purpose of the contract with fairness of making P correct defect or liable for breach. Deviations from contract where purpose is frustrated outweigh fairness to party that fails to fully perform. However, where significance of the default (in light of the purpose) is small in comparison to the oppression of the forfeiture or burden of correction, courts become more flexible. Court  **owner is entitled to money which would enable him to complete partial performance, unless cost of completion is grossly/unfairly disproportionate to good being attained, in which case the measure should be the difference in value.** In this case, where cost of replacing piping would be very expensive, court holds that allowance to D should be difference value between pipe used and Reading pipe, not the cost of replacement. Dissent argues P should not avoid liability for negligent failure to adhere to contract, regardless of quality.

### *Sacket v. Spindler*

D agrees to share stock to P in installment payments due on specific dates. Stock delivered in full once last payment made. P fails to make final payment on specified day. After several weeks of correspondence between parties and P's continued failure to make payment, D refused to sell. P sues for breach claiming D's refusal was an unlawful repudiation of the contract. D brings counterclaim for breach. TC rules in favor of D, holding P's failure to pay was breach. P appealed. CoA maintains **D's repudiation is justifiable if and only if P's failure to pay can be considered a total breach rather than a partial breach**. Extent of breach depends on materiality. Court considers factors for determining materiality as provided in the Restatement. They ultimately conclude D was justified in terminating the contract on the basis that Sackett's actions created extreme uncertainty as to if he would be able to perform. Also, P's failure to perform went beyond innocent negligence and could be categorized as willful.

## Anticipatory Repudiation

* Performance not yet due, but there are reasonable grounds to doubt the willingness or ability of the other party to perform. Anticipatory repudiation, and **advance refusal to perform**, guards against prospect of nonperformance without committing breach itself
  * Innocent party still runs the risk of breaching if anticipatory repudiation is not justified. Safer seek assurances rather than repudiate and be liable
* Distinguished from "material breach" (where other party is justified in treating her performance obligations as discharged) insofar as there is no total breach at the time of repudiation since performance is not yet due
* Party that issues anticipatory repudiation can generally still retract, unless:
  1. The other party relies and changes position
  1. The other party notifies of acknowledgement of the repudiation (through notification or its conduct)
* Restatement (Second)
  * § 250 A repudiation is:
    * A statement indicating that the obligor will commit a total, material breach OR a voluntary act which renders obligor unable or apparently unable to perform. If a statement, language must be reasonably interpreted to mean party cannot or will not perform (not merely doubtful or indefinite)
  * § 251 Failure to Give Assurance Treated as a Repudiation
    * Where reasonable to believe that obligor will totally breach, obligee may demand adequate assurances of performance and may, if reasonable, suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed exchange until he receives assurance
    * Obligee may treat as repudiation obligor’s failure to reassure within reasonable time
  * § 253 Breach + Discharge of Duties
    * Where obligor repudiates a duty before committing breach and before receiving all of the agreed exchange, repudiation alone gives rise to claim for damages for total breach
    * Where K requires performances, one party’s repudiation of duty to perform discharges other party’s remaining duties to perform
  * § 256 Retraction of anticipatory repudiation
    * Can retract a repudiation so long as other party has not materially changed his position in reliance on repudiation OR other party indicates to the repudiating party that he considers the repudiation final
* UCC
  * § 2-609 – Reasonable Assurances
    * When reasonable grounds for insecurity (according to commercial standards), party may demand (in writing, though not necessarily if done unambiguously) adequate assurance of due performance and may suspend any performance (if commercially reasonable) for which he has not received the agreed return until receive assurance.
    * Failure to provide assurance within reasonable time (no more than 30 days) can be construed as a repudiation
  * § 2-610 - Anticipatory Repudiation
    * If party 1 repudiates pre-performance, party 2 may await performance (for a commercially reasonable time), OR resort to remedy (even if he has notified repudiating party that he would await the latter’s performance and has urged retraction)
    * In either case, can suspend own performance, but if awaiting performance beyond commercially reasonable time, can’t recover avoidable damages
    * Not as strict as restatement when it comes to demonstrating intent not to perform: action which reasonably indicates a rejection of the continuing obligation is sufficient
  * § 2-611 - Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation
    * Can retract unless aggrieved party has materially changed his position or indicated that he considers the repudiation final
    * Retraction reinstates repudiating party’s rights under the K with due excuse + allowance to aggrieved party for any delay caused by the repudiation
* CISG
  * Reasonable time instead of 30 days
  * May suspend performance if apparent other party will not perform as result of some deficiency, his creditworthiness, or conduct in preparation to perform
  * Installment Ks are treated separately but if grounds to believe future installments will be breached, can declare future installments avoided

### *Truman L. Flatt & Sons Co. v. Schupf*

D agreed to sell P a parcel of land. Contract for sale of land was contingent upon P's successful rezoning of the property. P faced opposition to proposed rezoning at public meeting. P sends D a letter indicating that there was strong opposition to the rezoning request, but that it was still interested in the property though at a lower price since it is less valuable to them now. D responds to letter rejecting the requested modification of the price term. P sends another letter stating that it still intended to purchase the property for the original price. D responds by informing them they considered contract to be voided and won't be selling P the land. P brings action seeking specific performance and TC awards summary judgement in favor of D. P appeals, arguing its request to change the price didn't constitute a repudiation, and even if it did, it was quickly retracted. Referencing UCC, CoA holds that **language that under a fair reading, a statement of intention not to perform or to perform only if non-contractual conditions are met, constitutes a repudiation**. Court rules that P's letter was not a clearly implied threat of non-performance. Additionally, both UCC and Restatement provide that **repudiating party can retract the repudiation unless the other party has since cancelled or materially changed his position (in response to repudiation) or has otherwise indicated that they considered repudiation final**. Since D did not attempt to seek or sell the property to other buyers (i.e. no change in its position) and only provided notice that it considered the contract repudiated after the repudiation has been revoked, CoA determines TC erred in awarding summary judgement to D.

### Hornell Brewing Co. v. Spry

D approached P seeking distribution rights for Arizona Tea in Canada. P grants exclusive distribution rights in an oral agreement. D begins to fall behind on payments, but it informs P that it has secured a line of credit for $1.5 million. D continues to miss payments, leading P to send letter stating it would allow relationship to continue and extend allowable outstanding balance if D could show proof of line of credit. D doesn't respond so P moves to terminate relationship. D refuses to sign agreement ending relationship. P seeks declaratory judgement that relationship had been properly terminated. Court identifies UCC as controlling body of law. **UCC authorizes a party upon reasonable grounds for insecurity to demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance, if commercially reasonable, suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.**. The court holds that D's falling behind on payments was reasonable ground for insecurity and that P's request for adequate assurance was proper. P failed to substantiate its purported line of credit and thus multiple failures by D to respond constituted a repudiation.
