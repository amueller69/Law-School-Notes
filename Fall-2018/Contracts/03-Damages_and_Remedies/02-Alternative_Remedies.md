# Alternatives to Expectation Damages

## Reliance Damages

* Party can recover reliance damages for breach even if they can’t prove expectation damages with reasonable certainty
* A party may not recover money spent in reliance on the contract if it can be proven that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for the injured party
  * An award for reliance on the contract must reflect any loss that the injured party would have suffered had the contract been fully performed (subtracted from reliance damages)
  * Embodies principle that a party shouldn't be able to escape bad bargain through reliance damages
* An award of damages will not be reduced due to an injured party’s failure to mitigate when the facts are clear that both parties had the same opportunity to mitigate
* Promissory Estoppel Contexts
  * Judges have discretion to limit remedy as justice requires
    * May limit relief to damages measured by extent of reliance (i.e. out-of-pocket expenses) instead of full expectation damages
    * Majority of jurisdictions have adopted this approach
  * Some courts hold that relief P.E. cases should ALWAYS be measured by actual reliance
* R2d § 349 - Reliance Damages
  * As an alternative to expectation damages, the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest, including expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance, minus any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed (burden on D to show that the K would have been a losing one)

### *Wartzman v. Hightower Productions, Ltd.*

P establishes and capitalizes new corporation to finance attempt to break world record. D hired as law firm and provides guidance, though fails to comply with securities regulations and informs P that securities specialist needs to be hired to straighten things out. P can't afford it and D refuses to pay. Record breaking attempt indefinitely postponed. P brings suit. **If expectation damage for lost profits can’t be shown w/ reasonable certainty (i.e. too speculative) money spent in part performance, in preparation for, or in reliance on the K are recoverable**.  Court holds P was injured due to its reliance on the contract; it sold stock and incurred substantial obligations in reliance on the contract. Additionally, **if D can establish that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for P, then reliance damages can be limited or excluded altogether**. D was unable to establish that P would have suffered a net loss from its venture, so this exception is not applicable here. Court also found that P did not fail duty to mitigate as suggested by P. P lacked the funds necessary to hire a securities specialist, **a substantial obligation that P is not required to incur in order to mitigate**. Further, D had the same opportunity to mitigate and refused to do so. Thus, court holds P should be permitted to recover reliance damages.

### *Walser v. Toyota*

P initiates process to become dealer of cars sold by D. Three step process: Application, letter of intent containing conditions, and then formal agreement. P completes first step and D informs them that letter of intent approved and "they were [their] dealer". D later informs them that this was a mistake and letter had not been approved. P had already purchased facility for dealership. P files suit seeking full relief (including lost profits) under theories of breach and promissory estoppel. TC awards relief on promissory estoppel grounds, but limits damage to out of pocket expenditures, which was **price paid minus FMV**. P appeals. CoA points to Restatements description of remedies available in promissory estoppel cases, providing that, **where appropriate, relief may be limited to that measured by the extent of P's reliance rather than the terms of the contract. Thus, this places the damages decision within the trial judge’s discretion**. Here, D provided evidence showing that a formal dealership agreement was far from certain while P did not demonstrated any opportunity lost by virtue of relying on the promise. CoA asserts that it won't interfere with lower court discretionary decisions so long as it "remains within the range of choice" (it did), accounts for all relevant factors (it did), and does not constitute a clear error judgement (it doesn't). Thus, CoA affirms TC's judgement.
