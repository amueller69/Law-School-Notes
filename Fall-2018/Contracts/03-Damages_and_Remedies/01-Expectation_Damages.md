# Expectation Damages

## Contract Damages in General

* Three principle purposes for awarding contract damages
  1. Expectation – make whole through compensating as if fully performed
     * “Benefit of bargain” - put you in as good a position as you would have been had K been fully performed as promised/bargained for
     * Protects π’s net expectation: includes incidental + consequential damage
     * Non-conforming goods? Difference between value of goods promised and those delivered
     * For total breach: also include cost avoided + loss avoided
  1. Reliance – restoration to the position you would have been in if the K had never been made (compensates for loss arising out of reliance on K)
     * Larger than expectation damages if you made a bad deal (where one would sustain a loss even if the K had been performed)
  1. Restitution – take back from D what was given and kept unjustly

## Computing the Value of Expectation Values

* Components of Calculation
  * Loss in value: value of what should have been received - value of what was actually received
  * Other loss: consequential + incidental damages
    * Consequential damages include injury to person or proerty caused by the breach
    * Incidental damages include additional costs incurred after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid loss (costs of trying to mitigate)
  * Cost avoided: Savings from avoiding expenditure that would have been incurred if no breach
  * Loss avoided: Loss avoided by the salvage/reallocation of resources devoted to original contract
* Expectation damages for total breach

  ```general measure = loss in value - other loss - loss avoided - cost avoided```

* Expectation damages for partial breach

  ```general measure = loss in value - other loss```

* Peevyhouse Rule
  * Where provision breached was merely incidental to contract's main purpose and where the economic benefit which P would receive from completing performance is grossly disproportionate to cost of completion, damages are limited to the difference/diminution in value resulting because of non-performance.
  * Most courts vary from this rule, but it is still valid law in OK
* Restatement (Second)
  * § 344 – Allows expectation damages, among others, which it defines as interest in having the benefit of the bargain by being put in as good a position as he would have had K been performed
  * § 347 – Injured party has right to damages based on his expectation interest as measured by
    1. Loss in value to him by other party's deficiency
    1. Any other loss, including incidental and consequential, caused by breach
    1. Cost or other loss avoided by not having to perform
  * § 348 – Alt. to Loss in Value of Performance
    1. If breach delays use of property and loss is not recoverable with reasonable certainty, may use rental value or interest as proxy
    2. If only part performance may get damages on (1) loss of market value caused by breach or (2) cost of completion, if not disproportionate to loss in value
    3. If based on condition of fortuitous event, may get value of conditional right
* UCC
  * § 2-706 Seller's Resale Including Contract for Resale
    * Seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is reasonable and made in good faith, the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages, but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach
  * § 2-708 Seller's Damages for Non-acceptance or Repudiation.
    * Measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided
  * § 2-709 Action for the Price
    * When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due, seller may recover,along with incidental damages, the price:  
    1. of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and
    1. of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.
  * § 2-710 Seller’s Incidental Damages
    * Any commercially reasonable expenses incurred in stopping delivery, in the transport, care and custody of goods after the buyer’s breach, in connection w/ return resale of the goods or otherwise resulting from the breach
  * 2-715 Buyer’s Incidental + Consequential Damages
    * Incidental: any expenses reasonably incurred in connection with handling rightfully inspection rightfully rejected goods, or in connection w/ effecting cover (if commercially reasonable), any other reasonable expense incident to the breach.

### *Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co.*

D, a mining company, contracts to stripe mine on P's farmland. As part of the agreement, D promised to restore land following its use. However, once mining is complete, D fails to make restorations. D argues the remedial work would be extremely costly and would only provide a very small benefit to P. TC awards P $29k that is needed to complete remedial work. Court holds that since the remedial work was **only incidental to the contract's main purpose and cost of completion disproportionate to its benefit, P should be compensated for the diminution in value due to non-performance, not the cost of completion.** Thus, court rules damages should be $300, not $29K.

### *Crabby’s Inc. v. Hamilton*

D executed a contract to purchase restaurant owned by P for $290k. P assigned his interest in the contract to an L.L.C. established to operate new restaurant. Contract has provision to use reasonable diligence in obtaining a loan and provide written loan commitment within 30 days or the contract terminated automatically. D gets loan but never submits written loan commitment to P. Following 30 day period, P takes steps showing its intent to proceed with transaction. D backs out 2 days before closing date, as it found a better deal. P didn't sell the restaurant until nearly 12 months later for $235,000. P files suit, claiming damages for difference between contract price and eventual sale price. TC awards in favor of P and D appeals, arguing no breach because contract automatically terminated. Court holds contract not terminated because conduct of both parties following 30 day window shows intent to proceed with contract (i.e. contingency clause is waived). **Damages should thus be difference between contract price and fair market value.** Using eventual sales price as proxy, P should be awarded $55k in loss of value, plus $40k in other loss, for a total of $95k in damages.

### *Handicapped Children’s Ed. Board v. Lukaszewski*

P, a school, hired D as employee for 2 year contract. D commutes 45 minutes to job and attempts to leave for something close by. P won't allow her to resign. D eventually resigns, citing health issues caused by situation. P attempts to find replacement and hires only candidate, whom has qualifications which command higher salary than D. P brings suit claiming damages for the additional expense of paying D's replacement. Court holds that **damages for breach of an employment contract include the cost of obtaining other services equivalent to that promised but not performed, plus any foreseeable consequential damages.** P attempted to mitigate loss by hiring the least expensive qualified replacement available and acted reasonably. Thus, in order to put P in position for which it bargained, it should be awarded difference between salaries.

## Restrictions on Expectation Damages: Foreseeability, Certainty, and Causation

* General Damages
  * Loss resulting from breach that is foreseeable as probable (or natural) result of the breach
    * "Natural" in the sense that it accords with common experience of ordinary persons
  * Need not make special showing
* Consequential Damages
  * Loss that results in the non-ordinary course of events, must be forseeable 
  * Also apply to any damage to property/persons caused by failure to conform to contractual warranties
* R2d § 351 - Unforseeability + Related Limitations on Damages
  * Not liable for loss that the party in breach did not have reason to foresee as a probable result of breach when the K was made. Foreseeable = in the ordinary course of things (general/direct) OR as a result of special circumstances that the breaching party had reason to know (consequential/special).
    * Court may limit damages for foreseeable loss if justice so requires to avoid disproportionate compensation (e.g. excluding lost profits, limiting to reliance, etc.)
* R2d § 352 - Uncertainty as a Limitation on Damages
  * Damages not recoverable for loss beyond amount that evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty
* UCC § 2-710. Seller’s Incidental Damages
  * Any commercially reasonable expenses incurred in stopping delivery, in the transport, care and custody of goods after the buyer’s breach, in connection w/ return resale of the goods or otherwise resulting from the breach.
* UCC § 2-715 Buyer’s Incidental + Consequential Damages
  * Incidental: any expenses reasonably incurred in connection with handling rightfully inspection rightfully rejected goods, or in connection w/ effecting cover (if commercially reasonable), any other reasonable expense incident to the breach.
  * Consequential: any loss resulting from general or particular requirements which seller at time of contracting had reason to know and which could not be reasonably prevented by cover or otherwise (*Hadley* rule for lost profits); and
    * Injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty (not proximate if buyer unreasonably failed to inspect good) (not subject to foreseeability test)
    * Particular needs of the buyer must be made known to the seller)

### *Hadley v. Baxendale*

Crank shaft in a mill owned by P broke, causing entire milling operation to shut down. P sends employee to office of D, a carrier service, who informs D that new shaft must be sent immediately. D's clerk seems to provide assurance that it will be delivered hastily. Delivery was delayed due some neglect on behalf of D. P's mill remained shut down during this time, thus causing lost profits for which P sues. D objects to this, claiming lost profit damages were too remote. **Court rules that extent of damages should be limited to (1) those arising naturally from breach (directness) or (2) those that could be reasonably contemplated by parties at time of contract (foreseeability)**. However, if circumstances were unknown to D (i.e. no awareness of mill's shutdown), he can only be liable for damages that would arise generally (i.e. in the majority of such cases under ordinary circumstances). Court rules that the special circumstances were not communicated to D and that in great multitude of cases with ordinary circumstances, such consequences would not arise naturally. Hence, D not held liable for the consequential damages.

### *Florafax International, Inc. v. GTE Market Resources, Inc.*

Floral products marketer enters agreement with P, a floral clearinghouse, whereby P will handle direct consumer orders and place corresponding outbound orders. Contract was initially for 1 year w/ a month-to-month renewal thereafter and termination rights with 60 days notice, terminable at any time. P subcontracts D to provide telecom services for 2 years. D was aware of P's contract and knew it would be challenged by the volume of calls, but accepted the work despite questions around its profitability. D ultimately unable to handle the volume and evidence that they made little attempt to increase its capacity. As result of D's poor performance, floral marketer terminates agreement with P. P terminates its agreement with D and is forced to assume D's responsibilities. P filed suit against D seeking to recover lost profits from other contract and other damages. Court awards incidental damages incurred by P in setting up own call center to assume D's responsibilities following the breach. Court holds that if there was reason
