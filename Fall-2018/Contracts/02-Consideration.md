# Chapter 2 - Section B: Consideration

## Consideration

* "Bargained-for-exchange" theory:
  * Definition of consideration in which there is reciprocal inducement of a party's detriment by the other party's promise. Holmesian test of "reciprocal conventional inducement, each for the other" is commonly employed by courts.
  * If a promise is made (i.e. detriment to the promisor) and the promiser has no real interest in the detriment incurred by the offeree in exchange, the promisee's detriment is simply incidental or conditional to their receipt of the benefit, not consideration
  * \*\*Actual\*\* negotiation between parties isn't necessarily required
  * Reflected in R2d ยง 71
* "Benefit/Detriment" theory:
  * Consideration is defined in terms of benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee (See *Hamer*)
  * Has deep roots in Anglo-American common law and has largely been replaced by the bargained-for-exchange theory
* Contractual disputes on the basis of insufficient consideration are rare.
  * They are of much greater academic/intellectual significance than practical.
  * If they do arise, it is typically in the context of contract modifications, options contracts, or family agreements
  * Hence, differences in the two theories about seem to be marginal since nearly every contract will satisfy both with the exception of some family promises or edge cases that may go unenforced under the bargain theory
* Illusory Promise: a promise that appears on its face to be so insubstantial as to impose no obligation on the promisor. Promisor is not bound to anything - performance is optional

### Rules - Consideration

* **R2d ยง 71 - Consideration**
  * To constitute consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for
  * A performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promise in exchange for that promise
  * The performance may consist of:
    * an act other than a promise, or
    * a forbearance, or
    * the creation, modification, or destruction of a legal relation
  * The performance or return promise may be given to the promisor or to some other person. It may be given by the promisee or by some other person
* **R2d ยง 79 - Adequacy of Consideration; Mutuality of Obligation**
  * If the requirement of consideration is met, there is no additional requirement of:
    * Benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee; or
    * Equivalence in the values exchanged

### *Hamer v. Sidway*

Uncle promises nephew $5000 if he refrains from smoking, drinking, gambling, and cursing until he is 21. Nephew turns 21 and Uncle informs him that he intends to give him, but will hold it $5000 on interest. Uncle dies without paying anything and nephew sues for breach of contract. Estate contends there was insufficient consideration. Court acknowledges definition of consideration which consists of any right/profit/interest/benefit accrued to a party **or** some forbearance/detriment/loss/responsiblity undertaken by the other party. Court does not consider whether the consideration is of any substantial value, simply that it is promised or done by a party in exchange for the promise made to him. Abandoning a legal right or freedom of action in exchange for a a promise is meets this definition. Thus, the court rules that the nephew placing a limitation on his freedom of action (i.e. drinking, smoking, etc.) upon faith of the uncle's promise is sufficient consideration, whether or not it was of any legal benefit to the uncle.

### *Pennsy Supply, Inc. v. American Ash Recycling Corp.*

Paving subcontractor brought breach of contract/warranty action against defendant, seeking to recover costs it had incurred because of defective aggregate that it obtained from recycling company. Defendant offered aggregate for free though never indicated that it was defective. Trial court dismisses claim for lack of consideration in contract formation. Court cites "Bargained-for-exchange" theory in which the detriment incurred must be the "quid prop quo" of the promise and the inducement for which it was made. In the agreement, the relationship between the consideration and the promise was one of reciprocal inducement. The court determines that these elements were present. The avoidance of the disposal cost induced the defendant to offer the aggregate for free. Likewise, the promise of the aggregate induced the plaintiff to incur the cost of collecting and taking ownership of the aggregate.

### *Dougherty v. Salt*

An aunt issues a promissory note for $3,000, payable at her death, to her 8 year old nephew for being a "nice boy". Aunt dies and the boy's guardian brings action against executrix of her will. Appellate court reverses trial courts dismissal, holding that the note was sufficient evidence of consideration. Court held that the note was a voluntary and unenforceable promise of an executory gift. The promise was neither accepted or offered for any other purpose, nor was not conditional on anything other than the aunt's death.

### *Marshall Durbin Food corp. v. Baker*

In attempt to retain executives from leaving the company due to uncertainty about the future of the company, majority owner enters into agreement with plaintiff. The agreement provides entitlement to termination/early retirement compensation triggered by specific conditions, so long as he maintains his employment at will. Among these conditions was death or incapacitation of the majority owner. The majority owner falls terminally ill and is declared incapacitated. Plaintiff announces his resignation, but the board of directors claim the agreement was not valid and voted to repudiate it. Plaintiff sues for breach and company asserts lack of consideration as an affirmative defense. Trial court rules in favor of plaintiff and defendant appeals. Court rejects defendants claim that plaintiff provided no consideration since he was not bound to a promise to refrain from seeking employment. The plaintiff offered consideration by continuing his employment until condition was triggered, which is the acceptance of a unilateral contract. The court found the plaintiff's detriment of continued employment to be a benefit to the company during a period instability. Hence, there was consideration for the contract.
