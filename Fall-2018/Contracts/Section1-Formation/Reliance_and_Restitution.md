# Liability in the Absence of Bargained-for-Exchange

## Promissory Estoppel in Commercial Contexts

### *Katz v. Danny Dare, Inc.*

Not a contract because Katz incurred no legal detriment, as he had no unconditional right to remain employed.

**Facts**:
D offers P to pay an annuity in exchange for his early retirement. P acquiesces and eventually starts working part-time at another business. D ceases payments and is sued. Trial court rules in favor of D, reasoning agreement wasn't enforceable because P didn't have to do anything/give up any legal right and the alternative was termination.

**Ruling**:
In order for the doctrine of promissory estoppel to apply, there must be:

1. A promise
2. Detrimental reliance on that promise
3. Only way to avoid injustice is to enforce the promise

Court finds that there was clear and definite promise. It also determined that P voluntarily gave up earnings to his own detriment in exchange for the promise. It can't be said that termination was P's only alternative, as it was clear D was taking every measure to avoid doing so. Finally, court held corrective justice was necessary as there is other way for P to recover lost earnings in reliance on D's promise. Hence, the court reverses trial court's decision.

### *Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A.*

**Look at notes on pg. 248**

**Facts**:
P defaults on mortgage and files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. D, who purchased mortgage, promises to work with P on reinstatement/loan modification if P files for less protective Chapter 13 bankruptcy. D forecloses and doesn't attempt to co-operate until after the home was auctioned. P brings action seeking relief for promissory estoppel, among other claims.

**Ruling**:
Court identifies requirements for promissory estoppel claim as:

1. A promise on clear and unambiguous terms
2. Reliance by promisee
3. Expectation of reliance must be reasonable and forseeable by promisor
4. Promisee was injured by reliance

The court determined that D's promise was unambiguous: it wouldn't foreclose without first engaging it negotiations. Additionally, the court held that D should have foreseen P's reliance on the promise because it was offered for the sole purpose of inducing P to file Chapter 13, which it did. Finally, P's reliance on the promise resulted in several rights and protections under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be surrendered and this ultimately allowed D to foreclose. Thus, the court determined P stated a claim for promissory estoppel.

## Unjust Enrichment and Restitution

* Two central elements of restitutionary recovery:
  1. Enrichment of one person - Some sort of benefit conferred upon an individual unofficiously
  1. Circumstances where the retention of benefits would be unjust to another person
* Restatement (Third) on Restitution:
  > **ยง1**
  > A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is subject to liability in restitution.
* Contract implied in law
  * An obligation imposed by law, regardless of either parties assent, applied as a legal fiction to remedy unjust enrichment
  * Commonly referred to as a quasi-contract, though restitution and unjust enrichment don't always arise in contractual contexts
  * Unlike true contracts, they do not arise under the traditional bargaining process and are not subject to the same rules
* Contract implied in fact
  * Distinct from restitutionary claim insofar as the party receiving the benefit requested it
  * Law infers a bargain to pay
  * Like express contracts, contracts implied in fact are real contracts

### [*Credit Bureau Enterprises, Inc. v. Pelo*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I23931ca4ff3a11d99439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

**Facts**:
D involuntarily hospitalized and refuses to provide compensation for hospitalization because it was both unnecessary and agreed to under duress. Hospital assigns claim to P for collection. P ultimately unsuccessfully sought judgement in small claims court and appealed. Decision was reversed and D appealed.

**Ruling**:
Court references Restatement of Restitution ยง116 which asserts a person who has supplied services to another, despite acting without the other's consent, is entitled to restitution if the services were necessary to prevent the other from suffering serious harm. Facts surrounding D's hospitalization demonstrate that it was necessary at the time. Thus, D's refusal to assent to an express contract is irrelevant because he is legally obligated to pay for his services under an implied contract in law.

### [*Watts v. Watts*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I5bd754e9feb311d983e7e9deff98dc6f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

**Facts**:
P and D ended a nonmarital cohabitatation relationship. P brought action claiming that she was entitled to equitable division of the couple's assets. Lower courts dismiss P's case for failure to state a claim.

**Ruling**:
Court ultimately determines that P is able to a claim on two separate theories of recovery. The first of these theories is that P quit her job and career training in reliance on D's promise to support the family. The court holds that a change in one's circumstances in performance of an agreement seems to suggest there was indeed an agreement. Further, other courts have recognized domestic contributions as adequate consideration in an agreement to share property. Hence, the court rules D has pleaded the facts necessary to state a claim for breach of contract. The second theory of recovery was based onf D's acceptance and retention of P's services (both domestic and financial) with full knowledge of P's expectation of sharing wealth accumulated during their relationship. Court holds that to recover for unjust enrichment, P must show that a benefit was conferred on D, knowledge/appreciation of the benefit by D, and acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances making it unequitable to do so. Court determines P is able to demonstrate all of these elements and is therefore able to state a claim.

## Promissory Restitution

* Bears similarity to both classical contracts and pure restitution
  * Like classical contract insofar as the obligation rests on the assent of the promisor
  * Like pure restitution insofar as no bargain-for-exchange has taken place
* Material Benefit Rule
  * There is sufficient consideration in promise to pay for past services if promisee confers a material benefit upon the promisor, hence these type of promises are enforceable
  * Ratification theory - Promise to pay for material benefit accrued in the past can viewed as a ratification and therefore an implied invitation of this benefit
  * Restatement (Second) ยง86 asserts a variant of this rule. A binding promise must rest on an actual benefit, as opposed to pure gratitude or sentiment
  * Not accepted by all courts
* Classic View
  * Moral obligation is not sufficient consideration by itself. The only exception is in cases where some obligation had previously existed but has since become unenforceable (e.g. due to passage of time)
  * While an individual may be bound by moral conscience to recompense for past services rendered, they are not bound by law
* Difference from pure restitution
  * Promissory restitution does not do much more than pure restitution, but such differences occur at the margins

### [*Mills v. Wyman*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I0ad6af71cf2d11d99439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

**Facts**:
Son of D returns from voyage at sea gravely ill and is too poor to seek care. P gives provides him with shelter and comfort until he died. D writes letter to P showing gratitude for the care provided and promises to recompense for any expenses that had been incurred. D breaks promise and P subsequently brings action to recover.

**Ruling**:
Court identifies the general rule which maintains promises offered without consideration cannot be enforced, regardless of the moral implications. While acknowledging that some courts have recognized a moral obligation as sufficient consideration to a promise, the court asserts that this rule is to be limited to cases where some other consideration had previously existed. The services provided by P occurred before any promise was made and were not a benefit to D (in the legal sense). Thus, the court held that while D may be bound by conscience, he is not bound by law.

### [*Webb v. McGowin*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibb4d84e208db11d99e26e917ec01b803/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

**Facts**:
P falls off of mill and is severely injured while attempting to prevent it from falling on top of D. P's injuries render him physically unable to work and D promises to pay $15/week out of gratitude for saving his life. D kept promise and made payments for 8 years until his death. P bringing action against D's estate for refusing to continue payments.

**Ruling**:
The court applies rule where there is sufficient consideration in promise to pay for past services if promisee confers a *material benefit* upon the promisor. It also acknowledges the rule applied in *Mills v. Wyman* where for a moral obligation to constitute consideration there must have existed some prior legal obligation. However, it identifies qualification to this rule in cases where a material benefit is conferred. In such cases, subsequent promise to pay is a *ratification* of the benefit provided, suggesting a previous request/invitation for the benefit was implied. Saving D from serious bodily harm is a material benefit and it was provided to P's detriment. Hence, the court ruled that the agreement is enforceable.
