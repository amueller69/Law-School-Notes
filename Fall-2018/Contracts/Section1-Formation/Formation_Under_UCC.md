# Chapter 2 - Section C: Contract Formation Under UCC Article 2

* **UCC**: Uniform law proposal, seeking to govern the sale of goods, that must be enacted by a state legislature to take effect. Preexisting principles of common law supplement the UCC unless they conflict.
  * Has been adopted either partially or in whole by every state
  * Applies to both consumer and commercial goods
  * Goods generally defined as moveable property. IP, real estate, leases, and services are not goods
* Predominant Purpose Test:
  * Used to determine if transaction falls under scope of UCC Article to if it is for a mix of goods and other forms of property/services
  * It does this by attempting to ascertain the primary purpose of the transaction
* Formation under the UCC
  * More liberal approach to indefiniteness of terms than the common law, emphasizing the parties intent to be bound even if some terms are left open.
  * ยง 2-204. Formation in General
    > 1. A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract
    > 2. An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined
    > 3. Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy

## Mutual Assent Under the UCC

### [Jannusch v. Naffziger](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ib55a20f6e6c911dcb595a478de34cd72/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

**Facts**:
Defendant purchases food truck business, including the truck itself, from plaintiffs. While having paid $10,000 for the right to purchase the business but not signing a formal contract, defendant takes ownership and begins operating the business. After the income was lower than expected, defendant tries to return food truck.

**Ruling**:
Court rules that UCC should govern this transaction after applying the predominant purpose test, as it was predominantly for the food truck and not the intangible components of the business. While defendants contend no contract existed due to incompleteness of terms, court found that the essential terms of the contract had been defined as required for enforcement under UCC. Additionally, the parties' conduct, by transferring the goods, clearly show the sale has taken place. That the signing of a formal written contract was still outstanding does not make the agreement unenforceable under certain conditions. Hence, returning the truck was breach of contract.
