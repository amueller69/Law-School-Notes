# Ray v. William G. Eurice & Bros.
### 201 Md. 115, 93 A.2d 272 (1952)
----

### **Facts**:
* Owners (P) entered a contract with builders (D) for the construction of a home.
* Builders submit 3 page building specifications. Plaintiff informs builder that he will have lawyer draw up separate contract.
* The new contract references a separate 5 page specification document that is dated the same as the 3 page specs.
* Builders sign the contract and subsequently refuse to perform after realizing the specs referenced in the contract were not the ones they submitted.

### **Procedural History**: 
Circuit court entered judgement in favor of the defendant on grounds that there was no "meeting of the minds" between parties, citing differences in intended meaning of an integral term.

### **Issue(s)**:
Can a party avoid performance of a written contract when the terms the party intended are materially different than those expressed in the contract?


### **Holding**:
The builders cannot avoid performance of the contract due differences in the clearly expressed terms of the contract and those it intended to be bound to.

### **Disposition**:
Reversed.

### **Rule(s) Applied**:
Absent fraud, duress or mutual mistake, one having the capacity to understand a written document who reads and signs it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature in law.

### **Reasoning**:
It is clear that there was no fraud or duress present in the formation of the contract. If there was a mistake, it was a unilateral one made by the defendants, as the plaintiff's intend meaning of the terms is the same as expressed in the contract.
