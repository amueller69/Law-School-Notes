# Manifestation of Mutual Assent

## **Ray v. William G. Eurice & Bros.**

**Citation**: *201 Md. 115, 93 A.2d 272 (1952)*

 **Facts**:
* Owners (P) entered a contract with builders (D) for the construction of a home.
* Builders submit 3 page building specifications. Plaintiff informs builder that he will have lawyer draw up separate contract.
* The new contract references a separate 5 page specification document that is dated the same as the 3 page specs.
* Builders sign the contract and subsequently refuse to perform after realizing the specs referenced in the contract were not the ones they submitted.

**Procedural History**:
Circuit court entered judgement in favor of the defendant on grounds that there was no "meeting of the minds" between parties, citing differences in intended meaning of an integral term.

**Issue(s)**:
Can a party avoid performance of a written contract when the terms the party intended are materially different than those expressed in the contract?

**Holding**:
The builders cannot avoid performance of the contract due differences in the clearly expressed terms of the contract and those it intended to be bound to.

**Disposition**:
Reversed.

**Rule(s) Applied**:
Absent fraud, duress or mutual mistake, one having the capacity to understand a written document who reads and signs it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature in law.

**Reasoning**:
It is clear that there was no fraud or duress present in the formation of the contract. If there was a mistake, it was a unilateral one made by the defendants, as the plaintiff's intend meaning of the terms is the same as expressed in the contract.

# Offer and Acceptance - Bilateral Contracts

## **Lonergan v Scolnick**

**Facts**:
Plaintiff alleges he agreed to purchase land from defendant after making inquiry via mail. Defendant responded with letter providing a "rock-bottom" price instructing the plaintiff to act fast, as a potential buyer is likely in the coming days. Plaintiff interpreted this as an offer to purchase land at the minimum price and opened an escrow. However, the defendant had already sold the land to a third party by the time the plaintiff received the letter and "accepted the offer".

**Ruling**:
The Court held there was no contract formed between the parties because a definite offer was never made. In its decision, it cited both the Restatement on Contracts:
> If from a promise, or manifestation of attention, or from the circumstances existing at   the time, the person to whom the promise or manifestation is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend it as an expression of his fixed purpose until he has given a further expression of assent, he has not made an offer

and another case within the jurisdiction in which the negotiation between parties was deemed to be purely preliminary. The plaintiff had reason to know that the communication was not intended as "an expression of fixed purpose to make a definite offer" which requires no further assent on behalf of the offeror. The letter sent by the plaintiff may be viewed as an invitation to make an offer, but not an offer in and of itself.

## **Izadi v. Machado Ford, Inc.**

**Facts**:
A car dealership (D) ran a print advertisement for a trade-in promotion. The promotion allowed for a minimum trade-in allowance of $3000 with the purchase of **a** new Ford. However, this offer was qualified by a provision in small print that limited the application of the allowance to two specific models that were not mentioned anywhere else in the advertisement. The plaintiff interpreted the offer as applicable to any model Ford and brought and action for breach of contract and fraud when the dealer wouldn't recognize this interpretation.

**Ruling**:
The Court found that an objective interpretation of the advertisement, as it would be perceived by a reasonable person, would be the same as the plaintiff's: an unqualified offer for a $3000 trade-in allowance with the purchase of **any** new Ford. This runs contrary to the traditional rule that advertisements are merely invitations for offers unless they "invite acceptance without further negotiation in clear, definite, express, and unconditional language. Additionally, the Court found that the advertisement deliberately sought to make the public believe that an offer similar to the plaintiff's interpretation exists. It appealed to reasoning in which courts have an interest, on public policy grounds, on upholding offers that sellers had intended to be deceptive.

## **Normile v. Miller**

**Facts**:
Plaintiffs make an offer on a home with a time-for-acceptance provision. The realtor, with whom the defendant has listed the property for sale, modifies several terms of the offer and returns it. The plaintiffs do not immediately accept the new terms and the property is eventually sold to another party. When the plaintiffs are informed that the property was sold, they promptly accept the new terms and make a deposit. Plaintiff's seek specific performance on the grounds that they accepted a valid offer.

**Ruling:**
The Court held the realtor never expressed any assent to the original terms of the contract and the "conditional acceptance" and modification effectively serve as a rejection of the original offer and a counter-proposal. The counteroffer did not include the time-for-acceptance provision of the original offer, so there was no promise made to the plaintiffs to hold the offer open for a period of time. The defendant reserved the right to revoke the offer so long as it provides notice to the offeree, which it did. Thus, there was no valid offer for the plaintiffs to accept and no contract between the parties was ever formed.

## Comments on Offer and Acceptance - Bilateral Contracts

* **Offer**: A manifestation of willingness to enter an agreement under defined terms.
* **Bilateral Contract**: Term of art referring to a contract formed by the mutual exchange of promises.
* Two rules for interpreting contractual offer that appeared in the cases above:
  1. Interpretation of an offer or acceptance is not what the party making it intended to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of that party would have thought it to mean.
  2. What can be interpreted as a definite offer should not require additional communication or expression of assent on behalf of the offerer. This is what distinguishes and offer from an invitation to make an offer.

* Classic Principles of Offer and Acceptance
  1. Power of acceptance created by an offer is terminated by by the offeree's rejection, the offeror's revocation, or death/incapacitation - 2nd Restatement Sec. 36
  1. A "qualified" or "conditional" acceptance constitutes only a counteroffer (*proposing a substituted bargain*) and is the functional equivalent of a rejection of the original contract as it applies to power of acceptance - 2nd Restatement sec. 39 & 59
  1. Common law generally provides that an offer is freely revocable at any time prior to acceptance, terminating power of acceptance, so long as notice is provided to the offeree and there is no pre-existing promise to leave offer open. Promise not to revoke over fixed period of time -- an *option* -- must be supported by consideration.

# Offer and Acceptance - Unilateral Contracts

## Cook v. Coldwell Banker

**Facts**:  
Real Estate firm (D) orally announced incentive program awarding end-of-year bonuses to agents that surpassed various sales milestones. Towards the end of the year, the defendant announced a modification to the program in which bonuses would not be paid until the following spring. Plaintiff, whom qualified for highest bonus percentage on the commission-based scale, had planned to stay with firm throughout the entire year so as to receive the bonus. The plaintiff departed from the firm after the end of the bonus cycle but prior to the awarding of bonuses. The defendant refused to pay out the bonus, resulting in the plaintiff bringing an action for breach of contract. Trial court awarded judgement in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant appealed on the grounds that the plaintiff neither provided sufficient consideration nor an acceptance to the bonus offer and that it was free to revoke.

**Ruling**:
The court determined that the defendant's offer constituted a unilateral contract offer in which it would pay a bonus in exchange for continued at-will employment. The plaintiff's continued employment, which was induced by the promise of a bonus, serves as both consideration and acceptance in this unilateral contract. The court cited a general rule of contract law which states unilateral offers may not be revoked when *substantial performance* necessary to accept the offer has been rendered. The court found the plaintiffs continued employment, induced by the promise of a bonus, constituted substantial performance. In this light, the defendant had no right to revoke the offer and its failure to render performance of its promise is a breach of contract.

## Sateriale v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.

**Facts**:
Tobacco company (D) operates customer loyalty program which issues certificates with the purchase of its products which can be saved and redeemed for merchandise. This program is frequently advertised and runs for nearly two decades before the defendant abruptly announces its retirement. All customers enrolled in the program are notified 6 months before the planned deprecation date. However, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants stopped acknowledging the program immediately after the notice was provided. The plaintiff's, stuck with thousands of the rewards certificates that they have unsuccessfully attempted to redeem, file a class action complaint for breach of contract.

**Ruling**:
The court does not accept the tobacco company's defense that no valid offer existed since the advertisements are typically interpreted in the eyes of the law as merely invitations to make offers. The court states the rule for an advertisement constituting a valid offer requires that the advertiser promise, in clear terms, to render performance in exchange for something requested and the recipient of the advertisement would reasonably conclude that rendering the requested performance would result in a contract. The plaintiffs allege that the promise of the defendant in the unilateral contract was to make certain merchandise redeemable throughout the program's lifespan, which the court determines was a promise the defendant clearly breached by not redeeming certificates in the programs final six months.

## Comments on Offer and Acceptance in Unilateral Contracts

* A unilateral contract can be viewed as a way for offerors to insulate themselves from the risk of non-performance. However, to remedy this potential imbalance, the court has adopted certain ways of protecting offerees whom must first render performance in order for the offeror to be bound to its promise
* A unilateral offer generally includes an implied *subsidiary promise* not to revoke in exchange for initiation of the invited performance. In beginning to render performance, offeree is providing both manifestation of assent and consideration for this option contract.
* In these option contracts, the offeree is generally not bound to complete the performance. However, beginning to render performance may constitute as a promise to complete it if there is justifiable reliance.

# Definiteness and Postponed Bargaining

## [Walker v. Keith](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/IE4D976FCA6D711DEB08DE1B7506AD85B/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw: Walker v. Keith")

**Facts**:

**Ruling**:


## Comments on Offer and Acceptance in Unilateral Contracts

* Reasons for the Indefiniteness of Terms
  1. Parties don't realize they hold different understandings about unaddressed terms
  2. Costs of continued bargaining might not be justified
  3. A party believes that a dispute over unaddressed terms would result in their favor, either as a matter of law or due to bargaining leverage
  4. Parties may have agreed to designate certain terms for postponement
     * *Ambiguity promotes agreement* - If a dispute over a term would prevent an agreement, postponing these terms may lead to a contract that wouldn't have otherwise been formed.
