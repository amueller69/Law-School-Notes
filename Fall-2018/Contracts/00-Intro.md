# Introduction to Contract Law: The Basics

* What is a contract?
  * A contract is a promise that the law recognizes as a duty or for which the law provides a remedy
  * A contract is a legally recognized promise/obligation
* Where do we find contract law?
  * Rules of Contract
    * Embodied in the law, general default rules of contract law that may be contracted around
  * Restatements (Second) of Contracts – R2d
    * This is only PERSUASIVE authority
    * Embodies much of the common law of the states, but is neither exclusive nor pervasive in scope
  * Uniform Commercial Code – UCC
    * This is MANDATORY, STATE authority but only is PERSUASIVE authority at the FEDERAL level
  * Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)
    * This is MANDATORY, FEDERAL authority
    * This is a treaty between countries that governs only INTERNATIONAL, COMMERCIAL sales between MERCHANTS
* What is the purpose of contract law?
  * To help settle disputes between parties which have entered into legal obligations w/ undefined terms
  * To reinforce extralegal factors like reputation, moral principles, and reciprocity which usually force us to honor contract obligations
  * Helps to make contractual negotiations more efficient b/c there is no need to bargain over every, single term
  * To facilitate the building of social value

## UCC

* Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a uniform body of laws governing commercial dealings
  * Has been adopted by all 50 states
    * Despite some slight variations, we will assume pure uniformity across all jurisdictions in the course
* Article 2 governs sales of goods
  * Goods are all things that are moveable at time of agreement
  * Does not apply to real estate transactions, contracts for services, contracts for intellectual property (patents, trademarks), or contracts to lease goods, what about insurance?
  * DOES apply to contracts between merchants + consumers, merchants + merchants, and consumer-consumer sale of goods (buying a bike from owner at a yard sale)
* Does NOT supplant consumer protection statutes
* It does not displace common law unless in particular conflict (§ 1-103). In essence, common law fills in the gaps that the UCC does not cover
* Parties may, subject to some limitations, vary the provisions of the UCC by agreement
  * Exceptions: good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care

## CISG

* UN Convention on International Sale of Goods (CISG) is a treaty that, having been ratified by 87 countries, acts uniform international sales law
  * In United States, can be treated as federal law that is a supreme law of the land
  * Applies when parties to a contract have places of business in states signatory to the treaty
  * If a party has multiple places of business, the place of business that has the ‘closest relationship to the contract and its performance’ controls
    * A contract between a U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese company + a U.S. company would NOT be subject to the CISG
  * Most U.S. trading partners (NOT the UK) are parties to the CISG
* Applies to sale of goods, similar to the UCC’s Article 2
  * Where sale of goods takes place between business in U.S., UCC applies
  * Does not apply to liability of seller for death/personal injury caused by goods, UCC does
* Designed to govern sale of goods for commercial uses
  * Does not apply to consumer transactions, UCC does
  * Does not apply to sale of goods for personal use (household items)
  * Does not apply to contracts where the predominant part of the sale involves services, or to contracts involving real estate
* Parties may by contract agree that CISG does not apply at all
