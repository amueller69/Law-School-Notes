# Alternatives to Expectation Damages

## Reliance Damages

* Party can recover reliance damages for breach even if they can’t prove expectation damages with reasonable certainty
* A party may not recover money spent in reliance on the contract if it can be proven that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for the injured party
  * An award for reliance on the contract must reflect any loss that the injured party would have suffered had the contract been fully performed (subtracted from reliance damages)
  * Embodies principle that a party shouldn't be able to escape bad bargain through reliance damages
* An award of damages will not be reduced due to an injured party’s failure to mitigate when the facts are clear that both parties had the same opportunity to mitigate
* Promissory Estoppel Contexts
  * Judges have discretion to limit remedy as justice requires
    * May limit relief to damages measured by extent of reliance (i.e. out-of-pocket expenses) instead of full expectation damages
    * Majority of jurisdictions have adopted this approach
  * Some courts hold that relief P.E. cases should ALWAYS be measured by actual reliance

### Rules

* **R2d § 349 - Reliance Damages**
  * As an alternative to expectation damages, the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest, including expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance, minus any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed (burden on D to show that the K would have been a losing one)

### *Wartzman v. Hightower Productions, Ltd.*

P establishes and capitalizes new corporation to finance attempt to break world record. D hired as law firm and provides guidance, though fails to comply with securities regulations and informs P that securities specialist needs to be hired to straighten things out. P can't afford it and D refuses to pay. Record breaking attempt indefinitely postponed. P brings suit. **If expectation damage for lost profits can’t be shown w/ reasonable certainty (i.e. too speculative) money spent in part performance, in preparation for, or in reliance on the K are recoverable**.  Court holds P was injured due to its reliance on the contract; it sold stock and incurred substantial obligations in reliance on the contract. Additionally, **if D can establish that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for P, then reliance damages can be limited or excluded altogether**. D was unable to establish that P would have suffered a net loss from its venture, so this exception is not applicable here. Court also found that P did not fail duty to mitigate as suggested by P. P lacked the funds necessary to hire a securities specialist, **a substantial obligation that P is not required to incur in order to mitigate**. Further, D had the same opportunity to mitigate and refused to do so. Thus, court holds P should be permitted to recover reliance damages.

### *Walser v. Toyota*

P initiates process to become dealer of cars sold by D. Three step process: Application, letter of intent containing conditions, and then formal agreement. P completes first step and D informs them that letter of intent approved and "they were [their] dealer". D later informs them that this was a mistake and letter had not been approved. P had already purchased facility for dealership. P files suit seeking full relief (including lost profits) under theories of breach and promissory estoppel. TC awards relief on promissory estoppel grounds, but limits damage to out of pocket expenditures, which was **price paid minus FMV**. P appeals. CoA points to Restatements description of remedies available in promissory estoppel cases, providing that, **where appropriate, relief may be limited to that measured by the extent of P's reliance rather than the terms of the contract. Thus, this places the damages decision within the trial judge’s discretion**. Here, D provided evidence showing that a formal dealership agreement was far from certain while P did not demonstrated any opportunity lost by virtue of relying on the promise. CoA asserts that it won't interfere with lower court discretionary decisions so long as it "remains within the range of choice" (it did), accounts for all relevant factors (it did), and does not constitute a clear error judgement (it doesn't). Thus, CoA affirms TC's judgement

## Restitutionary Damages

* Based on concept of unjust enrichment, so breaching party may still claim in restitution
  * This may create perverse incentives
* Restitution damages sometimes put a party in a better place than expectation damages, causing commentators to disagree over this doctrine
  * Justified because party may get good deal, if they breach, court should be able to take away that good deal and give fair market value of services

### Rules - Restitutionary Damages

* **R2d § 370 - Requirement that Benefit be Conferred**
  * In order to get restitution damages, you have to have conferred a benefit on the other party through part performance or reliance
* **R2d § 371 - Measuring Restitution Damages**
  * Restitution damages may as justice requires be measured by either (non-breaching party can choose):
    1. The reasonable value to the other party of what he received (based on what it would have cost him to get it from someone else); OR
    1. The extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced
       * Measure is unaffected by any loss which would have been incurred in complete performance (though any payments already made must be subtracted)
       * Breaching party is limited to lesser of (a) or (b)
       * Must be shown w/ reasonable certainty
* **R2d § 373 - Restitution When Other Party Is in Breach**
  * On a breach by non-performance that gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach or on a repudiation, the injured party is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance
  * The injured party has no right to restitution if he has performed all of his duties under the contract and no performance by the other party remains due other than payment of a definite sum of money for that performance
* **R2d § 374 - Restitution in Favor of Party in Breach**
  * If a party justifiably refuses to perform on the ground that his remaining duties of performance have been discharged by the other party's breach, the party in breach is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred by way of part performance or reliance in excess of the loss that he has caused by his own breach (i.e. value of part performance conferred minus expectation damages)
  * To the extent that, under the manifested assent of the parties, a party's performance is to be retained in the case of breach, that party is not entitled to restitution if the value of the performance as liquidated damages is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof of loss
    * Restitution not available for party that intentionally varied terms of the contract, as they are acting officiously
* **R2d § 375 - Restitution When Contract Is Within Statute of Frauds**
  * A party who would otherwise have a claim in restitution under a contract is not barred from restitution for the reason that the contract is unenforceable by him because of the Statute of Frauds unless the Statute provides otherwise or its purpose would be frustrated by allowing restitution
* **R2d § 376 - Restitution When Contract Is Voidable**
  * A party who has avoided a contract on the ground of lack of capacity, mistake, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence or abuse of a fiduciary relation is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance
* **R2d § 377 - Restitution in Cases of Impracticability, Frustration, Non-Occurrence of Condition or Disclaimer by Beneficiary**
  * A party whose duty of performance does not arise or is discharged as a result of impracticability of performance, frustration of purpose, non-occurrence of a condition or disclaimer by a beneficiary is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance
