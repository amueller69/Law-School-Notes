# Alternatives to Expectation Damages

## Reliance Damages

* Party can recover reliance damages for breach even if they can’t prove expectation damages with reasonable certainty
* A party may not recover money spent in reliance on the contract if it can be proven that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for the injured party
  * An award for reliance on the contract must reflect any loss that the injured party would have suffered had the contract been fully performed (subtracted from reliance damages)
  * Embodies principle that a party shouldn't be able to escape bad bargain through reliance damages
* An award of damages will not be reduced due to an injured party’s failure to mitigate when the facts are clear that both parties had the same opportunity to mitigate
* Promissory Estoppel Contexts
  * Judges have discretion to limit remedy as justice requires
    * May limit relief to damages measured by extent of reliance (i.e. out-of-pocket expenses) instead of full expectation damages
    * Majority of jurisdictions have adopted this approach
  * Some courts hold that relief P.E. cases should ALWAYS be measured by actual reliance

### Rules

* **R2d § 349 - Reliance Damages**
  * As an alternative to expectation damages, the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest, including expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance, minus any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed (burden on D to show that the K would have been a losing one)

### *Wartzman v. Hightower Productions, Ltd.*

P establishes and capitalizes new corporation to finance attempt to break world record. D hired as law firm and provides guidance, though fails to comply with securities regulations and informs P that securities specialist needs to be hired to straighten things out. P can't afford it and D refuses to pay. Record breaking attempt indefinitely postponed. P brings suit. **If expectation damage for lost profits can’t be shown w/ reasonable certainty (i.e. too speculative) money spent in part performance, in preparation for, or in reliance on the K are recoverable**.  Court holds P was injured due to its reliance on the contract; it sold stock and incurred substantial obligations in reliance on the contract. Additionally, **if D can establish that full performance would have resulted in a net loss for P, then reliance damages can be limited or excluded altogether**. D was unable to establish that P would have suffered a net loss from its venture, so this exception is not applicable here. Court also found that P did not fail duty to mitigate as suggested by P. P lacked the funds necessary to hire a securities specialist, **a substantial obligation that P is not required to incur in order to mitigate**. Further, D had the same opportunity to mitigate and refused to do so. Thus, court holds P should be permitted to recover reliance damages.

### *Walser v. Toyota*

P initiates process to become dealer of cars sold by D. Three step process: Application, letter of intent containing conditions, and then formal agreement. P completes first step and D informs them that letter of intent approved and "they were [their] dealer". D later informs them that this was a mistake and letter had not been approved. P had already purchased facility for dealership. P files suit seeking full relief (including lost profits) under theories of breach and promissory estoppel. TC awards relief on promissory estoppel grounds, but limits damage to out of pocket expenditures, which was **price paid minus FMV**. P appeals. CoA points to Restatements description of remedies available in promissory estoppel cases, providing that, **where appropriate, relief may be limited to that measured by the extent of P's reliance rather than the terms of the contract. Thus, this places the damages decision within the trial judge’s discretion**. Here, D provided evidence showing that a formal dealership agreement was far from certain while P did not demonstrated any opportunity lost by virtue of relying on the promise. CoA asserts that it won't interfere with lower court discretionary decisions so long as it "remains within the range of choice" (it did), accounts for all relevant factors (it did), and does not constitute a clear error judgement (it doesn't). Thus, CoA affirms TC's judgement

## Restitutionary Damages

* Based on concept of unjust enrichment, so breaching party may still claim in restitution
  * This may create perverse incentives
* Restitution damages sometimes put a party in a better place than expectation damages, causing commentators to disagree over this doctrine
  * Justified because party may get good deal, if they breach, court should be able to take away that good deal and give fair market value of services
* Three ways restitution comes up as a damage remedy
  1. Modern contract law - a remedy for breach
     * Non-breaching party can choose restitutionary rather than ED for breach of K UNLESS she has already performed all of her duties under the K and nothing is due from the other party than a payment of money for that performance, in which case only expectation damages are available
  1. Breaching part may even be entitled to restitution if he conferred a benefit to the other party by part performance
  1. If K unenforceable for some reason, either or both parties may be entitled to restitutionary relief for benefits conferred (e.g. Statute of Frauds, incapacity/mutual mistake, etc.)

### Rules - Restitutionary Damages

* **R2d § 370 - Requirement that Benefit be Conferred**
  * In order to get restitution damages, you have to have conferred a benefit on the other party through part performance or reliance
* **R2d § 371 - Measuring Restitution Damages**
  * Restitution damages may as justice requires be measured by either (non-breaching party can choose):
    1. The reasonable value to the other party of what he received (based on what it would have cost him to get it from someone else); OR
    1. The extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced
       * Measure is unaffected by any loss which would have been incurred in complete performance (though any payments already made must be subtracted)
       * Breaching party is limited to lesser of (a) or (b)
       * Must be shown w/ reasonable certainty
* **R2d § 373 - Restitution When Other Party Is in Breach**
  * On a breach by non-performance that gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach or on a repudiation, the injured party is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance
  * The injured party has no right to restitution if he has performed all of his duties under the contract and no performance by the other party remains due other than payment of a definite sum of money for that performance
* **R2d § 374 - Restitution in Favor of Party in Breach**
  * If a party justifiably refuses to perform on the ground that his remaining duties of performance have been discharged by the other party's breach, the party in breach is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred by way of part performance or reliance in excess of the loss that he has caused by his own breach (i.e. value of part performance conferred minus expectation damages)
  * To the extent that, under the manifested assent of the parties, a party's performance is to be retained in the case of breach, that party is not entitled to restitution if the value of the performance as liquidated damages is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof of loss
    * Restitution not available for party that intentionally varied terms of the contract, as they are acting officiously
* **R2d § 375 - Restitution When Contract Is Within Statute of Frauds**
  * A party who would otherwise have a claim in restitution under a contract is not barred from restitution for the reason that the contract is unenforceable by him because of the Statute of Frauds unless the Statute provides otherwise or its purpose would be frustrated by allowing restitution
* **R2d § 376 - Restitution When Contract Is Voidable**
  * A party who has avoided a contract on the ground of lack of capacity, mistake, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence or abuse of a fiduciary relation is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance
* **R2d § 377 - Restitution in Cases of Impracticability, Frustration, Non-Occurrence of Condition or Disclaimer by Beneficiary**
  * A party whose duty of performance does not arise or is discharged as a result of impracticability of performance, frustration of purpose, non-occurrence of a condition or disclaimer by a beneficiary is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance

### *Coastal Steel v. Algernon Blair*

D entered into a contract with P for P to supply equipment and perform steel erection on hospital. P began performance, but D refused to pay for some of the performance in dispute over contractual obligations. P terminated performance (28% complete) and brings suit. TC rules that D's actions constituted breach and that P was justified in terminating performance. However, it also held that P would have lost money on the contract had it completed performance and thus denied recovery. P appealed. **CoA held that suit seeking restitutionary damages allows an injured party to recover the value of services given, regardless of whether he would be able to recover expectation damages in a claim of breach. The measure of damages is the reasonable value of performance provided, regardless of any loss which would have been incurred by complete performance**. While contract price may be evidence of this reasonable value, it does not measure value of performance. Rather, **damages are measured by the amount for which the injured party’s performance could have been purchased at the time of performance**. Court thus rules that damages are recoverable and remands to lower court for determination of this value. Since P would not have gotten expectation damages (due to projected loss) or reliance damages (can't exceed expectation), P is still able to recover restitutionary damages which put them in a better position than if full performance would have taken place

### *Lancellotti v. Thomas*

P agreed to buy a luncheonette business from D and rent the premises. $25,000 for the business plus promise to build (and pay for) an addition. P paid the $25,000 and began operating the business. Problems during construction of the addition, which D's must ultimately complete. About a year in, P stopped operating the business. It hadn't paid any rent up to that point. P filed a complaint seeking the return of his $25,000, despite concession that it owed D for rent. TC held in favor of the D, denying P recovery and awarding D the rent money owed. P appealed. Traditional rule prohibited recovery of any damages by breaching party. However, CoA, in applying modern rule, held that it is **possible for breacher to get restitutionary damages if value of its part performance was in excesses of loss caused to non-breaching party**. Purpose of contract law is not to punish parties for willful breach. Would be allowing a windfall if permitting non-breaching party to recover expectation damages will still retaining the value of performance that had been rendered

### *Ventura v. Titan Sports, Inc*

Jesse "the Body" Ventura, sues the WWF. He contends contracts did not include right to royalties for further publicity in action figures and VHS, despite WWF's distribution of such. Court holds that **where there is a gap in an express contract (or no enforceable contract at all), but party has conferred an uncompensated benefit unknowingly (not officiously or gratuitously) and other party has been unjustly enriched, then P can get restitutionary damages. The restitutionary damages for benefits conferred are available even if contract is unenforceable due to impracticability, impossibility, frustration of purpose, or other issue in formation.**

  * Will not order specific performance if damages adequate
  * Will not deny specific performance if damages are good for only part
  * Specific performance will not be denied simply because there is another remedy (though may be considered in exercising discretion)
* **R2d § 360 - Factors Affecting Adequacy of Damages**

  * The likelihood that an award of damages could not be collected
* **R2d § 362 - Effect of Uncertainty of Terms**
  * Specific performance or an injunction will not be granted unless the terms of the contract are sufficiently certain to provide a basis for an appropriate order
* **R2d § 363 - Effect of Insecurity as to the Agreed Exchange**
  * Specific performance or an injunction may be refused if a substantial part of the agreed exchange for the performance to be compelled is unperformed and its performance is not secured to the satisfaction of the court
* **R2d § - 364 Effect of Unfairness**
  * Specific performance or an injunction will be refused if such relief would be unfair because
    1. The contract was induced by mistake or by unfair practices
    1. The relief would cause unreasonable hardship or loss to the party in breach or to third persons, or
    1. The exchange is grossly inadequate or the terms of the contract are otherwise unfair
  * Specific performance or an injunction will be granted in spite of a term of the agreement if denial of such relief would be unfair because it would cause unreasonable hardship or loss to the party seeking relief or to third persons.
* **R2d § - 365 Effect of Public Policy**
  * Specific performance or an injunction will not be granted if the act or forbearance that would be compelled or the use of compulsion is contrary to public policy
* **R2d § 366 - Effect of Difficulty in Enforcement or Supervision**
  * A promise will not be specifically enforced if the character and magnitude of the performance would impose on the court burdens in enforcement or supervision that are disproportionate to the advantages to be gained from enforcement and to the harm to be suffered from its denial
* **R2d § 367 - Contracts for Personal Service or Supervision**
  * A promise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced
  * A promise to render personal service exclusively for one employer will not be enforced by an injunction against serving another if its probable result will be to compel a performance involving personal relations the enforced continuance of which is undesirable or will be to leave the employee without other reasonable means of making a living
* **UCC § 2-716 - Buyer's Right to Specific Performance or Replevin**
  * Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances
  * The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just
  * The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered
* **CISG Article 28**
  * Court is not required to order specific performance unless it would also do so under its domestic law
    * Some European countries more liberal w/ specific performance—pick your forum carefully
* **CISG Article 46**
  * If goods don’t conform w/ the K and this is a fundamental breach of the K, buyer may require (with reasonable notice)
    * Delivery of substitute goods, OR

  * Seller may require buyer to pay the price, take delivery or perform his other obligations

### *City Stores v. Ammerman*

P to assist D in re-zoning proposal efforts necessary to build shopping mall. In exchange, P would get option contract to occupy space in mall. D granted re-zoning and began leasing store spaces. It refused to lease space to P because of better competing offer. P brought suit seeking specific performance. An option is a unilateral contract that exists as a continuing offer for either a fixed or reasonable period of time and may be enforced through specific performance if its terms are reasonably definite. While letter expressing offer was not very clear as to terms of option contract, such terms can be ascertained from leases already signed with similar businesses. Since **other forms of damages (ED in particular) too difficult to calculate**, denying specific performance due to lack of definiteness would leave P without a remedy. For this reason, and because it would also place no hardship upon D, court rules that specific performance is an adequate remedy

### *Reier Broadcasting Company, Inc. v. Kramer*

Football coach (D) has contract giving exclusive broadcast rights on his interviews/appearances to P, a radio station. The school at which P coaches signs a deal with another station in which coach is expected to appear on that station's broadcasts. P wishes to enforce restrictive covenant against D. Since this is categorized as a personal service, court cannot issue specific performance to force D to continue appearing on P's broadcasts, but it can order injunction to prevent him from appearing on competitor's broadcast. However, court holds that where specific performance would be unavailable to enforce affirmative covenant in an agreement(e.g. personal services), an injunction to enforce a negative covenant would amount to indirectly enforcing the affirmative part. Despite restatement's view that such injunction is only unavailable if it would leave party without reasonable means to make a living and D's primary employment was as a coach (not a broadcast guest), court prevents enforcement.

## Agreed Remedies

* Common law allows party to write in damages into contract for breach
  * Will generally enforce unless it is seen as a penalty
  * Old common law rule: determines reasonability at time of contract – anticipated
  * New rule: determines reasonability at time of breach – actual damages
    * If actual loss is much less than liquidated damages, some courts will just strike down the liquidated damages clause. (Dissent in Barrie School) (Majority disagrees)
* R2d uses an OR—reasonable in light of anticipated OR actual loss (9th Cir. follows this in UCC, commercially sophisticated actors context)
  * Modern courts read “or” as an “and” (must be both reasonable in anticipation and in actuality)
* R2d seems to say only use liquidated damages if actual damages are hard to figure out
  * Courts really focus on the reasonableness part of it
  * In Barrie School, evidence of loss appeared to be ascertainable. Why court determine that actual loss difficult to tell?
    * Deference to an institution about how complicated it is to figure out what the loss of one child due to breach might be ex ante—that’s why they contracted to this.
  * Some courts require mitigation even in cases where K has liquidated damages, *Barrie School* court did not
* Unconscionability can bar enforcement of these clauses

### Rules - Agreed Remedies

* **R2d § 281 Accord and Satisfaction**
  * An accord is a contract under which an obligee promises to accept a stated performance in satisfaction of the obligor's existing duty. Performance of the accord discharges the original duty
  * Until performance of the accord, the original duty is suspended unless there is such a breach of the accord by the obligor as discharges the new duty of the obligee to accept the performance in satisfaction. If there is such a breach, the obligee may enforce either the original duty or any duty under the accord
  * Breach of the accord by the obligee does not discharge the original duty, but the obligor may maintain a suit for specific performance of the accord, in addition to any claim for damages for partial breach
* **R2d § 356 - Liquidated Damages + Penalties**
  * Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount that is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof of loss. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty
  * A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is a penalty + unenforceable on public policy grounds (aim is not punitive)
* **R2d § 361 - Effect of Provision for Liquidated Damages**
  * Specific performance or an injunction may be granted even though there is a provision for liquidated damages
    * A contract provision for payment of a sum of money as damages may not afford an adequate remedy even though it is valid as one for liquidated damages and not a penalty
* **UCC § 2-718 - Liquidation of Damages**
  * Parties may agree to damages at an amount reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise getting an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty. An unreasonably small amount might be stricken under unconscionability
* **UCC § 2-719 - Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy**
  * An agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts. Resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy
  * Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act
  * Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not

### *Barrie School v. Patch*

D enrolled their daughter in a private Montessori school (P). Parties entered into a re-enrollment agreement that required D to pay a $1,000 non-refundable deposit and to notify the P in writing by May 31 if they intended to withdraw their daughter before the end of the school year. If D notifies after that date, they agreed to pay the remaining tuition balance of $13,490 pursuant to a liquidated damages clause. D notifies of withdrawal after deadline and demanded the return of their deposit. P brings suit for breach and sought the remaining tuition balance for the academic year plus fees. P filed a counter-claim for return of deposit. TC held that the liquidated damages clause was valid/legally enforceable, but P failed mitigate its damages. P appealed. State supreme court held **a non-breaching party has no duty to mitigate damages where the parties agree to a valid liquidated damages sum in the event of a contract breach**. Liquidated damages differ from mitigation of damages. While mitigation is part of a court’s determination of actual damages that have resulted from a breach, a liquidated damages clause is an agreed-upon sum by both parties in order to replace any determination by a court of an actual loss suffered by the injured party. Once a court has found that a liquidated damages clause is valid and binding upon the parties, it does not need to make any determination regarding actual damages. Court identifies three essential elements to valid/enforceable liquidated damages clause. First, there must be clear and unambiguous terms for a specific sum. Second, the damages must reasonably compensate the injured party. Third, liquidated damages clauses, by their nature, are binding before the fact and may not be altered to correspond to actual damages determined after the breach. All of these elements were satisfied, thus the clause is binding and P had no obligation to mitigate. **Dissent** - majority decision undermines basic principles of contract law pertaining to the equity and reasonableness of contract remedies. Remedies are meant to be compensatory, not punitive. Must consider totality of the circumstances in determining whether a liquidated damages clause is fair and reasonable. Here, amount in the clause is grossly disproportionate to, and in excess of, the harm suffered. Additionally, the School owed a duty to mitigate its damages in an attempt to avoid any purported loss
