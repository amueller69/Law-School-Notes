# Negligence

## Introduction

### Negligence Defined

* Elements to a tort of negligence
  * D must have owed a duty to P
  * D must have breached the standard of care
  * P has to have suffered an injury (i.e. physical, emotional, or economic harm)
  * D’s breach of standard of care must have been cause of P’s injury
* Restatement (Second) - § 282 Negligence Defined
  > In the Restatement of this Subject, negligence is conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm. It does not include conduct recklessly disregardful of an interest of others.

### Negligence from Law and Economics Perspective

* Determination of negligence can be roughly reduced to cost/benefit calculus
  * If the cost of a precautionary measure (i.e. upholding standard of care) is exceeded by its benefit, failure to take this precaution should result in liability for damages that result
* Optimal legal framework will induce the most efficient amount of precautionary behavior
  * Involves setting the parameters of reasonableness through some sort of efficiency analysis
  * This standard of reasonableness is duty court places on individuals when taking precautions

## Reasonable Person

### Reasonable Person Standard

* Determines whether defendant acted with reasonable care by determining what a reasonable person would do in the same situation
* Objective Standard - Eternal standard, no attention paid to individual’s particular feelings or capabilities
  * Standard is not lowered for those with mental or physical deficiencies
* Subjective Standard - Defendant’s characteristics own characteristics are examined and determine if a reasonable person with those characteristics would have acted the same way
* Issue with variable standards
  * Difficulty that arises from applying universal set of standards
  * Expert/Novice - General rule holds a beginner to the same standard of care expected from someone reasonably skilled in the field
    * This deters the inexperienced from engaging in excessive risk taking
    * Converse problem can also arise for someone of superior skill or knowledge who would be held to a lower standard than of which she is capable. Both restatements make exceptions to the general rule, requiring individual with superior skill/knowledge exercise same level of care as would the average reasonable individual had they possessed the same level of skill/knowledge
  * Age
    * When a minor undertakes an adult activity which can result in grave danger to himself and to others, he is held liable to the same standard as the ordinarily prudent adult
    * There are many exceptions, but the general rule is intended to deter minors from engaging in dangerous activity
* Wealth should be excluded as a consideration when calculating negligent standard of care
  * Legal rules are poor mechanism for redistributing wealth. Tax system is superior in this regard
* Restatement (Second) - § 283 Conduct of a Reasonable Man: The Standard
  > Unless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances.

#### *Vaughan v. Menlove*

D builds a hay rick on border of property, next to Ds' cottages. He was repeatedly warned that the haystack was likely to catch fire. Instead of removing it, D builds chimney around the haystack. It eventually caught fire and burned down neighboring cottages. P sues for damages. D argues that he was using his best judgment when he ignored warnings. The court agrees that there was indeed a substantial risk of a fire. **It applies objective standard, in which the standard of caution is that of a person with average intelligence**. A subjective standard, which would take into account the capacities of the individual, would be so variable that it would be difficult to apply. Thus it didn't matter if D used is best subjective judgement-he is liable because the average person would have taken more caution.

#### *Roberts v. Ring*

7 year old boy (P) runs into the street in front of a car driven by 77 year old man (D). D hits P while traveling 4-5 mph, but hearing and sight were defective. Both parties claim the other acted negligently.  The court applied objective standard for D, despite his age and physical infirmities. Thus, court ruled D was negligent because he failed to meet the objective standard of reasonable care. If an individual cannot meet requisite standard of car associated with an activity, then they should be deterred from engaging in it.

#### *Daniels v. Evans*

P, a 19 year old "youth", was riding a motorcycle and collided with plaintiff’s car and was killed. His estate sues in negligence and is awarded damages. D appeals saying that child engaged in adult activity should be held to an adult standard of care. CoA awards judgment for D because the minor was acting as an adult since riding a motorcycle is an activity intended for adults

### Insanity and Mental Incapacity

* Finding of negligence in individuals with mental illness or incapacity
  * Third Restatement holds mental and emotional are generally not considered in determinations of negligence
  * However, several courts recognize the *Breunig* **exception for sudden and unforeseeable mental incapacity**
* Economic Incentives  
  * Induce the estate of the insane person to take greater precautions
  * However, we don't want to place an excessive cost/burden on insitutions to protect themselves from liability
    * *Jankee v. Clarke County* - Court applied an objective standard in refusing to extend liability to a patient who had escaped from the premises of a psychiatric ward. The court wanted to minimize the level of institutionalization and found that it would be irrational to install bars on all windows.  

#### *Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co.*

Driver of vehicle insured by D was suddenly overcome by "insane delusion" rendering her unable to operate the vehicle. Vehicle veers off into P's car. Driver had history of mental illness and hallucinatory visions. D refuses to pay the claim, arguing the driver could not be held negligent because of the delusion. TC initially ruled for the P, asserting the driver's “sudden” insanity was foreseeable based on prior incidents. CoA rules that **insanity may be a defense to liability for negligence if an individual is suddenly overcome by a mental episode rendering them incapable of conforming his conduct to the standards of a reasonable man and which was unknown to them prior to the harm.** Sudden mental incapacity is analogous to sudden heart attack or stroke. However, since driver had some knowledge of that such incapacity was possible based on prior diagnoses and similar episodes, court affirms TC's decision.

### Physical Disability

* **The standard of care required of a person with a disability is that of the level of care which a reasonable person under the same or similar disability would exercise under the circumstances**
  * Third Restatement - "conduct of an actor with a physical disability is negligent only if the conduct does not conform to that of a reasonably careful person with the same disability"

#### *Fletcher v. City of Aberdeen*

P is a blind man that falls into a hole after a city construction worker temporarily removed the barricade around it. P brings suit for negligence against city. City claims that standard of care does not include thinking about blind people. Court enters judgement in favor of P, holding that the city breached a duty by removing barrier. City is obliged to provide use of its streets to the physically disabled, the the standard of care extends to blind people (**heightened duty of care**). Blind man is not liable for contributory negligence because he used the level of care that a reasonable person under the same or similar disability would exercise under the circumstances.

## Calculus of Risk

* Henry Terry on Negligence
  * To make conduct negligent, risk involved must be unreasonably great and some injury unreasonably probable
    * All conduct involves assuming some level of risk or possibility of injury; it is conduct that presents an unreasonable amount of risk that is allocatively undesirable
    * Risk tradeoff varies circumstantially - large risk may be reasonable in some circumstances, small risk may be unreasonable in others
  * Reasonableness of a given risk depends on 5 factors
    1. Magnitude of the risk
    1. Value or importance of that exposed to the risk (i.e. the "principle object")
    1. The value or importance of the "collateral object", the pursuit of which is the reason for taking the risk
    1. Utility of the risk - probability of the "collateral object" being obtained or achieved
    1. Necessity of the risk - probability the collateral object would not have been attained without taking the risk
  * Alex's Critique - Seemingly arbitrary without any way to quantify the factors. How does this operate at the margins? How do we know precisely when factors justifying risk outweigh opposing considerations and crosses the threshold of reasonableness? How much does moral intuition factor into this?
* Balancing Risk
  * *Osborne* - Cost/Benefit (benefit of driving v. risk to pedestrian)
    * Tradeoff exists to the extent that risk can be denominated monetarily. People are willing to be compensated for incurring risk
    * Tradeoff isn't necessarily linear - That people will spend any amount of money to avoid certain risk of death DOES NOT mean they will spend any amount of money to avoid low risks of death.
  * *Cooley* - Utilitarian approach
    * Consider what duty is to the greatest number of people who may suffer from greatest risk
    * The law does not contemplate a shifting duty between potential Plaintiffs; this would be inconsistent with the fundamental conception of the duty of due care requiring the measure of care reasonable under the circumstances
  * Criticism from Shavell
    * Negligence rule won't affect level of activity, but only the level of due care in performing that activity
      * Not concerned with whether one engages in activity, but level of care taken after one decides to engage in activity
    * Strict liability, on the other hand, will induce people to consider potential losses of both their level of activity and level of care (i.e. only drive when utility gained outweighs expected liability)
    * Is exclusion of activity-level considerations from the negligence formula inefficient?
* Hand Formula
  * The Hand Formula assesses negligence based on assigning values to Burden of adequate precaution, Probability that injury occurs, and Magnitude/gravity of Injury (L)
    * B < PL
  * The “P” Problem – Errors in Probability
    * Cognitive bias in assumption that what happened was probable outcome in retrospect
    * Drive P up because the only things that make torts suit actionable litigation are what has already happened
    * *Carroll Towing* - Judge Hand notes that probability of damage was HIGH given the context (midday, wartime with lots of ships going in and out of port)

### *Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks*

Pipes are laid 25 years earlier. They explode due to extraordinary cold weather and flood P's property. P brings action to recover damages, arguing that pipe installers failed to use proper care. Court holds that an **individual is not liable for taking reasonable precautions that fail to protect against unforeseen/extreme circumstance. Ds are liable for negligence when they fail to do what is reasonably prudent under the circumstances; it is unreasonable to take extra expenses that do not aid in preventing unlikely/unforeseen harm.** Court found that, upon installation, D took care to protect against frost. However, the risk of such a severe frost was so small that it is unreasonable to expect one to take added precautions in order to protect against it. Thus, D took reasonable care and could not be held liable for accident which occurred due to extraordinary occurrence.

### *Osborne v. Montgomery*

P injured on bicycle after colliding with door of stopped car opened by D. Court holds D did not act negligently. **Acts that injure others but are not negligent should not result in liability because these acts conform to what great mass of people would do under the same circumstances. Ordinary care is what is required, nothing more.**

### *Cooley v. Public Service Co.*

Telephone company runs wires above street, fully compliant with standard safety precautions. D also ran power lines above street, though these were not insulated. Power line fell onto telephone line, burning through it and causing a loud noise which harmed P. She sues telephone company for damages. TC found for Telephone company and against D. CoA reverses, finding that D exercised appropriate precautions and that taking additional precautions to prevent injury to P would have **posed an even greater risk to and even greater number of people** (electrocution to pedestrians). Hence, D not liable

### *United States v. Carroll Towing Co*

Sinking of a barge when D’s tug attempted a tricky maneuver. D counter-claimed company that had chartered a barge. D raised contributory negligence as a partial defense because no one was manning the barge that could have detected and alerted someone to the sinking, thus avoiding the damages. Court held that company that chartered barge was negligent because it is not beyond reasonable expectation that a barge owner would have an employee on board during daylight hours. Owners **duty is a function of three variables: (1) probability of harm, (2) gravity of harm, and (3) the burden of adequate precautions. When the burden is less than the gravity of the loss times its probability (B<PL) individual who fails to take burden of precaution is liable for damage.** Thus, since it would not have been unduly burdensome for to properly staff, and considering enormity of the loss and reasonable possibility of the ship sinking, the company is contributorily negligent

## Medical Malpractice

* Medical issues are treated uniquely based on the assumption that jurors are not capable of identifying a duty and determining whether it was satisfied.
  * Courts heavily rely on custom, relying on expert consensus/testimony to determine standard of care.
  * Over time, the standard of care shifted from one based on the locality to a national one.
    * Presents some potential difficulties, namely that disparities in knowledge, resources, and technology among providers make it very challenging for certain a consistent national standard of care.
    * This shift has help combat the biases in favor of medical personnel. It also better enables patients to weigh the convenience of local care vs risks or inadequate care, as a physician must inform patients of limitations in facilities and capabilities prior to treatment. However, the communication of this risk isn't always efficient.

### Lama v. Boras

**Facts**:
Doctor finds that plaintiff has herniated disk. She doesn’t prescribe absolute bed rest as is typically prescribed before the operation. There were significant post surgical complications because adequate pre-operation precautions were not ordered. No-antibiotics had been prescribed, pre or post-operation. Patient brings suit claiming doctor was negligent in four areas: failure to provide proper conservative medical treatment, premature and improper discharge, negligent performance of surgery, and failure to provide proper management for the infection.

**Ruling**:
In order to establish medical malpractice, patient must demonstrate:

1. The basic norms of care applicable to physicians or specialists
2. Proof the medical personnel failed to follow the basic norms
3. Causal relation between failing to follow the norm and the harm to patient
