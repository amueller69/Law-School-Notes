# Negligence

## Negligence in General

* Elements to a tort of negligence
  * D must have owed a duty to P
  * D must have breached the standard of care
  * P has to have suffered an injury (i.e. physical, emotional, or economic harm)
  * D’s breach of standard of care must have been cause of P’s injury
* Restatement (Second) - § 282 Negligence Defined
  > In the Restatement of this Subject, negligence is conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm. It does not include conduct recklessly disregardful of an interest of others.

### Law and Economics Perspective

* Determination of negligence can be roughly reduced to cost/benefit calculus
  * If the cost of a precautionary measure (i.e. upholding standard of care) is exceeded by its benefit, failure to take this precaution should result in liability for damages that result
* Optimal legal framework will induce the most efficient amount of precautionary behavior
  * Involves setting the parameters of reasonableness through some sort of efficiency analysis
  * This standard of reasonableness is duty court places on individuals when taking precautions

## Reasonable Person

* Determines whether defendant acted with reasonable care by determining what a reasonable person would do in the same situation
  * Objective Standard - Eternal standard, no attention paid to individual’s particular feelings or capabilities
    * Standard is not lowered for those with mental or physical deficiencies
  * Subjective Standard - Defendant’s characteristics own characteristics are examined and determine if a reasonable person with those characteristics would have acted the same way
  * Issue with variable standards
    * Difficulty that arises from applying universal set of standards
    * Expert/Novice - General rule holds a beginner to the same standard of care expected from someone reasonably skilled in the field
      * This deters the inexperienced from engaging in excessive risk taking
      * Converse problem can also arise for someone of superior skill or knowledge who would be held to a lower standard than of which she is capable. Both restatements make exceptions to the general rule, requiring individual with superior skill/knowledge exercise same level of care as would the average reasonable individual had they possessed the same level of skill/knowledge
    * Age
      * When a minor undertakes an adult activity which can result in grave danger to himself and to others, he is held liable to the same standard as the ordinarily prudent adult
      * There are many exceptions, but the general rule is intended to deter minors from engaging in dangerous activity
* Restatement (Second) - § 283 Conduct of a Reasonable Man: The Standard
  > Unless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances.

### [*Vaughan v. Menlove*](javascript:void(0);)

D builds a hay rick on border of property, next to Ds' cottages. He was repeatedly warned that the haystack was likely to catch fire. Instead of removing it, D builds chimney around the haystack. It eventually caught fire and burned down neighboring cottages. P sues for damages. D argues that he was using his best judgment when he ignored warnings. The court agrees that there was indeed a substantial risk of a fire. It applies objective standard, in which the standard of caution is that of a person with average intelligence. A subjective standard, which would take into account the capacities of the individual, would be so variable that it would be difficult to apply. Thus it didn't matter if D used is best subjective judgement-he is liable because the average person would have taken more caution.

### [*Roberts v. Ring*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I6a5d22c7006011da83e7e9deff98dc6f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

7 year old boy (P) runs into the street in front of a car driven by 77 year old man (D). D hits P while traveling 4-5 mph, but hearing and sight were defective. Both parties claim the other acted negligently.  The court applied objective standard for D, despite his age and physical infirmities. Thus, court ruled D was negligent because he failed to meet the objective standard of reasonable care. If an individual cannot meet requisite standard of car associated with an activity, then they should be deterred from engaging in it.

### [*Daniels v. Evans*](javascript:void(0);)

P, a 19 year old "youth", was riding a motorcycle and collided with plaintiff’s car and was killed. His estate sues in negligence and is awarded damages. D appeals saying that child engaged in adult activity should be held to an adult standard of care. CoA awards judgment for D because the minor was acting as an adult since riding a motorcycle is an activity intended for adults

## Medical Malpractice

* Medical issues are treated uniquely based on the assumption that jurors are not capable of identifying a duty and determining whether it was satisfied.
  * Courts heavily rely on custom, relying on expert consensus/testimony to determine standard of care.
  * Over time, the standard of care shifted from one based on the locality to a national one.
    * Presents some potential difficulties, namely that disparities in knowledge, resources, and technology among providers make it very challenging for certain a consistent national standard of care.
    * This shift has help combat the biases in favor of medical personnel. It also better enables patients to weigh the convenience of local care vs risks or inadequate care, as a physician must inform patients of limitations in facilities and capabilities prior to treatment. However, the communication of this risk isn't always efficient.

### Lama v. Boras

**Facts**:
Doctor finds that plaintiff has herniated disk. She doesn’t prescribe absolute bed rest as is typically prescribed before the operation. There were significant post surgical complications because adequate pre-operation precautions were not ordered. No-antibiotics had been prescribed, pre or post-operation. Patient brings suit claiming doctor was negligent in four areas: failure to provide proper conservative medical treatment, premature and improper discharge, negligent performance of surgery, and failure to provide proper management for the infection.

**Ruling**:
In order to establish medical malpractice, patient must demonstrate:

1. The basic norms of care applicable to physicians or specialists
2. Proof the medical personnel failed to follow the basic norms
3. Causal relation between failing to follow the norm and the harm to patient
