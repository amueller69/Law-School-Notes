# Causation

Function of the doctrine of proximate cause is to see whether more distant acts or events, in either time or space, create a prima facie case for liability.
Substantial Factor Test:
Did any intervening/concurrent human actions or natural events sever the causal connection between D's conduct and P's injury?

## Cause-in-Fact

* But For Causation Test: 'But for the D’s conduct, would the injury have occurred?'
  * 3 Steps
    1. Identify the D’s wrongful conduct
    1. What is the injury for which P is seeking redress? - Can only recover for injuries that he/she suffered
    1. Holding everything else constant, 'What would have happened had D not engaged in wrongful conduct? Injury?'
  * Plaintiff would not have been injured but for defendant’s conduct
  * The defense will try to show that there was a break between chain of events from the breach of duty to injury
  * Plaintiff will collapse all incidents together
  * This is a **counterfactual inquiry**: What would have happened if defendant had acted reasonably? If the injury would still have happened, than the negligence was not the cause in fact of the injury.
  * Restatement (Third) §26 - Factual Cause
    > Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct...
    > Comment b. - Factual Cause can also be described as a necessary condition for the outcome
    > Comment c. Conduct need only be one of multiple factual causes of the other's harm

### [*N.Y. Central R.R. vs. Grimstad*][N.Y.]

* Barge was in the port and P fell into the water when a tug bumped the boat. P wife went to find a life preserve to throw overboard to husband. Boat did not have life preserve.
* Judgment for D because even though a breach of duty was found, it could not be said that but for the life preserve being on the boat the husband would have survived
  * Court - "We think it's a question about which reasonable men might at least differ whether [P] would have been saved had [a life preserver] been there."
  * Hence **no factual cause**
* While it may be foreseeable to see that an injury will result because of no life preserve, you cannot use this test in linking breach of duty to causation of injury.

* Where a negligent act increases the chances that a particular type of accident would occur, and such an accident does in fact occur, a court may conclude that the negligent conduct was the cause of the injury.

### [*Zuchowicz v. US*][Zuchowicz]

* P was given a prescription for twice maximum recommended dosage of Danocrine
* After stopping dosage, P was diagnosed with rare disease PPH and died two years later
* She sued doctor and pharmacist for negligence in violating prevailing standard of care
* Issue: Was D's negligence in prescribing excessive dosage the cause in fact of P's illness and death?
* If a negligent act is deemed wrongful because it increased the chances of a mishap occurring, and the mishap occurs, that is deemed sufficient to support finding that negligence was a cause of injury
* Shift in the burden of proof
  * Strong evidence that causation existed puts it on D to prove that the OD did not cause the disease and death
  * Court - “Where such a strong causal link exists, it is up to the negligent party to ring in evidence denying but for cause and suggest that a in the actual case the wrongful conduct had not been a substantial factor."
  * D failed to defeat the finding of causation, thus P recovers

* Joint and Several Liability - Who bears the risk of insolvency when there are multiple tortfeasors?
  * **Joint Liability**
    * Each of several obligors can be responsible for the entire loss if the others are unable to pay
    * Makes sense in contexts in which contribution/harm is indivisible or the parties acted in concert
    * Example : Either D1 or D2 can be held liable for 100% of harm. Cant’ divide responsibility or server liability so one D gets off free
  * **Several Liability**
    * Each person has an obligation to pay only a proportionate share, thereby casting onto the plaintiff the risk of the insolvency of the other defendants
    * Casts the risk of defendant insolvency onto the plaintiff
    * Example: D1 only pays 80% and D2 only pays 20%.
  * **Joint and Several Liability**
    * Each defendant can be held responsible for entire loss even though jury can determine percentage of fault
    * Traditional method of apportionment for multiple causes
    * Example: Even though jury found D2 is only responsible for 20% of harm, he can be held for all if D1 is insolvent
    * Advantages
      * Allocates risk of insolvency on defendants that are solvent
      * Allows a plaintiff not at fault to recover, too bad if an at fault def. has to pay a bit more, at least P doesn’t have to pay
      * Allow P to go after either defendant to get a full recovery based on each party's capacity to pay damages
* Indemnity
  * Traditionally liable party sues codefendant for entire costs of damages, all or nothing
  * This is modified under partial indemnification rule
    * California passes statute allowing defendant to recover co-defendant's pro rata share
    * Provides right of contribution whereby each defendant pays his apportion of responsibility

### [*Union Stock Yards v. Chicago R.R.*][Union]

* One of the railroad cars had a defective nut and thereby injured the employee but both the terminal company and railroad company could have discovered the defect.
* Court under common law does not allow for partial indemnification; its “all or nothing."
* In order to determine if indemnification allowed, you use an active versus passive test. If one defendant is actively responsible for injury as opposed to the other parties passive responsibility, then indemnification is allowed.
  * Neither party can seek indemnity or contribution from the other unless the action of the other party was primarily responsible for the resulting injury
  * Justification: We want to place the ultimate burden on the individual who is fully wrong

* Multiple sufficient causes: If you cannot apportion damages because the harm is indivisible and two people’s actions were in unison (not with nature/God), then they are said to be jointly liable.
  * Justification: To allow two tortfeasors to argue that the other’s wrong is a defense would allow both to escape and apportionment would be impossible
  * Restatement (Third) §27 - Multiple Sufficient Causes
    > If multiple acts occur, each of which would have been a factual cause of the harm in the absence of the other act, each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm
    > * Synergistic cause: Where two or more causes' combined effect is greater than the sum of their parts, despite neither being sufficient to cause same level of harm alone, each is found as a factual cause of the harm
    > * Overdetermined cause: All actors held liable where a subset of them committing that act would have sufficed to cause the harm at issue. For example, if 3 men push car over, each is liable despite the fact that 2 men would have been sufficient
  * Restatement (Third) §26 - Apportionment of Liability
    > Damages can be divided by causation when the evidence provides a reasonable basis for the fact finder to determine if a party was responsible for a legal cause less than the entire damages for which P seeks recovery. Otherwise, the damages ares indivisible.

### [*Kingston v. Chicago*][Kingston]

The union of two fires destroys the property of Plaintiff.One fire was started by D and the other had an unidentified source, though manmade. P sues for recovery. Both fires were found to be proximate cause of the property damage. Court awards damages to P. D appeals. Since the both fires were manmade and the harm is indivisible, we have a joint action where defendant one will be held liable for everything. Important that the actions were both human initiated because a defendant cannot act jointly with a force of nature. If D’s fire joined a natural fire, P would not recover. Don’t know if the natural fire was the larger one, causing most of the damage so it would be unfair to hold D liable. In establishing causation, a “but-for” test will show that both D and unknown source acted jointly Thus, D is liable for entirety of damages.

* Alternative Liability - Indeterminate cause shifts burden of proof to defendants
  * When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm, and the plaintiff has introduced evidence that one of the two persons is responsible, D has the burden of proving that the other person was the sole cause of the harm, or liability should be imposed jointly. All tortfeasors must be before the court.
  * This is NOT a concert of action form of liability because only one defendant caused the harm
  * Fairness: Since the plaintiff is innocent and has been prevented from proving exact causation or to disestablish causation, we shift the burden to the tortfeasors to come forward and prove which defendant caused the injury
  * The plaintiff must still prove breach of a duty of care because he can only collect against tortfeasors
  * Restatement (Third) §28 - Burden of Proof
    > When P sues multiple actors and proves that each engaged in tortious conduct that exposed P to risk of harm and the conduct of at least one of them caused P's harm, P cannot reasonably be expected to prove which specific actor or actors caused the harm. The burden of proof on factual causation is shifted to the defendants

### [*Summers v. Tice*][Tice]
  
  D1 and D2 went hunting with P. Both shot in P’s direction at the same time and P was injured in the eye. It was impossible to know whether D1 or D2 caused the exact injury. Court rules that once we have established that both defendants have breached their duty of care, the burden shifts to them to disprove causation. Unless one of them does so, the are treated for the same purpose as joint tortfeasors

* Market Share Liability - Each manufacturer of a product causing injury s liable according to its market share
  * Rooted in logic as alternative liability - where as party cannot identify which of multiple defendants caused an injury, they are held jointly liable and burden of proof shifts to each defendant to demonstrate otherwise
  * Appropriate when a good is fungible and where it is impossible to determine who actually caused the injury
    * P must join enough manufacturers to have substantial share of market represented.
      * While 75-80% is the recommended amount, court only holds that the share be "substantial"
      * 51% - the rest of the market can be joined by Ds in additional cross compliant
      * If defendants represent unsubstantial market share, recoverable damages is limited to the market share represented
  * It is reasonable to measure the likelihood that a manufacture caused the injury in terms of the % of product that the manufacturer produces (i.e. market share)
  * Even if a D can demonstrate with evidence that, in a particular case, it was not responsible, courts do not permit such windfall exceptions and will nonetheless hold the manufacturer liable for the risk it exposed public to at the time
    * Economic vs. Corrective Justice approaches to tort law is very much present here
* Courts have been very reluctant to extend market share liability outside of drug cases
  * Found to be inapplicable in lead paint case due the fact that paint is not fungible - the level of lead in each manufacturers product may very significantly

### [*Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories*]

Drug, causes birth defects. Patient has no idea who manufacturer is because of mass production. Each and every manufacturer exposed a class of people, of which P is a part, to a risk of harm though only one actually created the risk to Sindell. Logical to group all the possible manufacturers together (like Ds in Tice). P sues all manufacturers for their portion of risk created, determined by market share. Rationale of Summers applies: between an innocent P and negligent Ds, Ds should bear the cost of the injury. This is only true, however, once it is shown that DES caused the injury. Unless a manufacturer can prove that it definitely did not cause the injury, each manufacturer. Pays according to market share.

* Loss of Chance
  * Recovery is allowed for decreased risk of survival. (damages proportional to reduced risk of survival)
    * Prevents malpractice defense asserting a patient was likely to die anyways, so negligence can't be seen as cause-in-fact.
    * D's conduct that increases the risk of death by decreasing the chances of survival (e.g. from 39% to 25%) is sufficient evidence to take the issue of proximate cause to the jury because actions forced the patient to lose chance of survival
    * Referenced in Restatement (Third) §26 Comment n.
  * Policy rationale - If don’t allow recovery for reduced risk, the medical profession wouldn’t have to give good care to anyone whose chance of survival was less than 50%

### [*Falcon v. Memorial Hospital*][Falcon]

P gave birth, went into respiratory collapse from rare embolism, and died. Expert medical witness testified that if an intravenous line had been placed when complications became apparent, P would have had a 37.5 percent chance of surviving the embolism. Question for court was whether D can be held liable for malpractice due to failure to act even if doing so would have had a sub 50% of survival.  
Court held that reduction in survival odds must not be > 50% in order to be recoverable. Thus court ruled D could be held liable for up to 37.5% of the damages.

### [*Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative*][Herskovits]

D's negligence in diagnosing P's cancer led to a 14% decrease in her chance of survival. P sues for damages and D argues that P would was more likely to die anyway, so negligence wasn’t the cause. Court faced with determining whether P could recover for the lost opportunity for survival. Court ultimately permits recovery not for death, but for lost chance of survival. It is certainly more likely than not that negligence caused lost chance for survival, thus proportion of wrongful damages can be recovered.

* Proof of Factual Causation and Expert Testimony
  * Fry Rule - Must be the case that the thing an expert is testifying to is consistent with consensus of the expert's field
    * If scientific finding has been “generally accepted” within field, it should be admitted
    * Justification - Juries have propensity to believe anything presented by someone who is supposed to represent authority
    * Expert evidence needs to be screen somehow
    * Peter Huber
      * Critique of "Junk Science" being introduced in court rooms leading to sub-optimal outcomes
    * This sentiment spreads and begins to put pressure on the courts
* Daubert Rule
  * Lists number of considerations for ensuring methodological rigour
  * More state's begin applying Daubert over Fry
* Success of a case can be contingent on admissibility expert testimony can
* Leaving decisions about admissibility to the discretion of judges in areas that far exceed their expertise
* Joyner?
* Abuse of Discretion Appellate Standard
  * Appealable, but as long as the admissibility decision isn't egregious and unreasonableness, deference will go to trial judge decision
* Methodological Soundness
  * Internal Validity - Relevance
  * External Validity - 
* Daubert Trilogy
  * Daubert - establishes judges as gatekeeper of evidence based 
  * Gatekeeper and defference on appeal
   * Kumho Tire 

* Psyschological Harms
  * Courts have been somewhat reluctant to award damages
    * To the extent they do allow it, there is require for physical manifestation
  * From economic standpoint
    * No good incentive to disallow when causal chain is clear
