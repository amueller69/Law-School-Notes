# Causation

Function of the doctrine of proximate cause is to see whether more distant acts or events, in either time or space, create a prima facie case for liability.
Substantial Factor Test:
Did any intervening/concurrent human actions or natural events sever the causal connection between D's conduct and P's injury?

## Cause-in-Fact

### But For Causation Test

* 'But for the D’s conduct, would the injury have occurred?'
* 3 Steps
  1. Identify the D’s wrongful conduct
  1. What is the injury for which P is seeking redress? - Can only recover for injuries that he/she suffered
  1. Holding everything else constant, 'What would have happened had D not engaged in wrongful conduct? Injury?'
* Plaintiff would not have been injured but for defendant’s conduct
* The defense will try to show that there was a break between chain of events from the breach of duty to injury
* Where a negligent act increases the chances that a particular type of accident would occur, and such an accident does in fact occur, a court may conclude that the negligent conduct was the cause of the injury.
* This is a **counterfactual inquiry**: What would have happened if defendant had acted reasonably? If the injury would still have happened, than the negligence was not the cause in fact of the injury.
* Restatement (Third) §26 - Factual Cause
  > Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct...
  > Comment b. - Factual Cause can also be described as a necessary condition for the outcome
  > Comment c. Conduct need only be one of multiple factual causes of the other's harm

#### *N.Y. Central R.R. vs. Grimstad*

Barge was in the port and P fell into the water when a tug bumped the boat. P wife went to find a life preserve to throw overboard to husband. Boat did not have life preserve. Judgment for D because even though a breach of duty was found, it could not be said that but for the life preserve being on the boat the husband would have survived. Court asserts, "We think it's a question about which reasonable men might at least differ whether [P] would have been saved had [a life preserver] been there." Hence, court held it was **no factual cause**. While it may be foreseeable to see that an injury will result because of no life preserve, you cannot use this test in linking breach of duty to causation of injury.

#### *Zuchowicz v. US*

* P was given a prescription for twice maximum recommended dosage of Danocrine
* After stopping dosage, P was diagnosed with rare disease PPH and died two years later
* She sued doctor and pharmacist for negligence in violating prevailing standard of care
* Issue: Was D's negligence in prescribing excessive dosage the cause in fact of P's illness and death?
* If a negligent act is deemed wrongful because it increased the chances of a mishap occurring, and the mishap occurs, that is deemed sufficient to support finding that negligence was a cause of injury
* Shift in the burden of proof
  * Strong evidence that causation existed puts it on D to prove that the OD did not cause the disease and death
  * Court - “Where such a strong causal link exists, it is up to the negligent party to ring in evidence denying but for cause and suggest that a in the actual case the wrongful conduct had not been a substantial factor."
  * D failed to defeat the finding of causation, thus P recovers

* Joint and Several Liability - Who bears the risk of insolvency when there are multiple tortfeasors?
  * **Joint Liability**
    * Each of several obligors can be responsible for the entire loss if the others are unable to pay
    * Makes sense in contexts in which contribution/harm is indivisible or the parties acted in concert
    * Example : Either D1 or D2 can be held liable for 100% of harm. Cant’ divide responsibility or server liability so one D gets off free
  * **Several Liability**
    * Each person has an obligation to pay only a proportionate share, thereby casting onto the plaintiff the risk of the insolvency of the other defendants
    * Casts the risk of defendant insolvency onto the plaintiff
    * Example: D1 only pays 80% and D2 only pays 20%.
  * **Joint and Several Liability**
    * Each defendant can be held responsible for entire loss even though jury can determine percentage of fault
    * Traditional method of apportionment for multiple causes
    * Example: Even though jury found D2 is only responsible for 20% of harm, he can be held for all if D1 is insolvent
    * Advantages
      * Allocates risk of insolvency on defendants that are solvent
      * Allows a plaintiff not at fault to recover, too bad if an at fault def. has to pay a bit more, at least P doesn’t have to pay
      * Allow P to go after either defendant to get a full recovery based on each party's capacity to pay damages
* Indemnity
  * Traditionally liable party sues codefendant for entire costs of damages, all or nothing
  * This is modified under partial indemnification rule
    * California passes statute allowing defendant to recover co-defendant's pro rata share
    * Provides right of contribution whereby each defendant pays his apportion of responsibility

### *Union Stock Yards v. Chicago R.R.*

* One of the railroad cars had a defective nut and thereby injured the employee but both the terminal company and railroad company could have discovered the defect.
* Court under common law does not allow for partial indemnification; its “all or nothing."
* In order to determine if indemnification allowed, you use an active versus passive test. If one defendant is actively responsible for injury as opposed to the other parties passive responsibility, then indemnification is allowed.
  * Neither party can seek indemnity or contribution from the other unless the action of the other party was primarily responsible for the resulting injury
  * Justification: We want to place the ultimate burden on the individual who is fully wrong

* Multiple sufficient causes: If you cannot apportion damages because the harm is indivisible and two people’s actions were in unison (not with nature/God), then they are said to be jointly liable.
  * Justification: To allow two tortfeasors to argue that the other’s wrong is a defense would allow both to escape and apportionment would be impossible
  * Restatement (Third) §27 - Multiple Sufficient Causes
    > If multiple acts occur, each of which would have been a factual cause of the harm in the absence of the other act, each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm
    > * Synergistic cause: Where two or more causes' combined effect is greater than the sum of their parts, despite neither being sufficient to cause same level of harm alone, each is found as a factual cause of the harm
    > * Overdetermined cause: All actors held liable where a subset of them committing that act would have sufficed to cause the harm at issue. For example, if 3 men push car over, each is liable despite the fact that 2 men would have been sufficient
  * Restatement (Third) §26 - Apportionment of Liability
    > Damages can be divided by causation when the evidence provides a reasonable basis for the fact finder to determine if a party was responsible for a legal cause less than the entire damages for which P seeks recovery. Otherwise, the damages ares indivisible.

### *Kingston v. Chicago*

The union of two fires destroys the property of Plaintiff.One fire was started by D and the other had an unidentified source, though manmade. P sues for recovery. Both fires were found to be proximate cause of the property damage. Court awards damages to P. D appeals. Since the both fires were manmade and the harm is indivisible, we have a joint action where defendant one will be held liable for everything. Important that the actions were both human initiated because a defendant cannot act jointly with a force of nature. If D’s fire joined a natural fire, P would not recover. Don’t know if the natural fire was the larger one, causing most of the damage so it would be unfair to hold D liable. In establishing causation, a “but-for” test will show that both D and unknown source acted jointly Thus, D is liable for entirety of damages.

* Alternative Liability - Indeterminate cause shifts burden of proof to defendants
  * When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm, and the plaintiff has introduced evidence that one of the two persons is responsible, D has the burden of proving that the other person was the sole cause of the harm, or liability should be imposed jointly. All tortfeasors must be before the court.
  * This is NOT a concert of action form of liability because only one defendant caused the harm
  * Fairness: Since the plaintiff is innocent and has been prevented from proving exact causation or to disestablish causation, we shift the burden to the tortfeasors to come forward and prove which defendant caused the injury
  * The plaintiff must still prove breach of a duty of care because he can only collect against tortfeasors
  * Restatement (Third) §28 - Burden of Proof
    > When P sues multiple actors and proves that each engaged in tortious conduct that exposed P to risk of harm and the conduct of at least one of them caused P's harm, P cannot reasonably be expected to prove which specific actor or actors caused the harm. The burden of proof on factual causation is shifted to the defendants

### *Summers v. Tice*
  
  D1 and D2 went hunting with P. Both shot in P’s direction at the same time and P was injured in the eye. It was impossible to know whether D1 or D2 caused the exact injury. Court rules that once we have established that both defendants have breached their duty of care, the burden shifts to them to disprove causation. Unless one of them does so, the are treated for the same purpose as joint tortfeasors

* Market Share Liability - Each manufacturer of a product causing injury s liable according to its market share
  * Rooted in logic as alternative liability - where as party cannot identify which of multiple defendants caused an injury, they are held jointly liable and burden of proof shifts to each defendant to demonstrate otherwise
  * Appropriate when a good is fungible and where it is impossible to determine who actually caused the injury
    * P must join enough manufacturers to have substantial share of market represented.
      * While 75-80% is the recommended amount, court only holds that the share be "substantial"
      * 51% - the rest of the market can be joined by Ds in additional cross compliant
      * If defendants represent unsubstantial market share, recoverable damages is limited to the market share represented
  * It is reasonable to measure the likelihood that a manufacture caused the injury in terms of the % of product that the manufacturer produces (i.e. market share)
  * Even if a D can demonstrate with evidence that, in a particular case, it was not responsible, courts do not permit such windfall exceptions and will nonetheless hold the manufacturer liable for the risk it exposed public to at the time
    * Economic vs. Corrective Justice approaches to tort law is very much present here
* Courts have been very reluctant to extend market share liability outside of drug cases
  * Found to be inapplicable in lead paint case due the fact that paint is not fungible - the level of lead in each manufacturers product may very significantly

### *Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories*

Drug, causes birth defects. Patient has no idea who manufacturer is because of mass production. Each and every manufacturer exposed a class of people, of which P is a part, to a risk of harm though only one actually created the risk to Sindell. Logical to group all the possible manufacturers together (like Ds in Tice). P sues all manufacturers for their portion of risk created, determined by market share. Rationale of Summers applies: between an innocent P and negligent Ds, Ds should bear the cost of the injury. This is only true, however, once it is shown that DES caused the injury. Unless a manufacturer can prove that it definitely did not cause the injury, each manufacturer. Pays according to market share.

* Loss of Chance
  * Recovery is allowed for decreased risk of survival. (damages proportional to reduced risk of survival)
    * Prevents malpractice defense asserting a patient was likely to die anyways, so negligence can't be seen as cause-in-fact.
    * D's conduct that increases the risk of death by decreasing the chances of survival (e.g. from 39% to 25%) is sufficient evidence to take the issue of proximate cause to the jury because actions forced the patient to lose chance of survival
    * Referenced in Restatement (Third) §26 Comment n.
  * Policy rationale - If don’t allow recovery for reduced risk, the medical profession wouldn’t have to give good care to anyone whose chance of survival was less than 50%

### *Falcon v. Memorial Hospital*

P gave birth, went into respiratory collapse from rare embolism, and died. Expert medical witness testified that if an intravenous line had been placed when complications became apparent, P would have had a 37.5 percent chance of surviving the embolism. Question for court was whether D can be held liable for malpractice due to failure to act even if doing so would have had a sub 50% of survival.  
Court held that reduction in survival odds must not be > 50% in order to be recoverable. Thus court ruled D could be held liable for up to 37.5% of the damages.

### *Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative*

D's negligence in diagnosing P's cancer led to a 14% decrease in her chance of survival. P sues for damages and D argues that P would was more likely to die anyway, so negligence wasn’t the cause. Court faced with determining whether P could recover for the lost opportunity for survival. Court ultimately permits recovery not for death, but for lost chance of survival. It is certainly more likely than not that negligence caused lost chance for survival, thus proportion of wrongful damages can be recovered.

### Proof of Factual Causation and Expert Testimony

* Frye Rule - Must be the case that the thing an expert is testifying to is consistent with consensus of the expert's field
  * If scientific finding has been “generally accepted” within field, it should be admitted
  * Justification - Juries have propensity to believe anything presented by someone who is supposed to represent authority, thus expert evidence needs to be screen somehow
  * Huber and "Junk Science" claims set the groundwork for shift in the standard of admissibility
* Daubert Standard - Expands role of judges as gatekeepers of evidence
  * Rejects Frye test of general acceptance, though general acceptance remains a consideration when making reliability inquiry
  * Relevance Inquiry
    * Is the testimony relevant? Will it assist the trier of fact?
  * Reliability Inquiry
    * Does the expert testimony consist of "scientific knowledge": Is it based on reliable data? Has technique/theory been tested? Has it been subject to peer review?
  * Abuse of Discretion Appellate Standard
    * Appealable, but as long as the admissibility decision isn't egregious and unreasonableness, deference will go to trial judge decision
  * Was extended to "technical" and "other specialized" forms of knowledge in Kumho Tire case
  * Became controlling standard in federal courts. States gradually started adopting Daubert over Frye, but some still apply general acceptance test alone
  * Shortcomings
    * Leaving decisions about admissibility to the discretion of judges in areas that far exceed their expertise and success of a case can be contingent on admissibility of expert testimony.

#### *General Electric Co. v. Joiner*

P worked as an electrician and was regularly exposed to hazardous substance (PCBs). P diagnosed with small cell lung cancer, which was claimed to be linked to P's exposure to PCBs. P had also been a smoker for 8 years, his parents smoked, and there was a history of lung cancer in his family. TC found for D, saying that Joiner’s experts didn’t show a causal link that was more than just mere speculation and that evidence was therefore inadmissible (Joiner had epidemiological studies that showed correlation but not causation and animal studies). CoA held that in determining whether the trial court erred in admitting or excluding scientific evidence, it should use abuse of discretion standard. Since CoA found no evidence of such abuse by TC, it ruled that it had the right to exclude expert evidence if there were gaps between the data offered and the expert's conclusion.

## Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)

* Even if factual causation has been proven, where should the line be drawn in the causal chain? Is the cause legally sufficient to support liability?
* What is the purpose of the requirement for proximate cause? Why isn't "but-for" cause alone sufficient?
  * Economic efficiency - incentivize avoiding foreseeable risk
    * Cannot guide behavior against unforeseeable consequences 
    * Puts liability on the cheaper cost avoider
  * Corrective Justice
    * Even statistically unlikely harm can happen, want to make P whole after suffering that harm
* Two types of tests:
  1. Directness Test—(backward-looking perspective)—Was plaintiff’s injury a direct result of defendant’s behavior or was there something that broke the chain of causation?  Where there any intervening causes in the chain of events?
  1. Foreseeability Test—(forward-looking perspective)—Was plaintiff’s type of harm a foreseeable result of defendant’s behavior—from time defendant acted?
     * Foreseeability was also involved in Duty/Breach, but foreseeability in Causation is different because it is individualized since it only relates to particular defendant, whereas foreseeability in Duty/Breach is related to society in general.
* Restatement (Second) - §431 What Constitutes Legal Cause
  * Actor's negligent conduct is a legal (proximate) cause of harm if:
    1. Conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm AND
    1. There is no rule of law relieving actor from liability to due the manner in which negligence results in harm
  * Comment a: Necessary, but not sufficient, that harm would not have occurred in the absence of actor's negligence. Must be substantial factor so as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause

### Limits on Causal Chain - Natural and Ordinary Result

* Failure to set limits to causality could conceivably result in a negligent party being liable for the destruction of human civilization. Where should limits be set?
  * Ryan court held the negligent party cannot be held liable for damages sustained by all sufferers because **the result for which party is liable must be natural/ordinary/anticipated results, rather than “concurrence of accidental circumstances” over which the party has no control over its effects**
    * Phrase "ordinary and natural result" must be construed with both intervening natural and human elements
  * "[T]he only inquiry in all these cases is whether the damage complained of is the natural reasonable result of the defendant's act" - Court's interpretation on the phrase "ordinary and natural result"
* Dependent Causes - Each of multiple successive acts is sufficient to harm P, but P is only exposed to the 2nd cause because of the negligence of the party causing the 1st
  * In these cases, the 2nd negligent defendant is typically only responsible for incremental damages.
* If P acts in good faith to mitigate the risk of loss from a dangerous situation caused by D, those actions do not sever causal connection
* Actions that occurs at/leading up to the injury that are pure coincidental, no way increasing the risk or hazard of the injury, are not causally connected to the harm

#### *Ryan v. NY Central RR*

One of D's engines set fire to a woodshed, which subsequently spreads to other houses including that of P which resided 150 feet away from the shed. Fundamental question the court must decide is the extent of D's liability. Court asserts that **a negligent party is liable for results that are natural/ordinary/anticipated, rather than “concurrence of accidental circumstances” over which the party has no control over its effects**. The court thus ruled that the result at issue (the damage to P's house) was too remote to constitute proximate cause. Remoteness of damage prohibits recovery by P.

#### *Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough*

 P was driver working on the line running from Wilkes-Barre, PA to D. P's company was governed by an ordinance stating that cars in D's streets couldn't travel above 8MPH. P drove under the tree , traveling in excess of 8MPH on windy night, and it fell, crushing the car and causing him injuries. P brought suit against the borough to recover for his injuries. The TC court awards him damages and D appeals, arguing speeding was cause of P's injuries. CoA holds that P’s own negligent driving did nothing to increase the risk of this particular harm, and is thus not a bar to his recovery. **A plaintiff’s contributory negligence that is not a proximate cause of his injury will not bar him from recovering for an injury occurring purely by chance**. This injury, the cause of which was entirely independent of P's driving speed, could have happened to a person driving at, below, or above the 8MPH limit. It doesn't matter that P violated the ordinance, the accident happened as a pure coincidence. Thus TC decision is affirmed.

### Liability for Conduct Creating Opportunity for 3rd Party Crime/Intentional Tort

* Earlier tests of proximate cause held the defendant liable only whn he was the "last wrongdoer" whose conduct contributed to the loss and that deliberate/malicious acts by a third party severed causal connection between D's negligence and the harm
  * **This is now seen as too restrictive and as creating perverse incentives** - D must not think about protection against 3rd party criminal conduct when determining reasonable care (e.g. a mechanic servicing your car could leave door unlocked and keys in ignition without facing any liability for negligence if the car is stolen)
* *Restatement (Second)* - §448/§449 Intentional Acts Done Under Opportunity Afforded By Actor's Negligence
  * Where a crime/intentional tort is a cause of harm dependent on actor's original negligent conduct, this conduct is viewed as a superseding cause (i.e. severs negligent actor's causal connection) unless negligent actor (should have) realized, at the time of its conduct, the likelihood of creating such opportunity for 3rd party to exploit. Risk of 3rd party committing harmful act created by actors conduct is part of the actor's negligence and does not prevent them from liability
* *Restatement (Third)* - §34 Intervening Acts and Superseding Causes
  * Actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from risks made by actor's tortious conduct

#### *Brower v. NY Central  RR*

P was operating a horse-drawn wagon hauling barrels for his employer. The wagon was struck by a train operated by D, killing the horse, destroying the wagon, and scattering the barrels everywhere. The impact left P completely stunned and unaware of what was going on around him, at which point thieves stole the loot. D employed two engineers to prevent theft by thieves, but P was unable to fend off the thieves due to his condition after the accident. P brought suit against the railroad for damages based on his injuries and the stolen cargo. Court found D liable for the stolen property because the fact that thieves may steal property after railroad accidents is a foreseeable consequence of such accidents. **When a defendant’s negligence causes injury to a plaintiff, but the plaintiff’s injuries are made worse by the foreseeable, concurrent action of a third party which is not the proximate cause of the injuries, the defendant is also liable for the extent of damage caused by the third party. However, D will only be liable if the third party’s actions are foreseeable as a natural and probably consequence of the defendant’s negligence**. The fact that cargo in an accident could be stolen by thieves should have been foreseeable to D and is reflected in its own conduct (i.e. hiring individuals to protect against bandits). Thus, even though bandits were responsible for the theft, D is liable because the theft was the natural and reasonably forseeable consequence of its own negligence. Dissent: D is not last culpable human actor—negligence only provided the opportunity for the crime, but not the cause ("last wrongdoer" approach).

### Rescue Doctrine

* To achieve rescuer status, must demonstrate:
  1. D was negligent and caused peril (or appearance thereof) to the person being rescued
  1. Peril (or appearance thereof) was imminent
  1. Reasonably prudent person would conclude such peril existed
  1. Rescuer acted with reasonable care in attempting Rescue
* D may not be liable for injuries to the rescuer, however, if the rescuer acted foolishly, negligently, or without regard for his own safety (though this should be viewed as CN and not superseding cause).
* Economic justification: Courts effectively subsidize rescue attempt by relieving rescuer of liability over injuries they may sustain when making reasonable attempt to rescue. This presents societal benefits.

#### *Wagner v. International Ry.*

P and cousin  boarded a train operated by D. The two stood on the platform of the train where conductor had failed to close platform doors. Cousin thrown out of the car. P gets off and walks across the bridge, hoping to find his cousin’s body. P alleges that the train’s conductor invited him to do so, and even followed him with a torch. P loses his footing on bridge and falls. D was sued for injuries resulting to both the cousin and to P in attempting to rescue his cousin. **A defendant who negligently imperils and causes injury to a person may also be liable for injuries suffered by a third party in attempting to rescue that person, provided the rescuer’s actions were reasonable given the circumstances**. If the railroad negligently imperiled P's cousin, it was foreseeable that P (or another passenger) might go to his rescue. **Danger invites rescue**, and thus the rescuer’s actions are a natural consequence of the initial harm.

### Directness Test

* Classic directness test - Once breach of duty has been established, Court held D liable for all direct consequences whether or not they were reasonably foreseeable. Hence, foreseeability is immaterial when determining proximate cause.
  * Foreseeability is material only to determining breach of duty, not to whether it is a proximate cause of the damage. That is the role of the directness test
  * Criticism: If risk is unforeseeable, threat of liability won't deter/alter the behavior. Unforeseeable consequences can't be factored into a cost/benefit analysis.

#### *In re Polemis & Furness, Withy & Co.*

D chartered ship from plaintiff to transport cargo. During unloading of a ship, one of the crew members dropped a heavy plank into ship's hold, which caused a spark and an explosion that wrecked the ship. Arbitrators found that the damage to the boat was not reasonably foreseeable, but was nonetheless caused by the crew member's negligence. Court upholds the arbitrators ruling, holding that **harm that is a direct consequence of negligence does not have to be foreseeable to be actionable**. The falling plank caused by D's crew member was a negligent act because *some* damage to the ship could be reasonably anticipated. The fact that the negligent act was the direct cause of the explosion is sufficient to hold D liable, regardless of whether the extent of the damage could be reasonably anticipated.

### Foreseeability Test

* Court in *Wagon Mound No. 1* rejects directness test in favor of foreseeability. Damages are limited to foreseeable consequences of a negligent act
  * Court asserts directness test is unfair to D because it exposes them to potentially limitless liability so long as the consequences are "direct"
  * Foreseeability test is more just, as demanding more of a person requires him to prevent acts he cannot possibly expect to occur, and demanding less ignores the minimum standards of behavior appropriate in civil society
  * The time period for determining whether an act is “reasonably foreseeable” should be at the moment of the negligent act, as everyone has perfect knowledge in hindsight and all consequences which actually occur can be said to have been "foreseeable". So long as the type of harm is foreseeable, it does not matter how the foreseeable harm manifests
* Australian court rules in favor of another P (*Wagon Mound No. 2*) who sustained damage to ship in same series of events as *Wagon Mound No. 1*
  * Same foreseeability test applied, but this time D held liable
  * Difference an outcome suggests underlying policy rationale: that of placing liability on the least cost avoider. Ps in first case were in better position to avoid damage then those in the second.
* Harm within the Risk
  * Cardozo narrows foreseeability in *Palsgraf*
  * Determines whether the victim was in foreseeable range of those harmed by an action and whether it was reasonably forseeable that an action risk harm to that particular class of persons
  * Under this formulation, when a D outside the class of people to which harm is reasonably foreseeable (i.e. those to whom no duty is owed) is harmed, P is not liable

#### *Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Mort's Dock & Engineering Co., Ltd. (Wagon Mound No. 1)*

P owned a wharf upon which it performed repair work on other ships. A ship owned by D was docked at a neighboring wharf. One of P's ships leaked oil into the harbor and spread to P's wharf, requiring P to stop repair work. P is informed by 3rd party that oil not flammable and work proceeds. Wharf ultimately goes up in flames. P sues and TC judge found that D did (and could) not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being caught on fire when spread over the surface of water. CoA rules **a defendant is only liable for the consequences flowing from his negligent act that are foreseeable to a reasonable person at the time of the negligent act**. Since at the time of D's negligent act of leaking oil, it did (and could) not know that the oil could catch fire when spread out over water, the damage to P's wharf was not a reasonably forseeable consequence. Hence, D not held liable.

#### *Palsgraf v. Long Island RR*

P was standing on a platform owned by railroad company, D. While P is waiting for train, two men running to catch another moving train successfully board with assistance from D employees. While attempting to pull one of the men onto the moving train, a package he was carrying (containing fireworks) to fall and explode, causing the platform to dislodge and injure P. P brought suit against the railroad for negligence. TC granted judgment for P, and intermediate CoA affirmed. D appealed. Court holds that D is not liable for P's injuries because P's injuries were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of any possible negligence by the railroad. D is **only liable for negligent conduct if the resulting harm was reasonably foreseeable**. D is only liable for negligence if he owes a legal duty to the plaintiff and breaches that duty, and if the resulting harm was reasonably foreseeable. In this case, neither of those elements are satisfied. Dissent applies the directness test, holding the employees pulling the men on board and allowing the package to fall initiated a direct causal chain that resulted in the injury.

#### *Marshall v. Nugent*

D1's truck cut corner as it rounded a curve, forcing P’s car off the roadway. As P was about to re-enter road, car driven by D2 saw his path was obstructed by D1's stopped truck and attempted to stop vehicle. D's car began to skid, hit both a plank fence and P, resulting in injuries to P. P sues both D1 and D2 and D2 brings cross claim against D1. TC awards judgement in favor of both P and D2. D1 appeals, arguing it was not proximate cause of P's injury. Court holds that D1 was indeed proximate cause of P's injury. **A defendant’s negligent conduct may be the proximate cause of injuries occurring to a plaintiff after the actual negligent conduct if the risk of those injuries is a foreseeable consequence of the negligent conduct**. Thus, D1 was proximate cause of P’s harm because injury to P occurred while still dealing with “fallout” from P1's initial negligence.

### Psyschological Harms

* Courts have been somewhat reluctant to award damages
  * To the extent they do allow it, there is require for physical manifestation
* From economic standpoint
  * No good incentive to disallow when causal chain is clear
