# Strict Liability

## Class Notes from Introduction

* Certain damages are designated to have categorical liability
  * Irrespective of the circumstances or intent
* Provides cost effectiveness and administrative expedience
  * If 99 times out of 100, a breach of duty will fail cost/benefit analysis, designating it as strictly liable saves time and resources that would be used to make that determination

## Trespass to Chattels and Conversion

### Intel Corp v. Hamidi

* Requirement to constitute trespass is intrusion must impact the integrity or availability of the chattel

### Poggi v. Scott

Who tf knows

### Moore v. Regents of the University of California

Commercial use of a patient’s blood or tissue products does not constitute conversion because, once extracted, such products are statutorily no longer the property of the patient.

## Animals

* If animal has previously shown signs of aggression, treated same as undomesticated animal for purpose of strict liability
* Some dog breeds that fall into the strict liability category due to aggressive nature (e.g. pitbulls)

## Abnormally Dangerous Activities

* Restatement (Second) §519 - General Principle
  1. One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person for harm to the person, land, or chattels of another resulting from activity, even though they exercised utmost care to prevent harm
  1. Strict liability is limited to the types of harms that make the activity abnormally dangerous
* Restatement (Second) §520 - Abnormally Dangerous Activities
  * Factors to be considered in determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous:
    1. existence of high risk of some harm to person, land, or chattel of others
    1. likelihood that the harm that results will be great
    1. inability to eliminate risk by the exercise of reasonable care
    1. extent to which activity is not common
    1. inappropriateness of activity to place where it is conducted
    1. extent to which value to community is outweighed by dangerous attributes of activity
* Restatement (Second) §522
  * Engaged in abnormally dangerous activity, liable for harms under § 519 even if harm is caused by a) unexpected, innocent, reckless or negligent third person, or b) action of an animal, or c) operation of a force of nature. 
* Restatement (Second) §523
  * Assumption of risk of harm bars recovery even in cases of abnormally dangerous (AD) activity. (allowed to assume risk of such dangerous activity)
* Restatement (Second) § 524
  * CN of plaintiff is not a defense to SL for one who engages in AD behavior. But Plaintiff’s CN in knowingly and unreasonably
  * No SL for AD behavior. if harm wouldn’t have occurred but for the abnormally sensitive character of the plaintiff’s activity. 
* Pervasiveness of a particular behavior can serve as a proxy for its social value
  * An activity will not be widespread if not socially valuable

* When the hazard of an activity can be avoided by being careful (i.e., non negligent), there is no need for a switch from the baseline tort regime of negligence to one of strict liability

### [*Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanamid Co.*][Indiana Harbor]

Chemical manufacturer (D) loaded hazardous chemical onto the train car. A train picked up the car, some of it leaked on the wayP spent $981,000 on decontamination measures and sued D to recovery these damages alleging negligent maintenance of the car and  maintained that transport of the chemical was an AD activity for which D  should be SL. TC held for P on the SL count. D appealed. Court (Posner) balances factors in the restatement and holds damage was caused by negligence D was not strictly liable for 2 reasons. (1) Damage caused wasn't the result of the chemical's hazardous nature, but the lack of due care by the party transporting. Manufacturer is severely limited in what they can do to mitigate the risks associated with transport. Coase perspective - Transporter is the least cost avoider. (2) Negligence is adequate to deal with these cases and will efficiently induce reasonable care - no need for SL. Unnecessarily imposing requirement for P to do more than exercise reasonable care would be excessively costly (i.e. discourages transportation of chemicals).

### Private Nuisances

* Spite Fences

* Restatement (Second) §821 - Significant Harm
  * > There is liability for a nuisance only to those to whom it causes significant harm, of a kind that would be suffered by a normal person in the community or by property in normal condition.
  

#### *Fontainebleau v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five*

Plaintiff sued for right to sunlight for its hotel—defendant’s building was obstructing light. Court rules that there is no legal right to free flow of light and air. Additionally, court asserted it is universally held that where a structure serves a useful and beneficial purpose, it does not give rise to cause of action.

#### *Rogers v. Elliott*

Defendant was custodian of church and rang large bell everyday.  It caused convulsions to the plaintiff.  The defendant refused to stop ringing it and the plaintiff thus sued for injunction. Court asserts the standard for determining a private nuisance must be the discomfort or harm it would cause a person of ordinary sensibilities. The court rules for the defendant based upon a reasonable person standard—no injunction for extra-sensitivity. Someone with circumstances beyond those of a person of ordinary sensibilities faces the burden of avoiding any harm that may result.

#### Ensign v. Walls

Defendant’s property emitted offensive orders, was manifested with rats and flies, dogs barged constantly and escaped and roamed around the neighborhood.  Plaintiff sued for an injunction. Court held the fact that an alleged nuisance existed long before those objecting to it moved into the vicinity does not necessarily prevent a court from ordering it abated. Hence court rejects "coming to the Nuisance" as a categorical defense. Minority view rests on P's assumption of the risk when acquiring the property.
