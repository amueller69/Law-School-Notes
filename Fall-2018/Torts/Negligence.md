# Chapter 3 - Negligence

## Medical Malpractice

* Medical issues are treated uniquely based on the assumption that jurors are not capable of identifying a duty and determining whether it was satisfied.
  * Courts heavily rely on custom, relying on expert consensus/testimony to determine standard of care.
  * Over time, the standard of care shifted from one based on the locality to a national one.
    * Presents some potential difficulties, namely that disparities in knowledge, resources, and technology among providers make it very challenging for certain a consistent national standard of care.
    * This shift has help combat the biases in favor of medical personnel. It also better enables patients to weigh the convenience of local care vs risks or inadequate care, as a physician must inform patients of limitations in facilities and capabilities prior to treatment. However, the communication of this risk isn't always efficient.

### Lama v. Boras

**Facts**:
Doctor finds that plaintiff has herniated disk. She doesnâ€™t prescribe absolute bed rest as is typically prescribed before the operation. There were significant post surgical complications because adequate pre-operation precautions were not ordered. No-antibiotics had been prescribed, pre or post-operation. Patient brings suit claiming doctor was negligent in four areas: failure to provide proper conservative medical treatment, premature and improper discharge, negligent performance of surgery, and failure to provide proper management for the infection.

**Ruling**:
In order to establish medical malpractice, patient must demonstrate:

1. The basic norms of care applicable to physicians or specialists
2. Proof the medical personnel failed to follow the basic norms
3. Causal relation between failing to follow the norm and the harm to patient
