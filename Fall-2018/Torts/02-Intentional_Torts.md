# Intentional Torts

## Physical Harms

### Battery

* **Intent** to cause contact and substantial certainty that act will cause contact
  * Single intent approach:
    * Single intent is simply the intent to make contact
    * Section 102 of the *Third Restatement*: Intent required for battery is intent to cause contact, whether or not harm or offense was intended.
    * Offers more protection to plaintiffs bodily interest, as one can still be liable even if they reasonably believe the contact would not cause harm.
  * Dual intent approach
    * Dual intent is the intent to make contact that is harmful or offensive.
    * Section 14 of the *Second Restatement*: an individual is liable for battery if he is intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with a person and the harmful contact results
    * Consistent with view that liability for battery should only exist when actor meets certain threshold of culpability that is greater than strict liability.
  * Transferred Intent Principle
    * If A intends to hit B and hits C by mistake,the intent meant for B is transferred to C—since we now have intent and hit, A is liable for battery caused to C

#### [*Vosberg v. Putney*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibc1af9ec002711dabf60c1d57ebc853e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

Once defendant has committed a wrongful, he is liable for all harms resulting regardless of whether they were foreseeable or intended. Intent to kick is enough for liability, no need for intent to hurt to the extent that resulted. The theory that damages recoverable should be commensurate to the level of forseeable harm was rejected by the court

### Trespass to Land

* Violation of an individuals exclusive possession of property
* The controlling intent in trespass cases is the intent to complete the physical act, not the intent to harm. The act is wrongful/unlawful in itself
* Damages are not required in trespass. Every unauthorized entry onto the land of another is a trespass regardless of the amount of damages
* Intangible trespasses
  * Things like external noises and scents that approach an individual's property
  * Non-physical intrusions may gave rise to trespass claims but only if one can prove both intent and physical damage

#### [*Dougherty v. Stepp*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ie747226404c811da9439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

D entered P’s land to survey part of it but did not cause damages. Judgment for P because tort is a volitional act regard of harm caused. Every unauthorized entry onto an other's property is a trespass and for every such entry the law infers some damages, even if the harm was negligible

### Consensual Defense to Intentional Torts

* Defense to liability on grounds that tortfeasor was given consent, implicit or explicit, to perform an act from which the alleged damage resulted
  * A strong defense because it is grounded in the principle of autonomy
* Implied consent
  * Individual is aware of the harms that are likely or regularly occur in the course of an action, yet choses to proceed with it can be viewed as a consent
  * In some medical cases, court has acknowledged that conditions discovered during internal operations cannot be consented to due to patient's incapacitation. Thus, the court, under the assumption that a rational agent would consent, will permit extension of an operation as dictated by the doctor's professional expertise.
* Majority view asserts that one cannot consent to an unlawful act out of principle..
  * Raises questions about private actions for damages arising out of criminal activity and whether it incentivizes or deters this activity.
* **Exceptions**: Cases where consent was the result of fraud, misrepresentation, or undue duress.

#### [*Mohr v. Williams*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I3e932dfa01f111da8ac8f235252e36df/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P sustains injury to left ear during operation of on right ear despite not consenting to any additional procedures. Court ruled that the operation was performed without consent or circumstances that would override the need for consent, hence it was unlawful. Since unlawful contact with person constitutes battery, D is liable for technical battery. However, the court states that the amount to recovery P is entitled to is not clear and instructed that the circumstances must be taken into account by trial court. *(Note: D's liability for the harm depend on the theory of intent applied by the court. D might not be liable under dual-intent approach because contact was not intended to be harmful)*

#### [*Hudson v. Craft*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I01afc44bfad311d9bf60c1d57ebc853e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P, a minor, is injured in an unlicensed (illegal) boxing match. Despite the fact that P consented, a statue intended a class of people by deeming an act illegal, cannot be consented to. Thus, the court finds that D, the fight promoter, was liable.

### Mental Disability as a Defense to Intentional Torts

* An insane person is liable in tort for damages caused when he or she:
  1. Was capable of entertaining intent to commit harmful/unlawful act
  2. Did in fact entertain that intent
  3. Acted upon that intent
* Justification for liability
  * Economic Incentives - Incentivize guardians of disabled person to exercise better care so as to minimize the harm done. Also deters usage of insanity as a pretense.

#### [*McGuire v. Almy*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia6e361e0ce5211d983e7e9deff98dc6f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

In the midst of a tantrum, with threats to do harm and actual violence, P goes into room to take a stick away from D. P fails and gets hurt. Applying the general rule, D was held liable, as she was capable of entertaining and acting on intent to harm. P's intervention cannot be viewed as implied consent, as she was responding to an emergency situation and not acting voluntarily.

### Defense of Property and Self

* Self-Defense
  * In most cases of intentional harms (i.e. trespass, conversion), risk of an innocent mistake falls on individual making it.
    * Assault/battery seems to be the exception
    * Restatement (Second) states accidental harm of an innocent third party is only actionable if the actor realizes or should realize risk of causing such harm is unreasonable.
  * This defense is much stronger when the plaintiff has already assaulted the defendant
    * Stand your ground laws have been adopted in several states
  * The self-defense privilege extends to intervening third-parties to the same extent that they are privileged to defend themselves if they reasonably believe that they are entitled to force and that it is necessary to protect the party (RST Sec. 76)
* Defense of property
  * Generally require some notice to be provided to potential trespassers, which serves as the functional equivalent of self-defense requirements.
  * Restatement (Second) - An actor is privileged to use a device likely to cause serious body harm for the purpose of protecting his land from intrusion to the extent that he would privileged to prevent/terminate harm were he present.
  * Posner - Requirement to provide notice established in Holbrook is "ingenious" because it balances protection of property and cost of maintaining domestic animals, as uncertainty surrounding presence of defense mechanisms would deter individuals pursuing animals anytime they strayed onto someone elses land.

#### [*Courvoisier v. Raymond*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia68182a3f85e11d99439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

D fires weapon to scare off group of individuals attempting to break into jewelry store that occupies space below his apartment. Gunshots attracts P, who identifies himself as an officer and commands him to to stop shooting. P is mistakenly shot while rushing towards D. Court asserts that in order to determine of self-defense was justified, it must consider whether circumstances would lead reasonable person to believe their life was in danger or there was a threat of great physical harm posed by P. The court found that behavior of the burglars, along with the darkness preventing D from being able to distinguish D, is sufficient justification and hence the mistake is excusable.

#### [Bird v. Holbrook]

Case from England where D set up spring gun in walled garden to catch thieves from removing valuable tulips. P enters garden chasing after peacock and triggers the spring gun, sustaining serious injuries. Court recognized legitimate social value of allowing D to protect property, though P's action in attempt to recover his property also had value. Further, intent of spring gun seemed to exceed deterrence, as D was trying to lure and injure a potential thief. Hence, D's action was not proportional threat posed by property. Court ruled that notice to property dwellers must be provided if these countermeasures are resorted to.

### Necessity

* Entry upon land is justified out of necessity
  * Goods in danger of destruction
  * Lives at risk
  * Forces outside of individual's control
* General common law rule of necessity is that owner of property may not resist entry out of conditions of necessity, but have no legal obligation to facilitate such entry or provide assistance
* Incomplete Necessity
  * In taking private property for the purpose of preservation out of necessity, any damage that results to that property is still compensable
  * This may incentivize individuals to take extra precautions to completely avoid these circumstances without completely barring them from avoiding significant damages when they do arise.
  * This contrasts with self-dense and public necessity (property is damage out of necessity to prevent harm to public), which don't entail just compensation.
* Economic justification for doctrine of necessity - Aside from the preservation of valuable goods and human lives that may come at a small price, it prevents extortion by property owners who deny entry onto land out of necessity unless individual pays some exorbitantly large sum

#### [*Ploof v. Putnam*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I9668b0f9331a11d98b61a35269fc5f88/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P sues for damages caused when D denied him use of his dock for safety during a storm. This lead to damage of P's boat and injury to members of P's family were on board. D held responsible because D would not allow plaintiff to use D’s property to avoid injury out of necessity.

#### [*Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ifa238d7a001811dab386b232635db992/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

 D’s ship was unloading at P’s dock. Storm hit preventing D from exiting harbor. D called for tugs, but there were none so they secured the ship to P’s dock, replacing lines as they snapped during the storm. Meanwhile, ship was bumping up against dock, doing $500 damage. The court found the damage didn't arise out of any negligence, as an ordinary level of care was exercised out of necessity. However, it cannot be said that the damage was completely out of D's control and was simply the result of an act of God. Securing the boat to the dock, though done out of necessity to prevent damage to the more valuable ship, was intentional. Hence, P is entitled to compensation. Dissent contends that if P exercised requisite level of care, then he can't be faulted and the risk of such an occurrence is an inherent to owning the dock.

## Emotional and Dignitary Harms

* **Challenges with Torts for Emotional and Dignitary Harm**:
  * How can we quantify the damages and measure and appropriate policy response?
    * Courts are uncomfortable with the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, not because they fail to recognize the harm,but because of the consequences in setting precedent
    * Expectations in response to a rule, which will affect people's behavior and hence welfare, is the focus of the Law/Economics approach, not remedying at an individual case level.

## Assault

* Assault
  * A plaintiff may recover damages for an act which causes her to fear of an actual harm or threat of a harm—Imminent Harm—even though she suffers no physical injury
* Restatement (Second) on Torts
  * §21 - An actor is subject to liability to another for assault if he acts intending to cause a harmful contact with that person…or an imminent apprehension of such contact AND the other is thereby put in such imminent apprehension
  * §24 - In order that the other may be put in the apprehension necessary to make the actor liable for an assault, the other must believe that the act may result in imminent contact unless prevented from so resulting by the other's self-defensive action or by his flight or by the intervention of some outside force.
  * §24 Comment b - Not necessary that the victim believe the act will be effective in inflicting the intended injury in order to constitute an actionable assault.  Therefore, a victim may have apprehension—feel threatened but know he can easily prevent the threatened harm by self-defense—and still recover for an actionable assault

### *Tuberville v. Savage*

A threatening gesture will not constitute an emotional assault when there are accompanying words that clearly negate the gesture’s threat.No imminent harm because no judges were present when D said “I would take out my sword if the judges were here.”

## Offensive Battery

* Offensive Battery
  * An act which causes great indignity and provokes retaliation by force is an offensive battery that compels an award of liberal damages.
  * Insult is more to be considered than the actual damage, as though there is no great bodily pain, it is clearly within the definition of battery
  * Restatement (3rd) of Torts §3- Battery: Definition of Offensive Contact:
    >  A contact is offensive within the meaning of § 1(c)(ii) if:
    > (a) the contact is offensive to a reasonable sense of personal dignity; or
    > (b) the contact is highly offensive to the other's unusually sensitive sense of personal dignity, and the actor knows that the contact will be highly offensive to the other.

### [*Alcorn v. Mitchell*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iaf112ef2cebd11d9a489ee624f1f6e1a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

At conclusion of a trial, the plaintiff at the trial spit at the defendant after having lost an appeal. Damage was offense to dignity. Man spit upon sued-he was insulted in public by the spitter's malicious act. Court awards damages

## False Imprisonment

* If individual is restrained in his personal freedom of movement out of some improper process (e.g. fear of personal harm, physical detainment), they have been falsely imprisoned
* So long as plaintiff has an available way out, false imprisonment cannot be brought
* Courts face difficulty of balancing a plaintiff freedom from being falsely imprisoned and a defendant's interest in taking reasonable steps to defend persons or property. In doing so, courts consider:
  * Individuals need to protect persons or property in his charge
  * The manner, place, and circumstances of the occurrence
  * Practicality of any alternative courses of action
* Criterion for determination of probable cause is an objective one
  * If it was a subjective one, individual could be detained at the whims of another's inarticulate hunches without any regard to discernable fact
  * Defense on grounds that their was probable cause must demonstrate detainment was: conducted in a reasonable manner, for no more than a reasonable time length, by an authorized individual, with reasonable grounds for belief of detainee's violation of property/person.

### [*Coblyn v. Kennedy’s, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22e8c055ee7a11d9b386b232635db992/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

Old man was unreasonably detained by store’s employee for shoplifting. He is innocent, and suffers a heart attack out of fear. He sues for false imprisonment. CoA affirms judgement in his favor, holding it was not reasonable to use such force under the circumstances.

## Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

* Conduct must be extreme or outrageous – Some say this is the most fundamental element, most often determining whether someone’s held liable
  * Objective test: Would people in the community think this is extreme/outrageous
* Conduct must cause injury
  * Conduct causes emotional/mental damage of a very serious kind, often to the extent where it is accompanied by physical harm
  * Some courts require high standard of proximity
* Restatement (Second) §46 – Outrageous Conduct Causing Severe Emotional Distress
  > 1. One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.
  > 2. Where such conduct is directed at a third person, the actor is subject to liability if he intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress
  >    * (a) to a member of such person's immediate family who is present at the time, whether or not such distress results in bodily harm, or
  >    * (b) to any other person who is present at the time, if such distress results in bodily harm.
* Parasitic Damages
  * Emotional or Physical damages, which typically arise out of an existing wrong, raise questions about whether IIED warrants an independent tort.
* Function of IIED
  * Deters individuals from acting recklessly, especially those prone to outrageous behavior
  * Fills gap in law where individual dignity isn't covered by torts of Assault and Battery
  * Use of punitive damages both deters and affirms societal values which deem certain behaviors unacceptable

### *Wilkinson v. Downton*

The defendant jokingly calls plaintiff to convey that her husband has been severely injured in an accident. She goes into nervous shock, experiences vomiting, etc. Plaintiff sues for IIED. Court awards damages, ruling the action was calculated to cause physical harm to plaintiff, an ordinary person could have suffered like P did, effects of D’s acts were not too remote.
