# Affirmative Duties

## Duty to Rescue

* Big picture question: How does this affect our approach to law and economics that views rules through effificency framework?
  * If an affirmative duty is passes cost/benefit analysis, what justification is there for not compelling individuals to perform these duties?
  * Does this cause the efficiency analysis to fall apart?
* As a general matter, individuals do not owe affirmative duties

### *Bush v. Armory Manufacturing Co.*

* Child trespassed onto defendant’s mill to see his brother. Defendant told boy to leave but child didn’t understand English. Boy crushed his hand in machinery
* Court effective asserts that a landowner has no duty to warn a trespasser of the existence of a dangerous condition or object even if the trespasser is a mere child. Duty to rescue is only a moral duty, not a legal duty
  * "Spring Gun" cases establishes that intentionally inflicting harm as a countermeasure to trespassing without notice is not a defense to liability, there is not duty to mitigate risk of unintentional harm

### *Hurley v. Eddingfield*

D is violently ill and on the verge of death. D is approached, informed of P's condition, and requested to provide care (for a fee) as no other physician was procurable at the time. D doesn't provide care and P subsequently dies. Court holds that such an act would have been a preventative, not a compulsive, measure. In obtaining license to practice medicine, the state does not require licensee to practice on any other terms than those that he should chose. While there may have been a moral or professional obligation to render aid, there was not a legal one therefore D cannot be held liable.

* Historical Categorization of Duties on Landowners
  1. Invitee—Someone expressly invited onto property for business purposes
     * Highest level of duty owed
  1. Licensee/Social Guest—Someone invited onto land as a friend who is not receiving a joint benefit as in a business setting.
     * Moderate level of duty owed—duty to warn f concealed dangers but not to inspect for dangers
  1. Trespasser—Person who enters property without authorization
     * No duty owed to person except not to engage in willful conduct toward them or in the case of an attractive nuisance

* Ad-hoc statutes granting immunity to "recreational lands" such as national/state parks

## Special Relationships

* Not exempt from affirmative duties do to the special nature of the relationship with the harmed individual
  * Tenant-Landlord, Patient-Health Provider, etc.
  * Arises out of the individuals unique or superior ability to protect another individual in areas where they are unable to help themselves

### *Kline v. 1500 Massachusetts Ave. Apt.*

D gets robbed and assaulted in the hallway of her building and suffered personal injuries. She sues landlord for negligence. TC dismissed. P appeals. CoA assert that general rule which exonerates a third party from protecting another from a criminal attack is not applicable to the landlord/tenant relationship in multiple dwelling homes. Landlord has a duty to tenant that arises out of their special relationship. Since landlord is the only one who can take the necessary acts to insure safety, he is obligated to minimize the risks—in this case risks were foreseeable. Contracts wouldn’t protect the tenant because of unequal bargaining power. Tort duty is necessary to protect the tenant who can’t help herself. Duty is created from the landlord’s superior ability to control the risk, and his special relationship with tenant
