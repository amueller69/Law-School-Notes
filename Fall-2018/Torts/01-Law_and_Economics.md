# Introduction to Law and Economics Approach to Torts

## Torts

* Regulatory mechanism/tool that is enforced privately (i.e. private actors initiate tort actions)
* Compensatory system allowing relief/recovery for wronged individuals
* Criticism of tort system in the US
  * Slow, unpredictable, and expensive
    * Part of the unpredictability is due to ambiguity in the conflicts and absence of a clear rule or standard
    * In face of this ambiguity, disputes might best be resolved through deference to a jury, allowing democratic enforcement of norms

## Law and Economics

* Law and Economics approach has been the dominant framework in tort law since the 1970's
* Tort rules function as a mechanism for internalizing externalities
  * Awarding tort damages can be viewed as a Pigouvian tax, applied after the fact, intended to disincentivize certain actions
* Goal of Law and Economics approach is to maximize efficiency
  * To achieve efficiency is to  maximize net surplus/welfare. Economists have used several formulations of this term throughout the last century
    * Pareto Efficiency: At least 1 person is better off , nobody is worse off
    * Hicks-Kaldor Efficiency: Gains to winners are large enough to compensate losers
    * Allocative Efficiency: Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost
* Elements of economically efficient approach present pre-20th century
  * O.W. Holmes argued for letting the costs of an accident fall where they may unless there is come clear societal benefit in shifting them
  * However, administrative efficiency is only one aspect of the broader concept of economic efficiency
* Transaction costs are critical to economic analysis
  * Costs involved in establishing and enforcing property rights/contractual arrangements
  * In contract law, courts/lawmakers can reduce transactions cost ex ante through standardized "gap-filling". However, tort rule can only govern liability after the harm has occurred
* Economically efficient framework can be contrasted by one that prioritizes corrective justice
  * Sees tort law as providing rectification or redress for an invasion of a legal right
  * Modern formulations stress view that purpose of law is solely a matter of fairness in resolving disputes between parties and undoing imbalances created by violation of a preexisting right
  * Long term incentives are viewed as extrinsic to the basic purpose of law

## Coase Theorem

* If there are no transaction costs, the efficient outcome will occur regardless (or in spite) of the legal rule
  * Regardless of whom the law gives the entitlement, the same efficient will result
* If there are positive transaction costs, the efficient outcome may not occur under every legal rule. In these circumstances, the preferred legal rule is the one minimizing the effects of transaction costs
* Emphasis distinction between property rights and liability rules, which often coexist in same resource
  * Property rights are exclusive rights that can't be confiscated involuntarily. Remedies for enforcing protection of these rights are intended to deter/prevent violation (e.g. enjoinders, punitive damages)
  * Liability rules provide right to claim damages for injury to a resource, but no right to exclude. Remedies are compensatory
  * Liability rules allow involuntary transfer of resources through the courts since injurer has right to inflict harm if willing to pay the cost. Transfer of property rights can only occur through voluntary bargaining at the market level
  * If voluntary market transaction costs are low, they are economically preferable than the liability/court transaction approach since markets are more reliable registers of value. If these same costs are high, property approach is inferior because optimal use is prevented
* Railroad-Farmer Example:
  * Railroad profits and crop damage where x = # of trains, R(x) is railroad profit as a function of x, and D(x) is crop damage as a function of x

      | x | R(x) | R\`(x) | D(x) | D\`(x) | R-D |
      |---|------|--------|------|--------|-----|
      | 1 | 3.50 |   3    | 0.50 |   1    |  3  |
      | 2 | 6.00 |   2    | 2.00 |   2    |  4  |
      | 3 | 7.50 |   1    | 4.50 |   3    |  3  |
      | 4 | 8.00 |   0    | 8.00 |   4    |  0  |
      | 5 | 7.50 |  -1    |12.50 |   5    | -5  |
      | 6 | 6.00 |  -2    |18.00 |   6    | -12 |

  * In world where transaction costs are high and RR decides to accept liability of crop damage, profit maximizing output (where MB = MC) would result in RR running 2 trains per day.
  * However, if transaction cost were zero, the same efficient level of output would result, even if the RR faced no liability for damage to crops
    * Assume F gross profits are $10 and RR has right to run trains without liability
    * Profit maximizing level of output for RR is 4 trains per day, resulting in $8 in crop damage costs incurred by F (net profit of $2)
    * F would be willing to offer up to $6 dollars for RR to reduce output to 2 trains and be better off (net profit >=$2)
    * RR would accept bargain since it would be better off as well (net profit >$8)
    * Bargaining skills of parties would determine exact amount paid by F to RR, though profit maximizing price in the aggregate would be $3
  * Even we assume there are alternative ways to mitigate crop damage, such as planting spark resistant crops, a similar transfer would be made. The cheapest method of avoiding the cost will be selected, regardless of who actually incurs it
* Assumption of zero transaction costs is obviously never reflected in the real world
  * Whenever transaction costs are lower than the gains from transacting, there will not result an externality
  * In these cases, voluntary transactions of property rights will lead to efficiency while being cheaper to administer than the legal system
  * Courts/Lawmakers must determine which approach brings closer to the optimal result (i.e. that of a "perfect)
* Coase's theorem has no room for normative judgements, thus it indifferent about which party actually bears the cost. Giving injurer right to create risk or injured right to be free from risk affects the distribution of wealth
