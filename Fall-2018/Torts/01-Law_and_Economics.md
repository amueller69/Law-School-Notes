# Introduction to Law and Economics Approach to Torts

## Torts

* Regulatory mechanism/tool that is enforced privately (i.e. private actors initiate tort actions)
* Compensatory system allowing relief/recovery for wronged individuals
* Criticism of tort system in the US
  * Slow, unpredictable, and expensive
    * Part of the unpredictability is due to ambiguity in the conflicts and absence of a clear rule or standard
    * In face of this ambiguity, disputes might best be resolved through deference to a jury, allowing democratic enforcement of norms

## Law and Economics

* Law and Economics approach has been the dominant framework in tort law since the 1970's
* Posner - Hypothesis is that the rules governing tort liability are best explained as efforts to minimize social costs
  * **Positive Analysis** is even in the title
  * This was true of the earlier models - an attempt to provide economic framework for analyzing accidents that could be applied generally
* Tort rules function as a mechanism for internalizing externalities
  * Awarding tort damages can be viewed as a Pigouvian tax, applied after the fact, intended to disincentivize certain actions
  * **Fundamental question is when does the law need to intervene in order to internalize externalities, when should intervention occur through liability rules, and what is the optimal structure of liability?**
  * For Calabresi, Posner, and Shavell - tort liability is an effective mechanism for inducing optimal investments in care by both injurers and victims when liability is needed to internalize costs as it is for accidents involving strangers or customers who cannot observe the quality of goods/services prior to purchase
* Goal of Law and Economics approach is to maximize efficiency
  * To achieve efficiency is to  maximize net surplus/welfare. Economists have used several formulations of this term throughout the last century
    * Pareto Efficiency: At least 1 person is better off , nobody is worse off
    * Hicks-Kaldor Efficiency: Gains to winners are large enough to compensate losers
    * Allocative Efficiency: Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost
* Elements of economically efficient approach present pre-20th century
  * O.W. Holmes argued for letting the costs of an accident fall where they may unless there is come clear societal benefit in shifting them
  * However, administrative efficiency is only one aspect of the broader concept of economic efficiency
* Transaction costs are critical to economic analysis
  * Costs involved in establishing and enforcing property rights/contractual arrangements
  * In contract law, courts/lawmakers can reduce transactions cost ex ante through standardized "gap-filling". However, tort rule can only govern liability after the harm has occurred
* Economically efficient framework can be contrasted by one that prioritizes corrective justice
  * Sees tort law as providing rectification or redress for an invasion of a legal right
  * Modern formulations stress view that purpose of law is solely a matter of fairness in resolving disputes between parties and undoing imbalances created by violation of a preexisting right
  * Long term incentives are viewed as extrinsic to the basic purpose of law

## Functional School of Law and Economics (i.e. Klick)

* Developed out of the  Normative approach to L&E, it recognizes the structural and political impediments to developing efficient legal rules and remedying faulty ones
* Because it is difficult to identify all of the ultimate consequences of corrective legal rules, the functional school focuses on using economic theory to design legal meta-rules that lead to efficiency ex ante. This requires design of legal institutions that induce individuals to internalize the effects of their private activities, as well as to reveal their true preferences in situations where collective decisions must be made
  * Functional school’s focus on ex ante welfare. That is, ideally, legal meta-rules should be designed to maximize expected welfare, not realized welfare
* Skeptical of the Positive school's general efficiency hypothesis and even more vocally skeptical of its application to sources of the law other than common law (e.g., legislation or administrative regulations)
* Critical of Normative school and its tendency to overlook the many unintended consequences of legal intervention
* Methodological foundations in Public Choice Theory
  * In spite of the sophisticated mathematical techniques of economic analysis, judges and policymakers in many situations still lack the expertise and methods for evaluating the efficiency of alternative legal rules
  * Functional analysis, on the other hand, requires them to first inquire into the incentives underlying the legal or social structure that generated the legal rule, rather than directly attempting to weigh the costs and benefits of individual rules
  * With this focus on the underlying legal and social structure, there is less impetus to micro-manage individual legal and policy decisions, which are likely to suffer from the rent seeking activities of interested parties
* The need to make comparative evaluations between different rules motivates much of law and economics
* What should be the maximand?
  * Unlike wealth (or quantities of physical resources), utility cannot be objectively measured. Furthermore, interpersonal comparisons of utility are impossible, rendering any balancing across groups or individuals largely arbitrary. These limitations make utility maximization unviable for practical policy purposes
  * As a result, L&E scholars have increasingly used wealth maximization in place of pure utility. Posner is the most notable exponent of the wealth maximization paradigm. Under wealth maximization principles, a transaction is desirable if it increases the sum of wealth for the relevant parties
    * Objection 1: Critics argue that rights have value that must be accounted for outside of how useful they might be to the accumulation of wealth.
    * Objection 2: An increase in wealth cannot constitute social improvement unless it furthers some other social goal, such as utility or equality
  * Defense - Posner explicitly advocates wealth maximization as a criterion that should guide judicial rule making. Because of the market’s ability to capture subjective values and preferences, wealth maximization is a comprehensive measure of social welfare, wealth maximization can be regarded as a superior ethical principle because it is more consistent with ethical intuitions, provides for a more sound theory of justice, and yields more definite results than the alternative economic views on justice
* Functional law and economics bypasses the wealth/utility divide by focusing on choice or revealed preference as the criterion of decision. That is, by designing mechanisms through which parties are induced to reveal their subjective preferences, the functional law and economics approach obviates the need for third parties, such as judges or legislators, to decide between wealth and utility as the appropriate maximand
  * The institutions favored by the functional approach minimize the impediments to the full revelation of the subjective preferences of the parties to a transaction by focusing on incentive compatibility mechanisms. This mechanism design approach tends to align individual and social optimality
  * The mechanism design perspective of economics attempts to channel the intrinsic behavioral tendencies of individuals to reach a desired social outcome. That is, **rather than attempting to alter individual behavior, functional law and economics suggests that institutions should provide incentives, such that individuals will naturally act in a desired way without any external monitoring or coercion**
    * This necessarily requires that individuals have the ability and incentive to reveal their own subjective values and preferences, and that all costs and benefits generated by an individual’s actions accrue to that individual. Implies that individuals will only achieve socially optimal outcomes when they act for their own gain, and incentives are not attenuated by principal agent problems whereby an individual is directed to fulfill some social goal directly

## Coase Theorem

* If there are no transaction costs, the efficient outcome will occur regardless (or in spite) of the legal rule
  * Regardless of whom the law gives the entitlement, the same efficient will result
* If there are positive transaction costs, the efficient outcome may not occur under every legal rule. In these circumstances, the preferred legal rule is the one minimizing the effects of transaction costs
* There are a few foundational ideas/assumptions that must be understood prior to a discussion of Coase's theorem
  * All externalities are, in fact, reciprocal
    * An “opportunity cost” – that is the financial cost of an economic opportunity that an actor declines to take - is incurred when reducing activity level to correct externality
    * Railroad company running fewer trains per day to prevent fires in nearby fields results in unrealized profits
  * The distinction between property rights and liability rules, which often coexist in same resource
    * Property rights are exclusive rights that can't be confiscated involuntarily. Remedies for enforcing protection of these rights are intended to deter/prevent violation (e.g. enjoinders, punitive damages)
    * Liability rules provide right to claim damages for injury to a resource, but no right to exclude (i.e. I can't prevent you from engaging in the risky behavior, but if you harm me, then you are liable). Remedies are compensatory
    * Liability rules allow involuntary transfer of resources through the courts since injurer has right to inflict harm \*if\* willing to pay the cost. Transfer of property rights can only occur through voluntary bargaining at the market level
    * **If voluntary market transaction costs are low, they are economically preferable than the liability/court transaction approach since markets are more reliable registers of value**. If these same costs are high, property approach is inferior because optimal use is prevented (this is when people rely on the courts)
* Railroad-Farmer Example:
  * Railroad keeps starting fires in corn field adjacent to train tracks. The more trains run per day, the more fires that ignite and the more crop damage is done
  * Railroad profits and crop damage where x = # of trains, R(x) is railroad profit as a function of x, and D(x) is crop damage as a function of x

      | x | R(x) | R\`(x) | D(x) | D\`(x) | R-D |
      |---|------|--------|------|--------|-----|
      | 1 | 3.50 |   3    | 0.50 |   1    |  3  |
      | 2 | 6.00 |   2    | 2.00 |   2    |  4  |
      | 3 | 7.50 |   1    | 4.50 |   3    |  3  |
      | 4 | 8.00 |   0    | 8.00 |   4    |  0  |
      | 5 | 7.50 |  -1    |12.50 |   5    | -5  |
      | 6 | 6.00 |  -2    |18.00 |   6    | -12 |
  * Assume we are in a world where transaction costs are high and RR decides to accept liability of crop damage
    * Here Marginal Cost (MC) is defined as the damages RR will have to pay by running 1 additional train per day. Marginal Benefit is defined as the additional profit P will gain by running 1 additional train
    * Profit maximizing output (where MB = MC) would result in RR running 2 trains per day (x = 2).
  * However, even if assume we are in a system where the law does not impose any liability on the RR company and the farmer and the railroad company are free to negotiate a compromise, the **same efficient level of output would result**
    * Assume farmer's gross profits are $10 and RR has right to run trains without liability
    * Profit maximizing level of output for RR is 4 trains per day, resulting in $8 in crop damage costs incurred by F (net profit of $2)
    * F would be willing to offer up to $6 dollars for RR to reduce output to 2 trains and be better off (net profit >=$2)
    * RR would accept bargain since it would be better off as well (net profit >$8)
    * Bargaining skills of parties would determine exact amount paid by F to RR, though profit maximizing price in the aggregate would be $3
  * Even we assume there are alternative ways to mitigate crop damage, such as planting spark resistant crops, a similar transfer would be made. The cheapest method of avoiding the cost will be selected, regardless of who actually incurs it
* Assumption of zero transaction costs is obviously never reflected in the real world
  * Whenever transaction costs are lower than the gains from transacting, there will not result an externality
  * In these cases, voluntary transactions of property rights will lead to efficiency while being cheaper to administer than the legal system
  * Courts/Lawmakers must determine which approach brings closer to the optimal result (i.e. that of a "perfect)
* Other possible weaknesses
  * Coase's theorem has no room for normative judgements, thus it indifferent about which party actually bears the cost. However, giving injurer right to create risk or injured right to be free from risk affects the distribution of wealth

## Strict Liability vs. Negligence

* Problem of Uncertainty
  * How to attach value and hence chose among uncertain prospects
  * Assumption 1: Utility is a function of income (U = U(I))
  * Assumption 2: People have preference for income, hence positive MU (subject to diminishing returns)
  * Uncertainty is brought in by expressing expected utility as:
    ```E(U) = ΣpᵢU(Iᵢ)```
    * where there are n # of mutually exclusive states and sum of all p values is equal to 1
  * A rational individual will choose that prospect with the greatest expected utility
  * However, not all people value uncertain prospects the same, hence there are different utility functions for different risk appetites
    * For the risk averse, U'' < 0
      * Loss in utility from losing $1 is greater than gain in utility from gaining $1
    * For risk preferring, U'' > 0
    * When given option between two different prospects, one in which I is certain and the other where I is uncertain but both yield the same E(I):
      * Risk neutral will be indifferent
      * Risk preferring will favor uncertain
      * Risk averse will favor certain
  * **Assumption of economic approach to tort law is that bother injurers and victims are risk neutral**
    * While unrealistic, it simplifies the analysis and yields more definite predictions
    * This assumption would be inappropriate when examining some mechanism intended to reduce risk (e.g. insurance. However, it is clear that tort law does not serve this function. It cost much more to litigate than it would to just buy insurance.
* Optimal or Due Care
  * Benefit of our assumption of risk neutrality is that the utility function is linear and we can effective use I as a proxy for social welfare
  * Hypo:
    * Car accident between A and B. A is the victim and B is the injurer. A's inputs of care are denoted by x. B's inputs of care denoted by y.
    * Probability of an accident is a function of inputs of care and subject to diminishing returns: `p(x,y)`
    * D is the dollar equivalent of the injury
    * A(x) and B(x) is the cost of care to A and B, respectively
    * Thus, expected utility for A (victim):
      ```math
      E(Uₐ) = p(Iₐ - D - A(x)) + (1 - p) (Iₐ - A(x))
            =  Iₐ - pD - A(x)
      ```
    * Expected utility for B (injurer (using sub-beta instead of sub-b because no unicode char)):
      ```math
      E(Uᵦ) = p(Iᵦ- B(y)) + (1 - p) (Iᵦ - B(y))
            =  Iᵦ - B(y)
      ```
    * Sum of expected utilities:
      ```math
      E(U) = Iₐ + Iᵦ - pD - A(x) - B(y)
      ```
    * Social costs can thus be expressed as a function of each parties level of care:
      ```math
      L(x,y) = p(x,y)D + A(x) + B(y)
      ```
    * Conclusion: **Optimal level of care is that which minimizes social costs (L)**
      * How do we find this? Take partial derivatives of L with respect to each x and y and then set the resulting expressions to 0
        * This yields:
          ```math
          Aₓ = -pₓD
          Bᵧ = -pᵧD
          ```
        * Where `Aₓ` and `By` are marginal costs of care for A and B respectively and `-pₓD` and `-pᵧD` are the reductions in expected damages for an additional unit of x or y.
    * **Thus, A and B should keep adding inputs of care until the reduction in expected damages is equal to the marginal cost of the last unit of care**
  * Inputs of care take two forms:
    1. Perform the activity more carefully
    1. Reduce the overall level of activity
  * In previous hypothetical, Coase Theorem would assert that, if costs of voluntary negotiation are not prohibitive, A and B will agree to use `x*` and `y*` (i.e. optimal levels of care) because they maximize the party's joint incomes
    * If transactions are infeasible (A and B are strangers), however, there arises an externality problem: Why should B expend any resources on care if all benefits inure to A?
    * Raises the important issue which becomes major focus of Law and Econ approach: **How liability rules can serve to internalize the costs of accidents and thereby induce A and B to invest `x*` and `y*` respectively**?
* Liability Rules
  * Problem with this analysis: It assumes individuals fall into pre-determined roles of potential victim and potential injurer
    * In reality, level of care exercised may ultimately determine who is seen as the victim
    * This is simply an assumption though
  * No Liability
    * Victim has incentive to invest to point where `Aₓ=-pₓD`, but injurer has no incentive to alter level of care since they won't accrue the benefits
    * Only efficient if injurers optimal care is 0
  * Strict Liability
    * Symmetrical with zero liability - this time the potential victim has no incentive to take care because he is fully compensated, whereas injurer must invest in care up to point where `Bᵧ=-pᵧD`
    * More expensive, however, than no liability since no liability has no costs to administer
      * Perhaps victim does have small incentive to exercise care: to avoid legal costs
    * Argument that strict liability will induce injurer to greater level of care is nonsense, says Posner. Will never expend more than `y*`, assuming the party is risk neutral
  * Negligence
    * Rule can be reduced to the following (ignoring contributory negligence by assuming x=0): if injurers inputs are less than his optimal amount, he is liable for P's damages
      * This looks like a variant of the Hand formula
      * Since D would only be liable for P's injuries if he failed to exercise this level of due care, he has incentive to exercise optimal level of care (`y*`)
    * Reasons why negligence doesn't always induce proper level of care
      * Depends on both injurer's and court's determination of `y*` and any slight difference may result in D being liable despite significant amount of resources on care but slightly below that required by court's determination. D is then liable for both P's damage and the cost of care it had taken and believed to have been sufficient. This is not allocatively efficient
        * Care has a stochastic element-  a potential injurer may attempt to achieve a level of care `y*`, but his realized care is `y = y* + e`, where e is a random error term with a mean of zero
      * Reasonable person standard used in negligence determination of `y*` where injurer lacks the capabilities of an average person
  * Economic distinction between strict liability and negligence: incentives to avoid accidents by reducing the level of activity vs. incentives to avoid by increasing the care with which the activity is conducted
    * Under strict liability, a potential injurer will interpret `y*` broadly. He is interested in any measure that would reduce his expected liability by more than the cost oft he measure; it is a matter of indifference to him whether the cost results from having to purchase some safety input or from forgoing the profits from a higher level of productive activity
    * Under negligence, all that matters for potential injurer is confined to only the level of care. There is no incentive to reduce overall activity level since all injurer needs to do to avoid liability is to ensure that optimal level of care is taken
      * When a court determines `y*`, as it must when the rule is negligence rather than strict liability, it may take a narrower view of the potential injurer's options
        * Courts consider precautionary measures. It generally won't take into consideration whether a specific transaction or activity that lead to the injury was really necessary (i.e. in excess)
          * Information costs of determining activity level are usually too high for court to attempt determining
          * However, where information costs are low and optimal activity level are easy to obtain (ones that have high p regardless of level of precautions taken such as running into a burning building to get a hat), courts will find such activity negligent
          * Argument that shift to negligence standard has lead to courts "subsidizing" dangerous but productive activities has no merit if this tradeoff is done right
    * However, under strict liability standard, victim has no incentive to adjust activity level since he is fully compensated for any injury not caused by his failure to be careful
    * Conversely, under standard of negligence, victim has incentive to adjust activity level because he won't be compensated if injurer takes proper care. Thus, he must internalize the costs of activity.
    * **Conclusion: Different effects of strict liability and negligence on activity do not provide an economic reason for preferring strict liability to negligence. Neither standard is consistently more efficient than the other**
      * Where P's activity level is an efficient method of accident avoidance, SL is attractive and will be the rule chosen
      * Where greater care is optimal method of accident avoidance by potential injurers, case for negligence is strengthened
* Contributory Negligence
  * Assume that each party minimizes his expected loss (or conversely, maximizes expected income) by taking account of the particular liability rule and the likely behavior of the other party
    * If A expects B to be negligent, he will chose `x*` in order to minimize loss (since any `x` where `x < x*` would preclude recovery under CN)
    * Likewise, if A expects B to exercise `y*`, he will still chose `x*` since B would no longer be held negligent and he now has incentive to take precaution
    * Since A has incentive to exercise `x*`, regardless of B's level of care, B will form his expectations around this
    * Thus, B has incentive to exercise `y*` because it expects A to exercise `x*` and failure to exercise any level of care below `y*` would result in B being liable under negligence standard
  * However, negligence doesn't need CN inorder to induce victims to take due level of care
    * B will still have incentive to chose `y*` when A fails to take due level of care because CN is no longer a defense. Thus, B has incentive to exercise due level of care regardless of its expectations regarding A
    * Since B will always have incentive to exercise `y*`, A will adjust his expectations. Since `y*` would result in no liability for B, A will have incentive to exercise `x*` in order to minimize expected losses
  * Why is there CN defense then?
    1. If parties don't chose level of care simultaneously, but only after observing other party's, and injurer (for whatever reason) defies incentives and exercises level below due care, then victim who observes this will no longer have incentive to mitigate
    1. More importantly, because negligence system will not always succeed in deterring careless behavior, CN will operate to avoid liability where both parties fail to take due care. In these cases, CN serves to reduce costs of administering tort system where no allocative purpose would be served by imposing liability
* Comparative Negligence
  * Yields the same result as contributory negligence (optimal levels of care by both parties)
  * Only applicable where `y < y*` and `x < x*`, then victims damages are apportioned between parties with `s` being the share of their respective damages
    * However, there is no equilibrium where both parties exercise less than due level of care
    * Both of these can't be true: `sₐp(x₀,y₀)D + A(x₀) < A(x*)` and `sᵦp(x₀,y₀)D + B(y₀) < B(y*)`
    * Thus, one party will always exercise optimal level of care and other will alter expectations and adjust its level of care to the optimal point as well
  * No advantages of comparative negligence to contributory negligence or just plain negligence within the economic model
    * Negligence is less costly to administer because it avoids apportionment costs when both parties are negligent
  * **Within this model, movement of courts towards comparative negligence is a contradiction to the positive economic theory of tort law**
    * Only way this might be beneficial is if we assume insurance is unavailable, individuals are strongly risk averse, and the cost of apportionment is small (it's not)
    * While we may perceive this to be unfair, there comparative negligence is more costly from an administrability standpoint without producing more allocatively efficient results

## Accident Law

* Hand Formula
  * Attempt to articulate what has long been underlying negligence determinations
  * Limitations of the hand formula (compared to the model above)
    * Expression of total, instead of marginal, values me lead to liability finding where it would be allocatively inefficient
    * Makes no reference to care on behalf of potential victim (neglects joint care)
