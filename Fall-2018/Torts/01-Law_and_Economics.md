# Introduction to Law and Economics Approach to Torts

## Torts

* Regulatory mechanism/tool that is enforced privately (i.e. private actors initiate tort actions)
* Compensatory system allowing relief/recovery for wronged individuals
* Criticism of tort system in the US
  * Slow, unpredictable, and expensive
    * Part of the unpredictability is due to ambiguity in the conflicts and absence of a clear rule or standard
    * In face of this ambiguity, disputes might best be resolved through deference to a jury, allowing democratic enforcement of norms

## Law and Economics

* Law and Economics approach has been the dominant framework in tort law since the 1970's
* Posner - Hypothesis is that the rules governing tort liability are best explained as efforts to minimize social costs
* Tort rules function as a mechanism for internalizing externalities
  * Awarding tort damages can be viewed as a Pigouvian tax, applied after the fact, intended to disincentivize certain actions
* Goal of Law and Economics approach is to maximize efficiency
  * To achieve efficiency is to  maximize net surplus/welfare. Economists have used several formulations of this term throughout the last century
    * Pareto Efficiency: At least 1 person is better off , nobody is worse off
    * Hicks-Kaldor Efficiency: Gains to winners are large enough to compensate losers
    * Allocative Efficiency: Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost
* Elements of economically efficient approach present pre-20th century
  * O.W. Holmes argued for letting the costs of an accident fall where they may unless there is come clear societal benefit in shifting them
  * However, administrative efficiency is only one aspect of the broader concept of economic efficiency
* Transaction costs are critical to economic analysis
  * Costs involved in establishing and enforcing property rights/contractual arrangements
  * In contract law, courts/lawmakers can reduce transactions cost ex ante through standardized "gap-filling". However, tort rule can only govern liability after the harm has occurred
* Economically efficient framework can be contrasted by one that prioritizes corrective justice
  * Sees tort law as providing rectification or redress for an invasion of a legal right
  * Modern formulations stress view that purpose of law is solely a matter of fairness in resolving disputes between parties and undoing imbalances created by violation of a preexisting right
  * Long term incentives are viewed as extrinsic to the basic purpose of law

## Coase Theorem

* If there are no transaction costs, the efficient outcome will occur regardless (or in spite) of the legal rule
  * Regardless of whom the law gives the entitlement, the same efficient will result
* If there are positive transaction costs, the efficient outcome may not occur under every legal rule. In these circumstances, the preferred legal rule is the one minimizing the effects of transaction costs
* We first need to understand the distinction between property rights and liability rules, which often coexist in same resource
  * Property rights are exclusive rights that can't be confiscated involuntarily. Remedies for enforcing protection of these rights are intended to deter/prevent violation (e.g. enjoinders, punitive damages)
  * Liability rules provide right to claim damages for injury to a resource, but no right to exclude (i.e. I can't prevent you from engaging in the risky behavior, but if you harm me, then you are liable). Remedies are compensatory
  * Liability rules allow involuntary transfer of resources through the courts since injurer has right to inflict harm \*if\* willing to pay the cost. Transfer of property rights can only occur through voluntary bargaining at the market level
  * **If voluntary market transaction costs are low, they are economically preferable than the liability/court transaction approach since markets are more reliable registers of value**. If these same costs are high, property approach is inferior because optimal use is prevented (this is when people rely on the courts)
* Railroad-Farmer Example:
  * Railroad keeps starting fires in corn field adjacent to train tracks. The more trains run per day, the more fires that ignite and the more crop damage is done
  * Railroad profits and crop damage where x = # of trains, R(x) is railroad profit as a function of x, and D(x) is crop damage as a function of x

      | x | R(x) | R\`(x) | D(x) | D\`(x) | R-D |
      |---|------|--------|------|--------|-----|
      | 1 | 3.50 |   3    | 0.50 |   1    |  3  |
      | 2 | 6.00 |   2    | 2.00 |   2    |  4  |
      | 3 | 7.50 |   1    | 4.50 |   3    |  3  |
      | 4 | 8.00 |   0    | 8.00 |   4    |  0  |
      | 5 | 7.50 |  -1    |12.50 |   5    | -5  |
      | 6 | 6.00 |  -2    |18.00 |   6    | -12 |
  * Assume we are in a world where transaction costs are high and RR decides to accept liability of crop damage
    * Here Marginal Cost (MC) is defined as the damages RR will have to pay by running 1 additional train per day. Marginal Benefit is defined as the additional profit P will gain by running 1 additional train
    * Profit maximizing output (where MB = MC) would result in RR running 2 trains per day (x = 2).
  * However, even if assume we are in a system where the law does not impose any liability on the RR company and the farmer and the railroad company are free to negotiate a compromise, the **same efficient level of output would result**
    * Assume farmer's gross profits are $10 and RR has right to run trains without liability
    * Profit maximizing level of output for RR is 4 trains per day, resulting in $8 in crop damage costs incurred by F (net profit of $2)
    * F would be willing to offer up to $6 dollars for RR to reduce output to 2 trains and be better off (net profit >=$2)
    * RR would accept bargain since it would be better off as well (net profit >$8)
    * Bargaining skills of parties would determine exact amount paid by F to RR, though profit maximizing price in the aggregate would be $3
  * Even we assume there are alternative ways to mitigate crop damage, such as planting spark resistant crops, a similar transfer would be made. The cheapest method of avoiding the cost will be selected, regardless of who actually incurs it
* Assumption of zero transaction costs is obviously never reflected in the real world
  * Whenever transaction costs are lower than the gains from transacting, there will not result an externality
  * In these cases, voluntary transactions of property rights will lead to efficiency while being cheaper to administer than the legal system
  * Courts/Lawmakers must determine which approach brings closer to the optimal result (i.e. that of a "perfect)
* Other possible weaknesses
  * Coase's theorem has no room for normative judgements, thus it indifferent about which party actually bears the cost. However, giving injurer right to create risk or injured right to be free from risk affects the distribution of wealth

## Strict Liability vs. Negligence

* Problem of Uncertainty
  * How to attach value and hence chose among uncertain prospects
  * Assumption 1: Utility is a function of income (U = U(I))
  * Assumption 2: People have preference for income, hence positive MU (subject to diminishing returns)
  * Uncertainty is brought in by expressing expected utility as:
    ```E(U) = ΣpᵢU(Iᵢ)```
    * where there are n # of mutually exclusive states and sum of all p values is equal to 1
  * A rational individual will choose that prospect with the greatest expected utility
  * However, not all people value uncertain prospects the same, hence there are different utility functions for different risk appetites
    * For the risk averse, U'' < 0
      * Loss in utility from losing $1 is greater than gain in utility from gaining $1
    * For risk preferring, U'' > 0
    * When given option between two different prospects, one in which I is certain and the other where I is uncertain but both yield the same E(I):
      * Risk neutral will be indifferent
      * Risk preferring will favor uncertain
      * Risk averse will favor certain
  * **Assumption of economic approach to tort law is that bother injurers and victims are risk neutral**
    * While unrealistic, it simplifies the analysis and yields more definite predictions
    * This assumption would be inappropriate when examining some mechanism intended to reduce risk (e.g. insurance. However, it is clear that tort law does not serve this function. It cost much more to litigate than it would to just buy insurance.
* Optimal or Due Care
  * Benefit of our assumption of risk neutrality is that the utility function is linear and we can effective use I as a proxy for social welfare
  * Hypo:
    * Car accident between A and B. A is the victim and B is the injurer. A's inputs of care are denoted by x. B's inputs of care denoted by y.
    * Probability of an accident is a function of inputs of care and subject to diminishing returns: p(x,y)
    * D is the dollar equivalent of the injury
    * A(x) and B(x) is the cost of care to A and B, respectively
    * Thus, expected utility for A (victim):
      ```math
      E(Ua) = p(Iₐ - D - A(x)) + (1 - p) (Iₐ - A(x))
            =  Iₐ - pD - A(x)
      ```
    * Expected utility for B (injurer (using sub-beta instead of P b/c there is no unicode subscript B in unicode)):
      ```math
      E(Ub) = p(Iᵦ- B(y)) + (1 - p) (Iᵦ - B(y))
            =  Iᵦ - B(y)
      ```
    * Sum of expected utilities:
      ```math
      E(U) = Iₐ + Iᵦ - pD - A(x) - B(y)
      ```
    * Social costs can thus be expressed as a function of each parties level of care:
      ```math
      L(x,y) = p(x,y)D + A(x) + B(y)
      ```
    * Conclusion: **Optimal level of care is that which minimizes social costs (L)**
      * How do we find this? Take partial derivatives of L with respect to each x and y and then set the resulting expressions to 0
        * This yields:
          ```math
          Aₓ = -pₓD
          Bᵧ = -pᵧD
          ```
        * Where Aₓ and By are marginal costs of care for A and B respectively and -pₓD and -pᵧD are the reductions in expected damages for an additional unit of x or y.
    * **Thus, A and B should keep adding inputs of care until the reduction in expected damages is equal to the marginal cost of the last unit of care**
  * Inputs of care take two forms:
    1. Perform the activity more carefully
    1. Reduce the overall level of activity
  * In previous hypothetical, Coase Theorem would assert that, if costs of voluntary negotiation are not prohibitive, A and B will agree to use x\* and y\* (i.e. optimal levels of care) because they maximize the party's joint incomes
    * If transactions are infeasible (A and B are strangers), however, there arises an externality problem: Why should B expend any resources on care if all benefits inure to A?
    * Raises the important issue which becomes major focus of Law and Econ approach: **How liability rules can serve to internalize the costs of accidents and thereby induce A and B to invest x\* and y\* respectively**?
* Liability Rules
  * Problem with this analysis: It assumes individuals fall into pre-determined roles of potential victim and potential injurer
    * In reality, level of care exercised may ultimately determine who is seen as the victim
    * This is simply an assumption though
  * No Liability
    * Victim has incentive to invest to point where Aₓ=-pₓD, but injurer has no incentive to alter level of care since they won't accrue the benefits
    * Only efficient if injurers optimal care = 0
  * Strict Liability
    * Symmetrical with zero liability - this time the potential victim has no incentive to take care because he is fully compensated, whereas injurer must invest in care up to point where Bᵧ=-pᵧD
    * More expensive, however, than no liability since no liability has no costs to administer
      * Perhaps victim does have small incentive to exercise care: to avoid legal costs
    * Argument that strict liability will induce injurer to greater level of care is nonsense, says Posner. Will never expend more than y\*, assuming the party is risk neutral
  * Negligence
    * Rule can be reduced to the following (ignoring contributory negligence by assuming x=0): if injurers inputs are less than his optimal amount, he is liable for P's damages
      * This looks like a variant of the Hand formula
