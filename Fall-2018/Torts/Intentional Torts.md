# Intentional Torts

## Physical Harms

### Battery

* **Intent** to cause contact and substantial certainty that act will cause contact
  * Single intent approach:
    * Single intent is simply the intent to make contact
    * Section 102 of the *Third Restatement*: Intent required for battery is intent to cause contact, whether or not harm or offense was intended.
    * Offers more protection to plaintiffs bodily interest, as one can still be liable even if they reasonably believe the contact would not cause harm.
  * Dual intent approach
    * Dual intent is the intent to make contact that is harmful or offensive.
    * Section 14 of the *Second Restatement*: an individual is liable for battery if he is intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with a person and the harmful contact results
    * Consistent with view that liability for battery should only exist when actor meets certain threshold of culpability that is greater than strict liability.
  * Transferred Intent Principle
    * If A intends to hit B and hits C by mistake,the intent meant for B is transferred to C—since we now have intent and hit, A is liable for battery caused to C

#### [*Vosberg v. Putney*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibc1af9ec002711dabf60c1d57ebc853e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

Once defendant has committed a wrongful, he is liable for all harms resulting regardless of whether they were foreseeable or intended. Intent to kick is enough for liability, no need for intent to hurt to the extent that resulted. The theory that damages recoverable should be commensurate to the level of forseeable harm was rejected by the court

### Trespass to Land

* Violation of an individuals exclusive possession of property
* The controlling intent in trespass cases is the intent to complete the physical act, not the intent to harm. The act is wrongful/unlawful in itself
* Damages are not required in trespass. Every unauthorized entry onto the land of another is a trespass regardless of the amount of damages
* Intangible trespasses
  * Things like external noises and scents that approach an individual's property
  * Non-physical intrusions may gave rise to trespass claims but only if one can prove both intent and physical damage

#### [*Dougherty v. Stepp*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ie747226404c811da9439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

D entered P’s land to survey part of it but did not cause damages. Judgment for P because tort is a volitional act regard of harm caused. Every unauthorized entry onto an other's property is a trespass and for every such entry the law infers some damages, even if the harm was negligible

### Consensual Defense to Intentional Torts

* Defense to liability on grounds that tortfeasor was given consent, implicit or explicit, to perform an act from which the alleged damage resulted
  * A strong defense because it is grounded in the principle of autonomy
* Implied consent
  * Individual is aware of the harms that are likely or regularly occur in the course of an action, yet choses to proceed with it can be viewed as a consent
  * In some medical cases, court has acknowledged that conditions discovered during internal operations cannot be consented to due to patient's incapacitation. Thus, the court, under the assumption that a rational agent would consent, will permit extension of an operation as dictated by the doctor's professional expertise.
* Majority view asserts that one cannot consent to an unlawful act out of principle..
  * Raises questions about private actions for damages arising out of criminal activity and whether it incentivizes or deters this activity.
* **Exceptions**: Cases where consent was the result of fraud, misrepresentation, or undue duress.

#### [*Mohr v. Williams*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I3e932dfa01f111da8ac8f235252e36df/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P sustains injury to left ear during operation of on right ear despite not consenting to any additional procedures. Court ruled that the operation was performed without consent or circumstances that would override the need for consent, hence it was unlawful. Since unlawful contact with person constitutes battery, D is liable for technical battery. However, the court states that the amount to recovery P is entitled to is not clear and instructed that the circumstances must be taken into account by trial court. *(Note: D's liability for the harm depend on the theory of intent applied by the court. D might not be liable under dual-intent approach because contact was not intended to be harmful)*

#### [*Hudson v. Craft*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I01afc44bfad311d9bf60c1d57ebc853e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P, a minor, is injured in an unlicensed (illegal) boxing match. Despite the fact that P consented, a statue intended a class of people by deeming an act illegal, cannot be consented to. Thus, the court finds that D, the fight promoter, was liable.

### Mental Disability as a Defense to Intentional Torts

* An insane person is liable in tort for damages caused when he or she:
  1. Was capable of entertaining intent to commit harmful/unlawful act
  2. Did in fact entertain that intent
  3. Acted upon that intent
* Justification for liability
  * Economic Incentives - Incentivize guardians of disabled person to exercise better care so as to minimize the harm done. Also deters usage of insanity as a pretense.

#### [*McGuire v. Almy*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia6e361e0ce5211d983e7e9deff98dc6f/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

In the midst of a tantrum, with threats to do harm and actual violence, P goes into room to take a stick away from D. P fails and gets hurt. Applying the general rule, D was held liable, as she was capable of entertaining and acting on intent to harm. P's intervention cannot be viewed as implied consent, as she was responding to an emergency situation and not acting voluntarily.

### Defense of Property and Self

* Self-Defense
  * In most cases of intentional harms (i.e. trespass, conversion), risk of an innocent mistake falls on individual making it.
    * Assault/battery seems to be the exception
    * Restatement (Second) states accidental harm of an innocent third party is only actionable if the actor realizes or should realize risk of causing such harm is unreasonable.
  * This defense is much stronger when the plaintiff has already assaulted the defendant
    * Stand your ground laws have been adopted in several states
  * The self-defense privilege extends to intervening third-parties to the same extent that they are privileged to defend themselves if they reasonably believe that they are entitled to force and that it is necessary to protect the party (RST Sec. 76)
* Defense of property
  * Generally require some notice to be provided to potential trespassers, which serves as the functional equivalent of self-defense requirements.
  * Restatement (Second) - An actor is privileged to use a device likely to cause serious body harm for the purpose of protecting his land from intrusion to the extent that he would privileged to prevent/terminate harm were he present.
  * Posner - Requirement to provide notice established in Holbrook is "ingenious" because it balances protection of property and cost of maintaining domestic animals, as uncertainty surrounding presence of defense mechanisms would deter individuals pursuing animals anytime they strayed onto someone elses land.

#### [*Courvoisier v. Raymond*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia68182a3f85e11d99439b076ef9ec4de/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

D fires weapon to scare off group of individuals attempting to break into jewelry store that occupies space below his apartment. Gunshots attracts P, who identifies himself as an officer and commands him to to stop shooting. P is mistakenly shot while rushing towards D. Court asserts that in order to determine of self-defense was justified, it must consider whether circumstances would lead reasonable person to believe their life was in danger or there was a threat of great physical harm posed by P. The court found that behavior of the burglars, along with the darkness preventing D from being able to distinguish D, is sufficient justification and hence the mistake is excusable.

#### [Bird v. Holbrook]

Case from England where D set up spring gun in walled garden to catch thieves from removing valuable tulips. P enters garden chasing after peacock and triggers the spring gun, sustaining serious injuries. Court recognized legitimate social value of allowing D to protect property, though P's action in attempt to recover his property also had value. Further, intent of spring gun seemed to exceed deterrence, as D was trying to lure and injure a potential thief. Hence, D's action was not proportional threat posed by property. Court ruled that notice to property dwellers must be provided if these countermeasures are resorted to.

### Necessity

* Entry upon land is justified out of necessity
  * Goods in danger of destruction
  * Lives at risk
  * Forces outside of individual's control
* General common law rule of necessity is that owner of property may not resist entry out of conditions of necessity, but have no legal obligation to facilitate such entry or provide assistance
* Incomplete Necessity
  * In taking private property for the purpose of preservation out of necessity, any damage that results to that property is still compensable
  * This may incentivize individuals to take extra precautions to completely avoid these circumstances without completely barring them from avoiding significant damages when they do arise.
  * This contrasts with self-dense and public necessity (property is damage out of necessity to prevent harm to public), which don't entail just compensation.
* Economic justification for doctrine of necessity - Aside from the preservation of valuable goods and human lives that may come at a small price, it prevents extortion by property owners who deny entry onto land out of necessity unless individual pays some exorbitantly large sum

#### [*Ploof v. Putnam*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I9668b0f9331a11d98b61a35269fc5f88/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

P sues for damages caused when D denied him use of his dock for safety during a storm. This lead to damage of P's boat and injury to members of P's family were on board. D held responsible because D would not allow plaintiff to use D’s property to avoid injury out of necessity.

#### [*Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ifa238d7a001811dab386b232635db992/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")

 D’s ship was unloading at P’s dock. Storm hit preventing D from exiting harbor. D called for tugs, but there were none so they secured the ship to P’s dock, replacing lines as they snapped during the storm. Meanwhile, ship was bumping up against dock, doing $500 damage. The court found the damage didn't arise out of any negligence, as an ordinary level of care was exercised out of necessity. However, it cannot be said that the damage was completely out of D's control and was simply the result of an act of God. Securing the boat to the dock, though done out of necessity to prevent damage to the more valuable ship, was intentional. Hence, P is entitled to compensation. Dissent contends that if P exercised requisite level of care, then he can't be faulted and the risk of such an occurrence is an inherent to owning the dock.

## Emotional and Dignitary Harms

* **Challenges with Torts for Emotional and Dignitary Harm**:
  * How can we quantify the damages and measure and appropriate policy response?
    * Courts are uncomfortable with the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, not because they fail to recognize the harm,but because of the consequences in setting precedent
    * Expectations in response to a rule, which will affect people's behavior and hence welfare, is the focus of the Law/Economics approach, not remedying at an individual case level.

### Assault

* Restatements
  * 1st Restatement: An actor is subject to liability to another for assault if he acts intending to cause a harmful contact with that person…or an imminent apprehension of such contact
  * 2nd Restatement: The law does not require real fear (not necessary that the victim believe that the act will be effective in inflicting the intended injury).  Therefore, a victim may have apprehension—feel threatened but know he can easily prevent the threatened harm by self-defense—and still recover for an actionable assault
