# Intentional Torts

## Physical Harms

1. ### Elements of Battery

   * Intent to cause contact and substantial certainty that act will cause contact
     1. Intent to contact is necessary, no need to intend to cause pain
     2. If the contact causes harm, whether you meant it to or not, you have committed a battery
   * Voluntary act
   * Harmful or offensive contact
      * 2nd Restatement:
      >Sec. 13 BATTERY: HARMFUL CONTACT
      >An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if: he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person or am imminent apprehension of such a contact and harmful contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.
   * [*Vosberg v. Putney*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibc1af9ec002711dabf60c1d57ebc853e/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0 "Westlaw")
      * Once defendant has committed a battery, he is liable for all harms resulting regardless of whether they were foreseeable or intended. Intent to kick is enough for liability, no need for intent to hurt to the extent that resulted. The theory that damages recoverable should be commensurate to the level of forseeable harm was rejected by the court
   * **Transferred Intent**:
     * If A intends to hit B and hits C by mistake,the intent meant for B is transferred to Câ€”since we now have intent and hit, A is liable for battery caused to C

## Emotional and Dignitary Harms

* **Challenges with Torts for Emotional and Dignitary Harm**:
  * How can we quantify the damages and measure and appropriate policy response?

  Courts are uncomfortable with the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, not because they fail to recognize the harm,but because of the consequences in setting precedent.
