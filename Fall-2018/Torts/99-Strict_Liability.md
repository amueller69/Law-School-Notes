# Strict Liability

## Class Notes from Introduction

* Certain damages are designated to have categorical liability
  * Irrespective of the circumstances or intent
* Provides cost effectiveness and administrative expedience
  * If 99 times out of 100, a breach of duty will fail cost/benefit analysis, designating it as strictly liable saves time and resources that would be used to make that determination.
