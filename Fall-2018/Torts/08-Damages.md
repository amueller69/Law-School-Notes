# Damages

## Vicarious Liability

* Two Ways to Hold Employer Liable for Acts of Employees
  * Direct liability – Employer acted wrongfully by failing to screen or supervise employees, and this led to injuries
    * E.g Hiring guy w/drunk driving record, who later gets in accident while drunk
* Respondeat Superior – Management hasn’t done anything wrong, but is on the hook for wrongs of employee, when acts take place in “scope of employment.”
  * Vicarious liability for employers over employees
* In the context of independent contractors?

* Three Tests for establishing “arising out of scope of employment
  1. Motive Test—Employee’s actions are “actuated at least in party by a purpose to serve the master.”
  1. Foresight Test—Actions of the employee are foreseeable (excludes personal life).
  1. Location of the Wrong Test—Employee is in the proximate area of the wrong.

### *Osborne v. McMasters*

Clerk in a drug store gives unlabelled poison to a woman and she dies. Statute declaring that all poison must be labeled was violated. Plaintiff must show that defendant drug store owner violated the statute and that the violation is the proximate cause of death. Statute created a duty for D to use reasonable care to protect customers from taking wrong drug. **If breach a statutory duty and the breach proximately causes injury to a person the statute meant to protect, negligence exists.** He failed. Breach of statutory duty meant to protect customers, P was a customer, breach caused death. Negligent.

### *Ira S. Bushley & Sons*

An employer is vicariously liable for the reasonably foreseeable conduct of its employees performed within the scope of employment, even when such conduct was not motivated by a purpose of serving the employee. Drunken sailor returned to coast guard vessel and began opening valves on the dry dock walls causing the ship to list and slide off the wall. The court uses various tests in concluding that it was reasonably foreseeable for the employer to perceive the risk—not necessarily the exact risk. Plaintiff could have sued employer for negligently hiring employee.

## Compensatory Damages

### Nonpecuniary Damages (Non-Economic)

* Theories
  * **Insurance Theory** - If individuals wouldn’t choose to buy insurance for pain and suffering, then the system shouldn’t include such nonpecuniary damages as part of their recovery ex post.
  * **Diminished Marginal Value** - Inefficient since injured party would rather have money prior to accident for consumption on expenditures in uninjured state so they could fully enjoy it, rather than while injured.
  * **Per-Diem Rule** - Calculate nonpecuniary damages by dividing pain and suffering into days, hours, and minutes, rather than 30 year remaining life expectancy.
  * **Capping Damages** - Some state statutes limit pain and suffering recovery.  Such caps primarily damage seriously injured plaintiffs with legitimate concerns and affect attorney contingency fees for poor plaintiffs who cannot afford a to bring a lawsuit on their own. 
* Loss of Enjoyment of Life (As a distinct concept from pain & suffering)
  * Some degree of cognitive awareness is a prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life
    * If Tort Law is really about compensation (as suggested by theories of corrective justice), then is there any value to compensating an incapacitated/non-cognizant individual. Requirement that P be cognizant corroborates view that torts is indeed about compensation
    * Loss in aggregate social utility is something to be deterred, regardless if harmed individual can be compensated
* Overcompensation
  * How to avoid windfalls when awarding tort damages for lost-income (i.e. income that would have been taxed in the counterfactual)?
    * Currently not taxed

#### *O'Shea v. Riverway Towing Co.*

P injured on harbor boat and brought suit against operator (D) for damages. Jury finds P was free from contributory negligence.

#### *Duncan v. Kansas City Southern RR*

In reviewing the award of damages for abuse of discretion, court will examine the damages awarded in factually similar cases. Ds argue that unconscious biases influencing excessive damages or awarding when not warranted.

* Collateral Source Rule
  * Jury should not be informed of D's insurance status when calculating damages
