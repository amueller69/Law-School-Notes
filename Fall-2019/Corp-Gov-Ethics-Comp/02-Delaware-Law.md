# Corporate Governance and Delaware Law

## Going-Private Mergers Under Delaware Law

* Going-private merger, a corporation’s controlling shareholder attempts to buy the remainder of the corporation’s widely held shares from minority shareholders using the mechanism of a “statutory merger.”
* Delaware courts have traditionally subjected going-private mergers with the burden on controlling-shareholder defendants to demonstrate that such “freezeout” transactions are entirely fair to minority shareholders to entire fairness review
  * Exception to this rule - DE supreme court held that defendants can shift the burden of persuasion under entire fairness review to plaintiffs if the defendants show that the transaction was either (i) negotiated by a well-functioning special committee of independent directors or (ii) conditioned on the approval of a majority of the minority shareholders
  * Entire fairness — fair dealing and fair price — is the highest level of scrutiny used in takeover challenges; it requires courts to evaluate the fairness of both the process of a transaction (its timing, structure, negotiation, disclosure, and approval) and its substance (via the court’s own valuation assessment)
  * Entire fairness can be contrasted with the more deferential business judgment standard in 3rd party mergers, which the court has also held to control when the transaction is conditioned upon **both** approval by an independent and empowered special committee acting with care **and** approval by an majority of minority holders in an informed and non-coerced vote
  * This standard only evaluates whether the directors act in good faith and in an informed manner
  * Justification here is that having two procedural protections baked into the transaction is much different than just one, as the controller "irrevocably and publicly disables itself" much like the type of 3rd party transactions to which the standard has traditionally applied

## Responsibility of Board for Criminal/Civil Liability Imposed on Corporation

* Generally difficult to hold board accountable for corporations wrongdoing (and in turn, losses and penalties that arise out of misconduct) where there are no conflicts of interests or improper motives. Thus, in many cases, ignorance of the wrongdoing can be a valid defense despite the duty of the board to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting mechanisms
  * In a major case, Delaware supreme court rejected that the directors ought to have known about misconduct, because 'absent cause for suspicion there is no duty upon the directors to install and operate a corporate system of espionage to ferret out wrongdoing which they have no reason to suspect exists.'
* *Caremark* was significant because of its expanded interpretation of the duty of oversight, meaning that there is a greater expectation of boards to ensure the implementations **reasonable systems** that sniff out misconduct
  * A systemic failure to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists establishes the lack of good faith necessary to impose liability on the board for breaching their obligations to shareholders
  * Because of this holding, corporations strengthened their compliance programs and many have observed increased attention by directors to the operations of a company
* Thus, to show that directors breached their oversight duty (duty of attention held to fall under the broader category of the duty of loyalty), plaintiffs must show that:
  * The directors knew OR should have known that violations of the law were occurring, and in either event
  * The directors took no steps in a good faith effort to prevent or remedy the situation, and
  * Such failure proximately resulted in the losses complained of (though this last element may be thought to constitute an affirmative defense)

## Cases

### *Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp.* (DE 2014)

* Background: Controlling stockholder wanted to acquire its subsidiary, a transaction that required approval from special committee of directors **and** independent majority of minority stockholders. Merger closed after both approved. Group of minority stockholders bring suit for breach of fiduciary duty, arguing the lower court applied more liberal standard inappropriately and that it failed to satisfy the conditions laid out in the proposal b/c the committee was not independent and impartial.
* Issue: What should be the standard of review for evaluating this type of transaction: the stricter "entire fairness" standard (dual procedural protections) or the more liberal "business judgement"?
* Issue: Did the transaction satisfy the requirements of the applicable standard (i.e. was the committee actually impartial)?
* Holding: Lower court did not err in applying th business judgement standard of review and the special committee was both independent and exercised due care
* Reasoning: The court reasoned that the existing case law did not supply a standard of review for this case, as the present transaction was different from those in prior decisions. As a novel question of law, court justified the business judgement standard because the dual procedural protections were similar to that of arms-length 3rd party mergers and it incentivizes controllers to structure transactions in a way that benefits minority shareholders. Additionally, it ruled that the special committee consisted entirely of independent directors, hired its own advisors, had “clear authority” to reject M&F’s offer “definitively,” considered other strategic options, and negotiated in good faith (fulfilling duty of care), while the “majority-of-the-minority vote was fully informed and non-coerced.

### *Corwin v. KKR Financial Holdings LLC* (DE 2014)

* Background: Merger between KKR and KKR financial holdings , where KKR would acquire holdings . The stockholder plaintiffs sued for breach of fiduciary duty, arguing that KRR was a controlling stockholder of financial holdings because financial holdings' primary business was financing KKR's leveraged buyout activities and was managed by an affiliate of KKR under a management agreement. The plaintiffs asserted that the entire fairness standard of review applied to the transaction and appealed when the lower court dismissed the case for failure to plead facts sufficient to support an inference that KKR was a controlling stockholder, and thus it didn't matter if directors were not disintrested/independent (i.e. did not apply enhanced scrutiny)
* Rule: An uncoerced and fully informed disinterested stockholder vote reduces the standard of review in a merger **without a controlling stockholder** to business judgment
* Holding - Court holds that even if the lower court erred in not applying enhanced scrutiny to directors actions, the uncoerced informed stockholder vote had the effect of restoring business judgment as the standard of judicial review. Here, stockholders approved via vote and it would be bad policy to judicially second-guess the decisions of unimpaired decisions of owners

### *In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation* (Del. Ch. 1996)

* Background: The shareholders of Caremark International, Inc., a company providing managed care and patient care services, brought a derivative action, alleging the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care to Caremark and its shareholders by failing to put in place adequate internal control systems. This in turn was alleged to have enabled the company's employees to commit criminal offences, resulting in substantial fines and civil penalties amounting to over $250 million. The board's failure to fulfil its duty of attention to ongoing operations (which would have presumably revealed illegal conduct) allowed the situation to develop and grow the company's exposure to liability. Court is tasked with reviewing proposed settlement to evaluate its fairness in light of the allegations and evidentiary record
* Rule: A director's obligation includes a duty to attempt in good faith to assure that a corporate information and reporting system exists, and that failure to do so under some circumstances may render boards liable for losses
* Holding: The settlement contract requiring stricter oversight of corporate employees was approved
* Reasoning: Court notes that complaint does not allege anything related to director's having improper motives or conflicts of interest, which makes it difficult to impose liability for breach of care. There were no grounds for suspicion here, and the boards is not wrong for "simply for assuming the integrity of employees and the honesty of their dealings". However, case law makes it clear that "relevant and timely information is an essential predicate for satisfaction of the board's supervisory and monitoring role" and that directors are responsible for ensuring that information and reporting systems exist to satisfy this condition. Failure to have some reasonable monitoring/reporting system may render the board liable for losses caused by non-compliance with applicable legal standards

### *Schnell v. Chris-Craft Industries* (Del. Ch. 1971)

* Background: P, a shareholder of the company (D), demands that D provide him with a stock ledger or list of stockholders as well as daily stock transaction records. The demand letter explained P was on an independent shareholder committee alongside a prominent lawyer, C, and assured that the purpose of the request was not improper or to further any interest apart from the business of D. In joining such committee, C was suspected of violating professional ethics code in because he had previously provided counsel for D but was now aligning himself against D's management. D responded to the letter by declining the requested, stating that so long as C was part of this committee it would not produce the items because its purpose was improper
* Issue: Is former legal counsel's presence on independent shareholder's committee grounds for withholding requested transaction and ownership documents?
* Holding: Court asserts that no ethics violations or compromise of attorney-client relationship as at issue here, and thus D was not justified in declining the request. C had made no appearances in court against D and the document requests could hardly be said to be related to any of the matters for which C provided counsel on
