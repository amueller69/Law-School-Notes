# Going-Private Mergers Under Delaware Law

* Going-private merger, a corporation’s controlling shareholder attempts to buy the remainder of the corporation’s widely held shares from minority shareholders using the mechanism of a “statutory merger.”
* Delaware courts have traditionally subjected going-private mergers with the burden on controlling-shareholder defendants to demonstrate that such “freezeout” transactions are entirely fair to minority shareholders to entire fairness review
 * Exception to this rule - DE supreme court held that defendants can shift the burden of persuasion under entire fairness review to plaintiffs if the defendants show that the transaction was either (i) negotiated by a well-functioning special committee of independent directors or (ii) conditioned on the approval of a majority of the minority shareholders
 * Entire fairness — fair dealing and fair price — is the highest level of scrutiny used in takeover challenges; it requires courts to evaluate the fairness of both the process of a transaction (its timing, structure, negotiation, disclosure, and approval) and its substance (via the court’s own valuation assessment)
 * Entire fairness can be contrasted with the more deferential business judgment standard in 3rd party mergers, which the court has also held to control when the transaction is conditioned upon **both** approval by an independent and empowered special committee acting with care **and** approval by an majority of minority holders in an informed and non-coerced vote
 * Justification here is that having two procedural protections baked into the transaction is much different than just one, as the controller "irrevocably and publicly disables itself" much like the type of 3rd party transactions to which the standard has traditionally applied

## Cases

### Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp. (DE 2014)

* Background: Controlling stockholder wanted to acquire its subsidiary, a transaction that required approval from special committee of directors **and** independent majority of minority stockholders. Merger closed after both approved. Group of minority stockholders bring suit for breach of fiduciary duty, arguing the lower court applied more liberal standard inappropriately and that it failed to satisfy the conditions laid out in the proposal b/c the committee was not independent and impartial.
* Issue: What should be the standard of review for evaluating this type of transaction: the stricter "entire fairness" standard (dual procedural protections) or the more liberal "business judgement"?
* Issue: Did the transaction satisfy the requirements of the applicable standard (i.e. was the committee actually impartial)?
* Holding: Lower court did not err in applying th business judgement standard of review and the special committee was both independent and exercised due care
* Reasoning: The court reasoned that the existing case law did not supply a standard of review for this case, as the present transaction was different from those in prior decisions. As a novel question of law, court justified the business judgement standard because the dual procedural protections were similar to that of arms-length 3rd party mergers and it incentivizes controllers to structure transactions in a way that benefits minority shareholders. Additionally, it ruled that the special committee consisted entirely of independent directors, hired its own advisors, had “clear authority” to reject M&F’s offer “definitively,” considered other strategic options, and negotiated in good faith (fulfilling duty of care), while the “majority-of-the-minority vote was fully informed and non-coerced.

### Corwin v. KKR Financial Holdings LLC (DE 2014)

* Background: Merger between KKR and KKR financial holdings , where KKR would acquire holdings . The stockholder plaintiffs sued for breach of fiduciary duty, arguing that KRR was a controlling stockholder of financial holdings because financial holdings' primary business was financing KKR's leveraged buyout activities and was managed by an affiliate of KKR under a management agreement. The plaintiffs asserted that the entire fairness standard of review applied to the transaction and appealed when the lower court dismissed the case for failure to plead facts sufficient to support an inference that KKR was a controlling stockholder, and thus it didn't matter if directors were not disintrested/independent (i.e. did not apply enhanced scrutiny)
* Rule: An uncoerced and fully informed disinterested stockholder vote reduces the standard of review in a merger **without a controlling stockholder** to business judgment
* Holding - Court holds that even if the lower court erred in not applying enhanced scrutiny to directors actions, the uncoerced informed stockholder vote had the effect of restoring business judgment as the standard of judicial review. Here, stockholders approved via vote and it would be bad policy to judicially second-guess the decisions of unimpaired decisions of owners

### In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation

* Background: The shareholders of Caremark International, Inc. brought a derivative action, alleging the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care by failing to put in place adequate internal control systems. This in turn was said to enable the company's employees to commit criminal offences, resulting in substantial fines and civil penalties amounting to over $250 million.
