# Corporate Crimes (i.e., FCPA, AML, Sanctions, Bank Secrecy Act)

* In the US, the principle underlying corporate criminal liability is **respondeat superior**, meaning an **organisation is responsible for all its employees’ actions done in the course and scope of their employment and, at least in part, for the benefit of the corporate**
  * It is not necessary that the employee have a certain level of corporate responsibility, such as being able to speak for the corporate, being part of a control group or being a directing mind
  * This liability is broad enough that the corporation may be criminally responsible even where the employee acts contrary to corporate policy - as long as the employee criminally acts within the course and scope of employment, even specific counter instructions will not necessarily insulate the corporate
* US law also makes it easier to prosecute corporate entities due to the **“collective knowledge” doctrine**
  * Under this doctrine, the government does not have to demonstrate that a single individual had the knowledge to satisfy the intent element of a crime.  Instead, the government may aggregate the knowledge of many different employees of the corporate to form the corporate’s knowledge of the violation

## Sentencing of Organizations (US Federal Sentencing Guidelines Ch. 8)

* Chapter of the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines designed so that sanctions imposed upon organizations will provide just punishment and adequate deterrence
  * Federal prosecution of corporations frequently involve individuals (responsible for their own conduct) and organizations ("organizational co-defendants" vicariously liable for offenses committed by agents)
  * These guidelines apply only to the latter group
* Guidelines also offer incentives for organizations to reduce and ultimately eliminate criminal conduct by providing a structural foundation from which it can self-police
  * Example: existence of an ethics/compliance program is viewed as a mitigating factor in the courts sentencing decisions, an incentive for firms to implement an effective one
* General principles of the Guidelines
  1. Whenever practicable, court should order organization to remedy any harms cause by the offense. The resources in doing so should be viewed as a compensatory, not punitive, measure
     * Where victim is identifiable, court should enter restitution order to the full amount of the loss
     * Remedial order can also be imposed, which may require the elimination of the risk of future harm
  1. If the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily by criminal means, fine should be high enough to divest organization of all its assets
  1. Six factors should be considered in sentencing/fine determination: level of involvement/tolerance of criminal activity, prior history, violation of an order, obstruction of justice, existence of an effective compliance/ethics program, and self-reporting/cooperation/acceptance of responsibility
  1. Probation is appropriate where needed to ensure another sanction will be fully implemented or to ensure corrective steps will be taken
     * Conditions of probation may include requiring organization to exercise due diligence to prevent/detect criminal conduct and/or to implement a reasonably designed compliance & ethics program that is generally effective in detecting and preventing criminal conduct

## Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

* FCPA was passed in 1977 in response to concerns over the integrity of U.S. markets after hundreds of U.S. companies admitted to paying over $400 million to foreign government officials

### Main Provisions of the FCPA

1. **Anti-bribery provision** - Makes it unlawful for a U.S. company or citizen, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business
   * Makes it unlawful to offer, promise, authorize, or make any payment/gift to a foreign official for the purpose of influencing any act/decision in their official capacity or to use their influence in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business
     * This includes political parties, candidates, or any other person through which the thing of value may knowingly reach an official/candidate
   * There is an exception for facilitation of payments - those payments meant to facilitate the performance of a “routine governmental action
     * This includes things like obtaining official documents to qualify a person to do business in a foreign country or processing governmental papers, such as visas and work orders
   * Can be liable based on actions taken within the U.S. including telephone calls, wire transfers and interstate travel, as well as those actions outside the U.S. in furtherance of a corrupt payment
     * Thus possible to be held liable for an improper payment authorized by employees operating outside of the U.S. and using money located in foreign accounts
1. **Accounting provision** - requires companies with securities listed on U.S. stock exchanges to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls

### To Whom the FCPA Applies

* Anti-bribery provision applies to:
  * All issuers of securities registered on U.S. exchanges
  * Any company with its principal place of business in, or organized under laws of, the U.S.
  * Any U.S. citizen or resident
* Not only are companies subject to the requirements of the FCPA, but so are officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders acting on behalf of the entity
* 1998 amendments expanded FCPA jurisdiction to include foreign companies if they cause, directly or through agents, an act in furtherance of a corrupt payment to take place within
* Accounting provisions of the FCPA only apply to entities, and individuals acting on behalf of those entities, with securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange

### FCPA Enforcement and Penalties

* Criminal penalties for violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA include fines of up to $2,000,000 for corporations and other business entities and up to $100,000 for officers, directors, stockholders, employees and agents of such entities
  * Fines on individuals cannot be paid by employers
* Additional penalties can be imposed in SEC enforcement actions at the court’s discretion
  * This may include the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to the defendant as a result of the violation (or some specified dollar limitation based on the severity of the violation). Can also seek to enjoin any act or practice of a firm if it appears to violate any FCPA provision
* The way a company responds when suspected violations of the FCPA are discovered has a large influence in whether penalties are imposed by the SEC and DOJ, rendering early detection and analysis of suspected violations critical
