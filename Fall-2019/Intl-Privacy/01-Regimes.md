# Foundations and Principles of Various International Privacy Regimes

## Israel

Israeli data privacy and data protection law is distinct from regimes in the EU and US. While similar to GDPR in some respects, it also differs from the EU in some important ways. The data security requirements imposed by Israel are much more granular than GDPR (Israel is widely recognized as the world leader in Cybersecurity) and its database registration and data export restrictions are arguably more stringent than GDPR. It can also be contrasted with U.S., which relies almost entirely on sectoral-specific information protections, as all information (e.g. medical, financial) are by and large subject to the general privacy regulations (which are then supplemented by some special industry-specific requirements)

### Israeli Privacy Laws

* The primary sources of privacy and data protection law in the State of Israel are the Protection of Privacy Law 1981 (the 'Privacy Law') and the quasi-constitutional Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (the 'Basic Law')
* The Privacy Law protects the privacy of individuals by regulating the storage and dissemination of information relating to individuals, prohibiting infringement of a person's privacy without consent and providing for both civil and criminal liability for such infringement
  * Section 2 identifies activity that violate privacy if consent is not obtained. This includes conduct defined in American privacy torts and more, such as passing on or re-using information about person's private affairs outside the original purpose for collection
  * Also provides specific set of protections for databases containing information that pertains to natural persons
* The Basic Law provides that "every person is entitled to privacy and to the confidentiality of his life" and "there shall be no infringement of the confidentiality of a person's conversations, correspondence and writings."
* Another major development was the enactment of the Protection of Privacy Regulations (Data Security) 2017, which became effective in May 2018. It was intended to supplement existing data security provisions under the Privacy Law, establishing specific and granular requirements with respect to personal data collected and maintained in databases
  * Represented a significant increase in compliance obligations and added a data breach notification requirement for 'serious data breaches.' Under this requirement, the compromised party must immediately notify the Database Registrar, an entity appointed by the government pursuant to the Privacy Law to supervise compliance with provisions of the Privacy Law and the regulations issued thereunder
* Certain sector-specific laws impose obligations of secrecy which, if breached, could constitute an infringement of privacy, such as the Banking Ordinance 1941, the Patients' Rights Law 1996 and the Income Tax Ordinance (new version)

### Israeli Privacy Regulators

* The PPA is the primary regulator for matters relating to privacy and data security. The PPA sits within the Israeli Ministry of Justice, and is headed by the Registrar of Databases
  * The PPA conducts criminal investigations, administrative investigations and audits, publishes guidelines, conducts research and initiates new regulations
  * The PPA has several enforcement tools that are exercised based on the severity of violations. The two primary enforcement mechanisms take the form of a criminal investigation or an administrative enforcement process
  * The Registrar maintains the Registry of Databases and supervises compliance with the Privacy Law and associated regulations
    * A 'database' is defined in the Privacy Law as "a collection of data, stored by magnetic or optical means and intended for computer processing," subject to certain exceptions
    * The Registrar may refuse to register a database if it has reasonable grounds to assume that the database is used or is liable to be used in connection with illegal activities or in violation of the Privacy Law
    * The Registrar is authorized to appoint inspectors, who may demand that a person furnish all information and documents related to a database, and may enter, search and seize objects from any place at which they have a reasonable belief that a database is being operated
* There are also industry-specific regulatory bodies are responsible for implementing and enforcing the unique privacy/security requirements for entities within a respective industry (e.g. Supervisor of Banks, Ministry of Health)

## EU (GDPR)

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant update to Europe's comprehensive privacy law. The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018
  * Strengthens data protection under law, providing new data protection rights to individuals and responsibilities for entities handling personal data

### GDPR Overview

* **Chapter 1: General Provisions**
  * GDPR generally applies when **personal data** of a data subject is processed
    * Personal data is information that can identify an individual (including some pseudonymized data if it can be linked back to an individual, but not fully anonymous data)
    * Certain sensitive data, like biometrics, warrant heightened protection
  * **Processing** is broadly defined and includes may types of activities related to handling data, like collection, transmission, and storage
  * GDPR applies to **controllers**, those who direct the purposes and means of how data is processed, and **processors**, those that actually process the data on behalf of the controller
  * GDPR applies to both the public and private sectors (national security/law enforcement exception. It also applies to **all companies which process European consumers' personal data**. This includes:
    * Companies with an “establishment” in the EU, regardless of where they process personal data. This would mean cloud-based processing performed outside of the EU for an EU-based company is covered
    * Companies that monitor behavior and collect data on subjects who are located within the EU (even if no transactions take place). Generally, these companies will need to appoint a representative in the EU
    * Companies based outside the EU that provide services or goods to the EU (including for free). These companies may also need to appoint representative in the EU

* **Chapter 2: Principles**
  * General Principles for Processing Data - Data must be:
    * Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals
    * Collected for specified, explicit and **legitimate purposes** and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (unless public interest exception)
    * Adequate, relevant and **limited to what is necessary** in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
    * Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; Reasonable steps taken to
    * Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
    * Processed in a manner that **ensures appropriate security** of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss
  * Lawfulness of processing One of six lawful bases for processing must be present before any processing can occur:
    * Consent of the data subject - Made by clear **affirmative action** (opt-in)
    * Contract
    * Legal obligation
    * Vital interests
    * Public interest
    * Legitimate interests - Where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller, except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject)

* **Chapter 3: Rights of the Data Subject**

  * The right to be informed - When their data is collected, data subjects must be informed about the purposes for which the data will be processed, the categories of personal data obtained, how long it will be retained, and more
  * The right of access - Right to information about whether their data is being processed, and, if so, have a right to access their personal data which is being processed
  * The right to rectification - Right to correct their personal data or complete any data which is incomplete
  * The right to erasure - Right to erasure of personal data which has been collected (i.e. a right to be forgotten) in certain circumstances, including that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected
  * The right to restrict processing - Right to request that an entity limit the processing of his or her data in certain circumstances, for instance where the individual alleges the data is incorrect or is being unlawfully processed
  * The right to data portability - Right to obtain their data from a service and transmit it to another service for use
  * The right to object - Data subjects have a right to object to processing based on "legitimate interest", to direct marketing, and to processing for research purposes
  * Rights related to automated decision making and profiling - Special heightened rights when they are profiled or evaluated by some automated process or algorithm, including the right not to be subject to them where it has legal or similarly significant effects or the right to know that they are subject to one
    * Exceptions to data subject's ability to object: Necessary for performing a contract between controller; Authorized by EU or Member state law; Is based on explicit (opt-in) consent; Legitimate grounds that override rights of data subject/legal claims

* **Chapter 4 : Obligations of Controller and Processor**
  * Data protection by design and by default - Technical and organizational measures must be implemented to advance data protection principles
  * EU representative - Entities outside the EU but subject to the GDPR must have a representative in the EU
  * Record-keeping - Records of processing activities must be kept
  * Security of processing - Technical and organizational measures must be implemented to ensure security, like pseudonymization and encryption
  * Notification of data breach - Within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach that poses a risk to individual rights and freedoms, a supervisory authority must be notified. Data subjects must be notified without undue delay
  * Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) - An assessment of the risks to data protection is required processing runs a high risk for individual rights, and must consult a supervisory authority before processing where the DPIA indicates a high risk is no protective measures are taken
  * Data protection officers - DPOs must be appointed to oversee and advise on compliance issues if the entity is a public authorities, or an entity with core activities involving large scale, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals or large scale processing of special categories of data or data concerning criminal convictions and offenses

* **Chapter 5: Transfers of personal data to third countries or international orgs**
  * The transfer of personal data outside the EU is limited unless data protection guarantees under the GDPR will be maintained - such as where commission decides country adequate protections/safeguards and contractual
  * Commission takes into account a number of considerations in assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, including: the country's legislation, respect for freedoms, national security measures, etc
  * In the absence of an adequacy determination, a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country **only if** the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available (usually via contract)

* **Chapter 6: Independent supervisory authorities**
  * Each member state must provide independent supervisory authorities that monitor and enforce GDPR (e.g. through fines, investigations, orders, guidance, etc.). Purpose of this is consistent application of GDPR throughout the EU

* **Chapter 7: Cooperation and consistency**
  * Establishes a system of coordination, information sharing, and assistance between aforementioned supervisory authorities. Creates a consistency mechanism to ensure common approach to enforcement of GDPR. Also establishes a European Data Protection Board, an official body of the EU that will resolve disputes between authorities and work to adopt new guidelines and recommendations

* **Chapter 8: Remedies, liability and penalties**
  * Individuals have the right to lodge complaints with a supervisory authority and a right to challenge in court an authority's legally binding decision concerning them

* **Chapter 9: Provisions relating to specific processing situations**
  * Sets out special standards for specific processing situations, such as how to reconcile protection of personal data with values like transparency, public access, and freedom of expression. This chapter permits (and sometimes requires) member states to set separate rules and conditions for certain specific contexts

* **Chapter 10: Delegated acts and implementing acts**
  * Authorizes European Commission to adopt delegated acts further developing and implementing the GDPR provisions

* **Chapter 11: Final Provisions**
  * Repeals the previous data protection directive and sets date of GDPR's applicability

### Key Changes from the EU Data Protection Directive

* Data processors as well as data controllers are directly liable under GDPR. Under the 1995 Directive, only controllers were directly liable. Data processors are now required to have a contract with data controllers to process personal data

* Slightly expands definition of personal data, which is defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier (e.g. name, uuid, IP, location,)...or to one or more factors specific to the...identity of that person". Under the Directive, personal data was defined as data such as names, photos, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and personal identification numbers (social security, bank account, etc.)

* Two new categories of data, genetic and biometric data, join the prior list of “sensitive” or “special” personal data: data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and data concerning health or sex life and sexual orientation

* Under GDPR, organizations must delete data that is not being used for its original purpose

* Heightened consent requirements. GDPR requires explicit opt-in for the processing of any personal data, and **consent for the use of personal data must be informed, specific, and unambiguous**. Thus, now require clear affirmative action, and individuals can revoke their consent to data processing at any time. Consumers also cannot be asked to agree to contract terms in exchange for their consent

* New rights established
  * Right to access - Gives individuals the right to obtain from data controllers information on how their data is being used, where, and for what purpose. Also entitled to copy of information stored on them, free of charge
  * Right to be forgotten - if a person submits such a request, data controllers must erase and cease all further use of the data

* Along with new documentation requirements, organizations are now required to actively track how and where data is stored and used throughout the supply chain. This entails adopting risk management tools, building security and privacy into their operations by design, and conducting impact assessments on certain activities

* Imposes single uniform breach notification law. Under the Directive, member states were free to adopt their own. Under GDPR controllers must notify their supervisory authority and individuals affected by a personal data breach within 72 hours of learning about the breach and must provide certain details in the notification

* Penalties - For some GDPR violations, such as lacking consent to process data or violating privacy by design, organizations could be charged up to 4% of their global revenue. Other violations such as failing to keep records could see fines up to 2%

* The territorial scope has been increased. The regulation applies to all companies that process personal data of people residing in the EU, regardless of the company’s location

* Other Changes - The minimum age for individuals whose data can be collected rises from 13 to 16. Large data controllers must appoint a data protection officer. There is a single national office for complaints

## GDPR and Transnational Data Flows

A major component of GDPR relates to the treatment of personal data moving between EU member states and third countries or international organization. Recognizing the importance of external data flows in order to maintain international trade and cooperation, the GDPR attempts to address the challenge of preserving these flows without undermining its goals of providing a high level of protection to personal data. The recitals provide additional clarity on how GDPR Article 5 seeks to accomplish this:

* Transfers of personal data to controllers/processors in a third country or international organization (and any transfers of this data thereafter) **can only take place** in full compliance with GDPR's provisions for such transfers
* Agreements- GDPR still allows member states to enter international agreements with third countries related to data flows so long as they don't directly violate GDPR and provide for adequate protection
* Adequacy Decisions - The Commission my decide that an entire third country, territory, sector, or international organization offers an adequate level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the EU that the country/region/organization is considered an adequate data flow destination. In these cases, transfers can occur here without need to obtain further authorization, though the commission reserves right to revoke this status
  * Should take into account clear and objective criteria, such as the countries own applicable legal standards and specific processing activities. The country's guarantees should be similar/equivalent to that of GDPR. Should also take into account respect for the rule of law and international human rights norms/standards
  * Third country should have own independent supervisory authority and data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and redress
* Monitoring decisions - Commission should monitor its adequacy decisions, providing for a periodic review mechanism which takes into account relevant developments. If determined to no longer provide adequate level of protection, it can revoke adequacy decision and prohibit flows
* Appropriate Safeguards - Without adequacy decision, third country controller/processor needs to take steps to compensate by ensuring use of adequate safeguards, such as binding corporate rules or standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority within the EU (or clauses consistent with those adopted by a supervisory authority)
  * These safeguards ensure compliance with data protection requirements and reflect GDPR's core principles
