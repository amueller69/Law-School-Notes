# Introduction to American Antitrust Law

* When we speak about antitrust law, we are broadly referring to competition law
  * The term antitrust came from the structure of early multi-state corporations, based on common law trusts,

## Sherman and Clayton Act

* Sherman Act was first attempt a federally imposed legal limitation on what was at that point a unrestricted range of commercial activity
  * Exercise of commerce clause power under Article II. At this point in history (and until end of the New Deal era), commerce clause jurisprudence interpreted this power very narrowly
  * Though constitution would limit enforcement, the act was nonetheless passed in 1890. It was unenthusiastically and cautiously enforced in the early years of its existence
* Sherman Act ยง 1
* > Every contract, combination, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states ... is to be declared illegal
  * Before conduct can be proved, there must be more than one individual involved and there must be some provable agreement or conspiracy
  * Must be within jurisdictional reach of the act, which is achieved by exercise of the commerce clause. Thus, must affect interstate commerce
  * Conduct in violation of this section is deemed to be both simultaneously subject to criminal and civil liability, though imposing criminal liability requires a demonstration of mens rea (i.e. criminal intent)
* Sherman Act, by its terms, seems to call for economic analysis to determine if its provisions are being violated
  * Example - Restraint of trade is something that would ostensibly be measured by reduction in output
  * A recent trend in antitrust policy that has taken place on the extremes of both sides of the political spectrum is shifting focus from economic power (e.g. impact on consumer welfare) and towards political power
  * Hovenkamp - Important not to lose sight of the purpose of antitrust law, which is not simply a swiss-army knife to solve all of the worlds ails. Antitrust is a tool to address poor economic performance that results from monopolized and noncompetitive markets. In the case of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and the likes, antitrust concerns really seem to be implicated
    * Need to approach antitrust with caution rather than with a sledgehammer, keeping in mind who the antitrust enforcement is intended to protect (i.e. consumers). Breaking up a firm like Amazon could have the effect of raising prices on consumers, harming lower/middle class consumers the most
* Clayton Act was passed in 1914
  * > Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor ... without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold in damages by him sustained and cost of suit including reasonable attorneys fee
  * Public injunction provision - invests power in district courts to prevent and restrain violations of the act and imposes duty US Attorneys under AG to initiate proceedings
  * Private equity provision - Private parties are entitle to sue for injunctive relief against any threatened loss or damage by a violation of antitrust laws
  * Also sought to provide immunity to organized labor

## The Progressive Era

* Defining Trends
  * Rapid demographic realignment, including growth in urban populations in relation the rural as a share of the total of population
  * Rise of Marginalism in place of classical political economics, which saw the emergence of economics as a tool for analyzing and formulating competition policy (among other areas of the law)
  * The rise of the "trust" and consolidation of power and market control within industries
* The "Trusts" - First multi-state corporations
  * In 19th Century corporate law, charters were issued by states. No holding companies or out of state productive assets. Business purpose clauses were limited, an effort to keep corporations from branching out and expanding vertically
    * In order to circumvent these limitations, organizations who wanted to expand multi-state structured their organizations in the form of common law trusts
      * In the common law, a trust is a system in which multiple people place assets under the control of a single board of trustees who manage them for the collective benefit of the various beneficiaries
  * Trust form became obsolete around 1890's. State of NJ had passed expansive legislation which allowed corporations to operate without these limitations. Corporations began flocking to NJ to incorporate
    * Woodrow Wilson repeals this legislation, but Delaware responded by passing there own expansive corporate laws. This is why virtually all large American corporations are incorporated in DE to this day
  * Technological advancements and new production methods allowed firms to achieve economies of scale and become dominant within their respective industry. Displaced smaller firms which could no longer compete

## Monopolies and Concentrated Industry Power

* Historical meanings of "monopoly"
  * "The exclusive privilege of selling something" - English Language dictionary 1766
  * "Sole power of vending any species of good obtained either by engrossing the articles in market by purchase or by a license from the government" - American Dictionary 1828 (demonstrates evolving definition in American law)
* Two accounts as to what lead to the emergence of big business, competing perspectives that come from different ends of the ideological spectrum
  * One perspective saw these effects as benign, an inevitable result of technological development and competitive to achieve economies of scale. This is was seen as a sign of progress, more standardized goods which could be produced at a lower cost
  * Progress critique - Saw the whole problem only in terms of large firms engaging in anti-competitive practices. This as a potential threat to consumer welfare, as the lack of substitutes within markets eroded the power/leverage that consumers had
* Early monopolies weren't those who obtained their market position based on internal capabilities and innovations
  * Instead, early competition law targeted de jure monopolies which have there status because of some sort of authoritative legal rule gives them some advantage (i.e. an economic rent)
  * English monopoly statutes passed in 1623 aimed to eliminate the grant of these exclusive permits, licenses, and privileges, though this did not extend to patents

### Four Rationales for Social Polices Disfavoring Monopoly Power

1. The monopolist's price increase and output reduction transfer wealth away from consumers and to the monopolist
2. Monopoly produces a "deadweight" loss, value that is lost to consumers but is not regained by the monopolist or anyone else
3. The monopolist may spend resources inefficiently in acquiring or maintaining its monopoly position
4. The putative monopolist's exclusionary practices may destroy investments made by victims, mainly the monopolist's competitors

## Cases Involving Early Trusts

### *United States v. American Can Co.*

* Background: Antitrust enforcement brought against American Can Co. who had established dominant position in the market. The company defended itself by arguing its size is not a crime, but the result of natural and legitimate growth
* Court's interpretation: The court instead saw the firm's conduct as a clear attempt to rid the market of competition by coercing/inducing smaller manufacturers to sell. This was evident from the following facts:
  * Both the sums paid for these factories, often more than twice the actual value, and in the agreements which contained a clause that would effectively stop the seller from re-opening a new plant anywhere in the country for at least 15 years indicated an intent to rid the market of competition
  * The fact that consolidating would have also allowed the company to obtain patents for most of the modern machinery and then enter an exclusive licensing agreement with machine manufacturers, preventing any new competitors from obtaining this machinery (which is exactly what happened)
  * Most of the plants were not even operated following their acquisition, but simply scraped and sat empty or sold at salvage price
  * With no competition, prices got so high, it became profitable for small new operations to can the old fashioned way and sell at a lower price. Rather than simply lower its prices, American Can started sending brokers to purchase millions of the competitions cans (many of which were stored and then later sold at higher prices)
* Holding: Court ultimately declines to decree the dissolution of American Can Co.
* Reasoning: While the court was quick to point out the evidence of attempts to rid competition and then subsequently jacking up prices after establishing dominance, it also acknowledged that the company eventually stopped charging unduly high prices.  Thus, the court considered whether the current prices have resulted had it not been for the consolidation. It acknowledged that current margins on cans a were similar to when consolidation started and great strides had since been made to the efficiency of production and quality of the products (many which were a result of standardization and large investments in R&D which may not have happened under competitive conditions). The increased concentration geographically also had less of an impact due the companies ability to promptly ship across the country on demand. Following the price drop, company hadn't manifest any intent to restrain trade in a way harmful to consumers. Hence, the court concludes that the dissolution would doubtfully benefit anybody. However, dismissing on the merits might protect the company from future government action if it were to resume using its market power in a way dangerous to consumers. The court then ends its decisions by imploring Congress some way to address situations like the present in which immediate dissolution is unwarranted but the market control still presents a risk that can't be expediently resolved in the future
