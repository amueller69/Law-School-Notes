# Bankruptcy Estate Exemptions

## Overview of Exemptions

* This involves reduction of the property of the estate (aka what gets kicked out of the estate)
* Rule: everyone gets their state law exemptions. State law exemptions vary considerably state-by-state
* Compromise:
  * There are federal exemptions (522(d)) and state exemptions (522(b)) + other federal exemptions beyond 522(d)
  * You can choose to use these federal exemptions UNLESS your state takes away your ability to choose the federal exemptions. 33 states do NOT allow the choice; 17 do allow the choice. PA is a choice state.

## Key Provisions

### §522(b) State Exemptions & Domiciliary Requirement

* Provides debtor with the ability to choose between the federal and state exemptions, unless their state opts out of the choice
* § 522(b)(3)(A) –provides which state a debtor can use for state exemptions (domiciliary requirement)
* Rule: Debtor must have lived in state for 730 days (2 years) immediately before filing in order to claim that state’s exemptions
  * If debtor hasn’t lived in a single state for 2 years, look where he lived for the 180 days immediately before the 2-year period or for where debtor lived for the majority of the 180-day period

### §522(d) - Federal Exemptions

* §522(d)(1) – Homestead Exemption (15k)
* §522(d)(2) – Motor Vehicle Exemption (2,400, one car)
* §522(d)(3) – Household Goods Exemption (not more than 400 in any item or 8k aggregate)
* §522(d)(4) – Jewelry Exemption (1k)
* §522(d)(5) – Wildcard (800 + up to 7,500 of unused homestead exemption)
  * A debtor may use this for anything; additional homestead exemptions if the homestead exemption in (d)(1) is not completely used
  * Note: sometimes an item is only partially exempt under a particular category but can be fully exempted with the help of the wildcard exemption
* Note: a debtor who cannot qualify for state exemptions because of the domiciliary rule (in §522(b)(3)(A)) are entitled to the federal exemptions listed in (d) as well
  * Skeel: would interpret this as applying to homestead exemption only

### §522(f) - Avoidance of Liens that Impair Exemptions

* Presents the ability for the debtor to avoid some liens that would otherwise impair an exemption the debtor is otherwise entitled to
* Requirements:
  1. Is this type of lien avoidable?
     * Note: debtor cannot avoid consensual liens (mortgages) under §522(f)(1). Can only avoid judicial liens
  2. Does the lien impair an exemption? Use calculation of §522(f)(2)
     * Steps:
       1. 1 Add all property interests (liens) + the exemption (the debtor’s interest in property)
       1. Subtract the property value from (1)
         * Note: the number obtained in (2) is the maximum amount that the debtor can avoid under 522(f)
  * Procedure –start with the lowest level judicial lien and avoid the lowest property lien first. Then move up if there is still some of (2) left. This does not allow you to knock of consensual liens.
  * §522(f)(1)(A): If you have a family law kind of lien that shows up in 523(a)(5) (restrictions on discharge), it cannot be removed under 522(f). This was added post *Ferry*

### §522(n) – Exemption Cap on IRAs

* Provides an exemption cap on IRAs of $1.095 million with rollovers not included in calculating that amount
  * Note: this is an example of a federal exemption that is also provided to debtors who elect for state exemptions bc it is found in the Code outside of §522(d) -federal exemptions

### §522(p) – Time Exception on Homestead Exemption

* Provides a last minute behavior limitation on homestead exemption
* If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months, homestead exemption is capped at 155k

### §522(q) – Securities Law Exception on Homestead Exemption

* Provides a limitation on the Homestead Exemption for violations/alleged violations of securities law
* Debtor’s homestead exemption is capped at 155k if the debtor:
  * (1) Has been convicted of a felony that demonstrates abusive filing or
  * (2) Owes a debt arising from violation of securities law, or fraud related to securities
* Note: there does not necessarily need to be a judgment against the debtor bc 522(q) says “debt arising from” and there is a claim arising from the debt even without a judgment. So if debtor is sued for an alleged violation, his homestead exemption is capped

## Avoidance of Liens that Impair Exemptions

* A debtor can only avoid a lien “to the extent” that it impairs the property. If impairment is less than the value of the lien sought to be avoided, the remaining portion of the lien can be enforced against the property (*Silveira*)
  * Point: use §522(f) to free up the debtor’s exemption. When we avoid a lien, we are making the property interest disappear. We do not avoid the claim. It is simply an unsecured claim now
  * Logic behind 522(f) calculation for how much of a lien can be avoided:
    * Goal is to preserve the full state exemption he was entitled to under state law.
    * Trying to avoid enough liens so that the debtor can use the full exemption allowed under state law
    * If the liens are judicial liens (rather than consensual liens), it is possible to free-up the exemption
    * Note: on the exam, Skeel will put the liens in order of priority (top= 1st priority). When avoiding liens, start with the bottom/lowest priority lien
    * Trying to partially prioritize the exemption
* A debtor can avoid “fixing of a lien” under §522(f)
  * Rule: for a lien to be avoidable, the debtor must have an interest in the property before the lien attached (Ferry)
* Note: Debtor cannot avoid a judicial lien that shows up in §523(a)(5) – domestic support obligations (alimony, support)
  * §522(f) – (a)(5) is explicitly mentioned as a judicial lien that cannot be avoided

### *In re Silveira*

* Facts: debtor owns house worth 157k with a 117k mortgage. Creditor (bank) has a 209k judicial lien on the property. Debtor claims that he is entitled to 15k exemption and can avoid this judicial lien pursuant to 522(f)
* Issue: To what extent can a chapter 7 debtor pursuant to § 522(f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on the debtor’s property when the fair market value of the property exceeds the sum of (1) all consensual liens and (2) the amount of the exemption interest under § 522(d).
* Bankruptcy Provisions:
  * Section § 522(f) -- a lien shall be considered to impair an exemption if the sum of (1) the lien in question, (2) all other liens, and (3) the amount of the exemption exceeds the value of the debtor’s property. In which case, the debtor can seek to avoid the targeted lien
  * However, the court finds that that § 522(f)(1)(A) allows the debtor to avoid only so much of the judicial lien as necessary to prevent impairment of the debtor’s exemption within the meaning of § 522(f)(2)(A).
* Holding: only part of the 209k judicial lien can be avoided under 522(f)
  * Under 522(f)(2)(A) –the sum of (1) the targeted judicial lien (209k), (2) all other liens (117k), and (3) the amount of the debtor’s exemption (15k) (= 342k) exceeds the value of the debtor’s property would have in an unencumbered state (157k) (exceeds that value by 185k)
  * Under 522(f)(1)(A), the debtor may avoid parts of the judicial lien that “impairs” the debtor’s exemption (209-185k = 24k)
* Main Takeaway: **Just because you can avoid part of the judicial lien does not mean that you can avoid all of the lien. “To the extent that” language does NOT mean either/or**

### *Ferry v. Sanderfoot*

* Facts: pre-divorce, husband and wife jointly own their home. When they got divorced, husband retained the house and agreed to pay wife her half of the house’s value over a period of time (unsecured note saying as much). Wife didn’t trust her husband to make these payments and thus obtained a judicial lien securing the debt owed to her. Husband files for bankruptcy, claims the house as exempt property and moved to avoid wife’s judicial lien under 522(f)(1).
* Issue: can husband avoid the wife’s judicial lien under §522(f)?
* Holding: no! Court reads a temporal interpretation of 522(f) – “fixing” read to require a specific time frame.
* Rule: Property interest has to pre-date the fixing of the lien (attachment) in order to potentially avoid it under §522(f)
  * Note: Here, cannot avoid the judicial lien bc the lien and the property interest occurred at the same time. If the husband had owned the property alone before the settlement, the fixing of the judicial lien would occur after the debtor’s property interest was already in place and then the husband could avoid this judicial lien.
* Note: after Ferry, Congress changed 522(f) to include a qualification on avoiding judicial liens. Liens are avoidable other than judicial liens specified in 523(a)(5) –obligations that look like alimony, maintenance, support problems. Congress protected alimony and support obligations by adding it to 522(f), but did not protect property settlement arrangements that are not alimony/support.
* Skeel: there are other ways to fix this problem, such as framing this judicial lien as a consensual lien as opposed to a judicial lien

### Additional Hypotheticals

* HYPO #1
  * Setup: Debtor owns a house that is worth 100k. There is a mortgage that is properly perfected in amount of 70k. There is a judicial lien in amount of 40k. Exemption in the debtor’s state is 50k:
    * House --> worth 100k
    * Mortgage --> 70k
    * Judicial lien --> 40k
    * Exemption --> 50k
      * Note: property interests, as is, exceed the value of the property
  * Issue: How would you determine if debtor could get rid of some of the liens?
  * **Step one: Add all property interests (liens) + the exemption (the debtor’s interest in property)**
    * 70K + 40K + 50K = 160k
  * **Step two: Subtract the value of the house. This number is the maximum amount that the debtor can avoid under 522(f)**
    * 160k - 100k = 60k
    * Start with the lowest level lien (judicial lien) and then move up
    * **This does not allow you to knock of consensual liens** (i.e. the)
  * Here, can remove the full 40k judicial lien. This means that the property interest is now removed, but the 40k judicial lien does not disappear. It simply becomes a 40k unsecured claim. Still owed 40k but now there is no property interest securing that amount
  * Note: assume for our purposes that 522(f) is dealing with avoiding judicial liens only
* HYPO #2
  * Same facts as the first except that instead of a mortgage, there is actually a second judicial lien of 70k. What would happen?
  * Could avoid the first 40k judicial lien. Still have 20k in which we could avoid from the second judicial lien. Therefore making this second judicial lien a 50k
  * Note: this re-writes the second judicial lien. Instead of a full 70k lien, now have a 50k lien. Doesn’t remove the remaining 20k claim, it is now a 20k unsecured claim

## Restrictions on State Homestead Exemptions

* Overview of Restrictions:
  1. Domiciliary Requirement - §522(b)(3)(A)
  1. Restriction Based On When Debtor Bought the Land/House - §522(p)
  1. Restriction Based On Debtor Violating/Being Sued For Violation of Securities Law - §522(q)
* Note: Remember that homestead exemptions are subject to consensual liens (exemptions are subject to any mortgage you might have on the house)

### Domiciliary Requirement - §522(b)(3)(A)

* Rule: Debtor must have lived in state for 730 days (2 years) immediately before filing in order to claim that state’s exemptions
  * If debtor hasn’t lived in a single state for 2 years, look where he lived for the 180 days immediately before the 2-year period or for where debtor lived for the majority of the 180-day period
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: Debtor lived in State A for 30 years and moves to State B on Jan 2, 2012, where he buys a new house in State B. Files for bankruptcy on Jan 1, 2013
    * State A = $25k exemption
    * State B = $100k exemption
  * Question: Which state’s exemption are we going to use?
  * Answer: State A
    * Consider 522(b)(3)(A)
    * Because debtor has not lived in State B for 2 years, apply the exemptions from the state debtor lived in for 180 days before that. If haven’t lived in a single state for the 180 days, it is the state where you lived for the most time
    * Problem: State A exemption only applies to property in State A
    * Solution: 522(b)(3) stand alone sentence– provides federal exemption (found in 522(d)-- 22k) in the event that the state exemption rules/domiciliary rule would lead debtor to nothing Skeel would interpret this as applying to homestead exemption only

### Restriction Based On When Debtor Bought the Land/House - §522(p)

* Rule: If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months, homestead exemption is capped at 160k
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: Debtor moves to TX (state of unlimited homestead exemption)
    * 1/1/02: debtor moves to TX
    * 1/1/09: debtor buys land ($1M)
    * 1/1-6/1/11: debtor builds a 2M house (total value of the house = 3M)
    * 1/1/13: debtor files for bankruptcy
  * How much can the debtor exempt?
    * Look at 522(p) – cap (155k) on homestead exemption
    * If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months, it is capped at 155k.
    * Total: 1M (land bought before 3 yr 4 mo mark)+ 155k. Note: 1M in land will be completely exempt because it was before the 3 + year and the home renovations are subject to the cap

### Restriction Based On Debtor Violating/Being Sued For Violation of Securities Law - §522(q)
  
* Rule: debtor’s homestead exemption is capped at 155k if debtor (1) has been convicted of a felony that demonstrates abusive filing or (2) owes a debt arising from violation of securities law, or fraud related to securities
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: What if the debtor from the previous hypothetical is a hedge fund owner who has engaged in civil securities fraud? Debtor must pay SEC 100k because of it. Case is filed, but there is no judgment.
  * Look at §522(q)(1) – Violations of the securities law...state exemptions
  * Skeel: essentially says if you have been sued by regulators in connection with allegations of fraud, your exemptions are limited to 155k as well (§522(q))
  * Answer: This debtor would be limited to 155k TOTAL under §522(q). Takes away the 1M from above
