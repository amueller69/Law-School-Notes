# Bankruptcy Estate Exemptions

## Overview of Exemptions

* Provisions that shrink the "pie". This involves reduction of the property of the estate (i.e. what gets kicked out of the estate)
* Rationale: Promote a fresh start for the DR -> without property, DR would have a hard time starting over
  * Historically included operational capital like farm equipment
* General rule for determining applicable exemptions: **Everyone gets their state law exemptions**. No state requires use of federal provisions, though some states allow choice between state and federal. State law exemptions vary considerably state-by-state
  * There are federal exemptions (§522(d)) and state exemptions (§522(b)) plus other federal exemptions beyond §522(d)
  * You can choose to use these federal exemptions UNLESS your state takes away your ability to choose the federal exemptions. 33 states do NOT allow the choice; 17 do allow the choice. PA is a choice state
    * This restriction on choice between state/federal provisions is limited to that enumerating applicable property and exemptions (i.e. only §522(d))
  * Why would states force you into state exemptions? There is a strong business concern (e.g. real estate) because they think federal exemptions are too generous and that their stingier state exceptions are better for business

## Key Provisions

### §522(b) State Exemptions & Domiciliary Requirement

* **§522(b)(2)** - Provides debtor with the ability to choose between the federal and state exemptions (unless their state opts out of the choice)
* **§522(b)(3)(A) - Domiciliary Requirement**: Provides which state a debtor can use for state exemptions
  * Rule: Debtor must have lived in state for 730 days (2 years) immediately before filing in order to claim that state’s exemptions
    * If debtor hasn’t lived in a single state for 2 years, look where he lived for the 180 days immediately before the 2-year period or for where debtor lived for the majority of the 180-day period
    * This keeps people in financial from moving to FL or TX for sole purpose of taking advantage of homestead exemption (However,state Homestead Exemption is only effective insofar as one can pay cash for the home. Individual does not have interest in the amount of property that is financed through mortgage)
  * This provision also states that property exempt under non-Bankruptcy Federal Law (i.e. not in subsection (d)) is also exempt

### §522(d) - Federal Exemptions

* **§522(d)(1) – Homestead Exemption** (Not to exceed $23,675 in property used as residence)
* **§522(d)(2) – Motor Vehicle Exemption** (Not to exceed $3,775 in one motor vehicle)
* **§522(d)(3) – Household Goods Exemption** (Not to exceed $600 in any particular item or $12,625 in aggregate)
* **§522(d)(4) – Jewelry Exemption** ($1,600)
* **§522(d)(5) – Wildcard** (Not to exceed $1,250 plus up to $11,850 of any unused amount in homestead exemption)
  * A debtor may use this for anything; additional homestead exemptions if the homestead exemption in (d)(1) is not completely used
  * Note: Sometimes an item is only partially exempt under a particular category but can be fully exempted with the help of the wildcard exemption
* Note: A debtor who cannot qualify for state exemptions because of the domiciliary rule (in §522(b)(3)(A)) are entitled to the federal exemptions listed in §522(d) as well
  * Skeel: Would interpret this as applying to homestead exemption only
* Note: BR Code does not allow debtors to rewrite mortgages
  * This is problematic when value of home becomes significantly less than the mortgage
  * Normal rule for re-org is that creditor has secured claim up to the value of the property and rest is unsecured

### §522(f) - Avoidance of Liens that Impair Exemptions

* Presents the ability for the debtor to avoid some liens that would otherwise impair an exemption the debtor is otherwise entitled to
* **§522(f)(1)(A): Debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor is entitled**
  * Does not apply to consensual liens (e.g. mortgage). Can only avoid judicial liens OR non-possessory, non-purchase money security interest in certain types of property (e.g. household furnishings/goods, animals, tools of trade, health prescriptions, etc.) - definitions of these types of property are included in §522(f)(4)
* **§522(f)(2)(A): Amount of lien that impairs exemption = (all liens on the property (judicial, mortgages, security interest, personal property) + the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim) – debtor’s interest in the property**
* Requirements:
  1. Is this type of lien avoidable?
  2. Does the lien impair an exemption? Use calculation of §522(f)(2)
     * Steps:
       1. 1 Add all property interests (liens) + the exemption (the debtor’s interest in property)
       1. Subtract the property value from (1)
         The resulting amount is the maximum amount that the debtor can avoid under §522(f)
  * Procedure - Start with the lowest level judicial lien and avoid the lowest property lien first. Then move up if there is still some of (2) left
  * §522(f)(1)(A): If you have a family law kind of lien that shows up in §523(a)(5) (restrictions on discharge), it cannot be removed under §522(f). These are domestic support obligations (e.g. alimony, child support) which explicitly says in §523 cannot be avoided. This was added after *Farrey*

### §522(n) – Exemption Cap on IRAs

* Provides an exemption cap on IRAs of $1,283,025 with rollovers not included in calculating that amount
  * Note: This is an example of a federal exemption that is also provided to debtors who elect for state exemptions because it is found in the Code outside of §522(d) federal exemptions

### §522(p) – Time Exception on Homestead Exemption

* Provides a last minute behavior limitation on state Homestead Exemption
* If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months (1215 days), Homestead Exemption is capped at $160,375

### §522(q) – Securities Law Exception on Homestead Exemption

* Provides a limitation on the Homestead Exemption for violations/alleged violations of securities law
* Debtor’s homestead exemption is capped at $155k if the debtor:
  * (1) Has been convicted of a felony that demonstrates abusive filing or
  * (2) Owes a debt arising from violation of securities law, or fraud related to securities
* Note: There does not necessarily need to be a judgment against the debtor because §522(q) says “debt arising from” and there is a claim arising from the debt even without a judgment. So if debtor is sued for an alleged violation, his homestead exemption is capped
  * Felony, on the other hand, requires judgement

## Avoidance of Liens that Impair Exemptions

* A debtor can only avoid a lien “to the extent” that it impairs the property. **If impairment is less than the value of the lien sought to be avoided, the remaining portion of the lien can be enforced against the property** (*Silveira*)
  * Point: Use §522(f) to free up the debtor’s exemption. When we avoid a lien, we are making the property interest disappear - CR still has a claim for the same amount, but it is simply an unsecured claim now
  * Logic behind §522(f) calculation for how much of a lien can be avoided:
    * Goal is to preserve the full state exemption he was entitled to under state law.
    * Trying to avoid enough liens (permitted by §522(f)) so that the debtor can use the full exemption allowed under state law
    * Note: On the exam, Skeel will put the liens in order of priority (top= 1st priority). When avoiding liens, start with the bottom/lowest priority lien
    * Trying to partially prioritize the exemption
* A debtor can avoid “fixing of a lien” under §522(f)
  * Rule: for a lien to be avoidable, the debtor must have an interest in the property before the lien attached (*Farrey*)

### *In re Silveira*

* Facts: Debtor owns house worth $157k with a $117k mortgage. Creditor (bank) has a $209k judicial lien on the property. Debtor claims that he is entitled to $15k exemption and can avoid the entire judicial lien pursuant to §522(f)
* Issue: To what extent can a Chapter 7 debtor, pursuant to §522(f), avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on the debtor’s property when the fair market value of the property exceeds the sum of (1) all consensual liens and (2) the amount of the exemption interest under §§ 522(d)? Should avoidance be partial or total?
* Bankruptcy Provisions:
  * Section § §522(f) -- A lien shall be considered to impair an exemption if the sum of (1) the lien in question, (2) all other liens, and (3) the amount of the exemption exceeds the value of the debtor’s property. In which case, the debtor can seek to avoid the targeted lien
  * However, the court finds that that §522(f)(1)(A) **allows the debtor to avoid only so much of the judicial lien as necessary to prevent impairment of the debtor’s exemption** within the meaning of §§522(f)(2)(A).
* Holding: Only part of the $209k judicial lien can be avoided under §522(f)
  * Under §522(f)(2)(A) – The sum of (1) the targeted judicial lien ($209k), (2) all other liens ($117k), and (3) the amount of the debtor’s exemption (15k) is equal to $341k. This exceeds the value of the debtor’s property would have in an unencumbered state ($157k)by $184k
  * Under §522(f)(1)(A), the debtor may avoid parts of the judicial lien that “impairs” the debtor’s exemption ($209-$184k = $25k). Thus bank still has $25k judicial lien
* Main Takeaway: **Just because you can avoid part of the judicial lien does not mean that you can avoid all of the lien. “To the extent that” language does NOT mean either/or**

### *Farrey v. Sanderfoot*

* Facts: Pre-divorce, husband and wife jointly own their home. When they got divorced, they reach agreement whereby husband retained the house and agreed to pay wife her half of the house’s value over a period of time (unsecured note saying as much). Wife didn’t trust her husband to make these payments and thus obtained a judicial lien as part of divorce decree securing the debt owed to her. Husband files for bankruptcy, and tries to claim the house as exempt property and avoid wife’s judicial lien under §522(f)(1).
* Issue: Can husband avoid the wife’s judicial lien under §522(f)?
* Rule: **A Debtor can only avoid a judicial lien under §522(f) if he had the property interest to which the judicial lien attaches before the lien attached to that interest**
* Holding: No, the husband can't avoid the lien. Court reads §522(f) as having temporal dimension – “fixing” interpreted to require interest in property over specific time frame
  * In order for a lien to be "fixed" to something, that something needs to already exist. A lien cannot be fixed to an interest that the debtor never had
  * Interest did not arise until after the divorce judgement at which time the the lien was simultaneously attached
    * During marriage, husband and wife jointly own 100% of the interest in the property. There is a change in ownership interest at time of divorce. Divorce decree is what created husbands property interest while simultaneously creating lien on the property, thus he never had the this property interest in a state where no judicial lien was attached
    * If the husband had owned the property alone before the settlement, the fixing of the judicial lien would occur after the debtor’s property interest was already in place and then the husband could avoid this judicial lien
* What is potential problem with this reading of §522f?
  * It does not solve all the domestic law implications (Courts don’t want husbands to be relieved of responsibilities to ex-wife)
  * Unintended Consequence of this decision: Anytime the lien arises at the same time as the property interest… this can happen if there is a judicial lien on someone (usually good for 5-10 years), and debtor acquires other property
* Skeel:
  * Even though this is an extremely technical reading of the statute, Court is probably correct here
  * There are other ways to fix this problem, such as framing this judicial lien as a consensual lien as opposed to a judicial lien
    * Could have argued that this is not a judicial lien, but essentially a mortgage, thus not what §522(f) intended to protect. This alternative approach to the case would have lead to the same result without the technical interpretation
* Note: After *Farrey*, Congress changed §522(f) to include a qualification on avoiding judicial liens. Judicial liens are avoidable except those specified in 523(a)(5) – obligations that look like alimony, maintenance, support problems
  * Congress protected alimony and support obligations by adding it to §522(f), but did not protect property settlement arrangements that are not alimony/support, thus this change would not have directly fixed issue in *Farrey*

### Additional Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical #1
  * Setup:
    * House --> market value of  $100k
    * Mortgage --> $70k
    * Judicial lien --> $40k
    * Exemption sought --> $50k
      * Note: Property interests, as is, exceed the value of the property
  * Issue: How would you determine if debtor could get rid of some of the liens?
  * **Step one: Add all property interests (liens) + the exemption (the debtor’s interest in property)**
    * $70K + $40K + $50K = $160k
  * **Step two: Subtract the value of the house. This number is the maximum amount that the debtor can avoid under §522(f)**
    * $160k - $100k = $60k
    * Start with the lowest level lien (judicial lien) and then move up
    * **This does not allow you to knock of consensual liens** (i.e. the mortgage)
      * Drafters wanted to facilitate lending and other agreements that protect creditors from BR - allowing the avoidance of consensual leans would discourage this
  * Here, can remove the full $40k judicial lien. This means that the property interest is now removed, but the $40k judicial lien does not disappear. It simply becomes a $40k unsecured claim. Still owed 40k but now there is no property interest securing that amount
  * Note: assume for our purposes that §522(f) is dealing with avoiding judicial liens only
* Hypothetical #2
  * Same facts as the first except that instead of a mortgage, there is actually a second judicial lien of $70k. What would happen?
  * Could avoid the first $40k judicial lien. Still have $20k in which we could avoid from the second judicial lien. Therefore making this second judicial lien a $50k
  * **Not eliminating the liens, but simply turning them into an unsecured claim (i.e. they lose property interest)**
  * Note: this re-writes the second judicial lien. Instead of a full $70k lien, now have a $50k lien. Doesn’t remove the remaining $20k claim, it is now a $20k unsecured claim
* In-Class Hypothetical #3 (Same as #2 but with slightly different facts)
  * Assets: House - $110k
  * Liens:
    * Judicial Lien #1 - $65k
    * Judicial Lien #2 - $40k
  * Exemptions: $50k
  * Skeel - To figure out how much debtor can avoid, add together largest exemption as well as judicial liens and subtract value of house. Purpose is to free up exemption - designed to come up with amount that would need to be gotten rid of in order to take advantage of the Homestead exemption
    * $65k + $40k + $50k - $110k = $45k

## Restrictions on State Homestead Exemptions

* Overview of Restrictions:
  1. Domiciliary Requirement - §522(b)(3)(A)
  1. Restriction Based On When Debtor Bought the Land/House - §522(p)
  1. Restriction Based On Debtor Violating/Being Sued For Violation of Securities Law - §522(q)
* Note: Remember that homestead exemptions are subject to consensual liens (exemptions are subject to any mortgage you might have on the house)
* Homestead Analysis Flow
  1. Has debtor lived in his current State for 2 years?
     * Yes --> Go to Step 3
     * No --> Go to Step 2
  1. Did debtor live in his current state for the 180 days (or majority thereof) preceding this 2 year period?
     * Yes --> Go to Step 3
     * No --> Use the exemption of state where D resided for majority of 180 days prior to the 2 year period
  1. Has debtor owned residence (i.e. home) for at least 3 years and 4 months?
     * Yes --> No limitation on state Homestead Exemption imposed by federal law
     * No --> State Homestead Exemption is capped at $160,375
* Miscellaneous Homestead Exemption Information
  * Does land, without a house on it, count as a homestead?
    * In Texas, no, there has to be a home on the land!
  * If a person has more than 1 residence, could that person choose which residence to exempt?
    * Person might be restricted by §522(p) and §522(b)
    * Person might be restricted by how the state define “homestead”
    * But it seems like there might be a choice if multiple residences in same state
  * Side note: Home mortgage on a primary residence cannot be restructured in bankruptcy, debtor must repay the mortgage or lose their home. Rationale:
    * If house mortgages could be restructured, people would not be willing to lend, interest rates would go up and it would turn out to be more costly for debtors
    * There has been talk of using eminent domain on the mortgage to restructure the mortgage – cities would use eminent domain to sell interest in a new mortgage and use the profits to repay the old mortgage

### Domiciliary Requirement - §522(b)(3)(A)

* Rule: **Debtor must have lived in state for 730 days (2 years) immediately before filing in order to claim that state’s exemptions**
  * If debtor hasn’t lived in a single state for 2 years, look where he lived for the 180 days immediately before the 2-year period or for where debtor lived for the majority of the 180-day period
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: Debtor lived in State A for 30 years and moves to State B on Jan 2, 2012, where he buys a new house in State B. Files for bankruptcy on Jan 1, 2013
    * State A = $25k exemption
    * State B = $100k exemption
  * Question: Which state’s exemption are we going to use?
  * Answer: State A
    * Consider §522(b)(3)(A)
    * Because debtor has not lived in State B for 2 years, apply the exemptions from the state debtor lived in for 180 days before that. If haven’t lived in a single state for the 180 days, it is the state where you lived for the most time
    * Problem: State A exemption only applies to property in State A
    * Solution: The end §522(b)(3) includes a stand alone sentence which provides federal exemption (found in §522(d) -- 22k) in the event that the state exemption rules/domiciliary rule would make debtor ineligible for any exemption
      * Skeel would interpret this as applying to homestead exemption only - **We interpret §523(b)(3) as homestead specific**
      * This would not preclude debtor from claiming other non-homestead exemptions provided by state law

### Restriction Based On When Debtor Bought the Land/House - §522(p)

* Rule: If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months, homestead exemption is capped at ~ $160k
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: Debtor moves to TX (state of unlimited homestead exemption)
    * 1/1/02: Debtor moves to TX
    * 1/1/09: Debtor buys land ($1M)
    * 1/1-6/1/11: Debtor builds a 2M house (total value of the house = $3M)
    * 1/1/13: Debtor files for bankruptcy
  * How much can the debtor exempt?
    * Look at §522(p) cap on homestead exemption
      * If debtor has not owned land/house for at least 3 years and four months, it is capped at ~ $160k.
    * Total: $1M (land bought before 3 yr 4 mo mark) + $160k
      * Note: $1M in land will be completely exempt because it was before the 3 + year and the home renovations are subject to the cap

### Restriction Based On Debtor Violating/Being Sued For Violation of Securities Law - §522(q)
  
* Rule: Debtor’s homestead exemption is capped at ~160k if debtor (1) has been convicted of a felony that demonstrates abusive filing or (2) owes a debt arising from violation of securities law, or fraud related to securities
* Hypothetical
  * Setup: PG&E violates securities law and case is still pending (litigation filed). CEO purchases house in state with unlimited Homestead exemption for $5 million in cash. Files for BR. Notwithstanding domicility exceptions, how much could CEO claim as exemption?
    * Note: Rich people buy homes with cash partially because mortgages are immune from Homestead exemption
  * Look at §522(q)(1) – Violations of the securities law
    * Skeel: Essentially says if you have been sued by regulators in connection with allegations of fraud, your exemptions are limited to 155k as well (§522(q))
      * Don't actually need a judgement in civil cases. However, felony cases of fraud require conviction
  * Answer: This debtor would be limited to $160k TOTAL under §522(q)
