# Executory Contracts

## Key Provisions

### §365(a)—Trustee (debtor-in-possession) has the power to assume or reject executory contract

* Allows trustee to assume or reject any executory contracts or unexpired leases of debtor
* Must be assumed or rejected in entirety
* Must obtain court’s approval to assume or reject

### §365(b)—Assuming the contract when there is a default

* If the debtor wants to assume (keep) the contract and there has been a breach, the debtor must cure the breach before assuming the contract
* Debtor must provide adequate assurances that he will keep the contract and is capable of fulfilling its terms (or that the third party assigned can perform)
* Note: exception in §365(b)(2) excuses estate from curing non-monetary breaches that are impossible to cure at the time so long as DR provides adequate assurances and otherwise compensates for loss

### §365(c) + (f) – Limits on right to assume or assign contracts (conflict)

* §365(c) – DR cannot assume/assign contracts whenever “applicable law” would bar assignment (limits on when you can assume a contract)
  * Skeel: seems to say you cannot assume if you cannot assign under applicable law
* §365(f) – anti-assignment laws cannot prevent an assignment
  * Skeel: seems to say that debtor can assign contracts even if applicable law says otherwise
* Note: there appears to be a conflict between the two provisions. (f) appears to be expansive, while (c) appears to be very limiting.

### §365(d) – Timing provided for assumption/rejection in Ch. 11 (also applies to Ch. 9, 13)

* In Ch. 11 case, debtor’s decision to assume or reject may be made “at any time before confirmation of a plan”
  * This gives trustee considerable time to consider what to do/what is best for the estate
* 120 day limit for non-residential real property leases if plan is not confirmed sooner than that
  * Retail bankruptcies: often would like to have a little over a year to decide. Typically, retailer uses the holiday season as one last attempt to turn it around. File in January. Would like to go through another holiday season to decide which stores to close. Typically important for commercial real estate leases. Commercial leasors were not happy, persuaded Congress to enact 210 day time limit (7 months)
* Note: can still enforce contract before trustee has officially assumed/rejected the executory contract (see below!)

### §365(e)—Anti-ipso facto provision

* Ipso Facto Clause: clause in a K that says in the event one party files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the K terminates automatically
* (e) invalidates all provisions that terminate or allow termination on bankruptcy or insolvency, meaning that once a debtor files for bankruptcy, the non-debtor party must honor an executory contract or unexpired lease to which the debtor is a party
* Ex: as long as Kmart continues to perform the K post-petition, Kmart’s bankruptcy filing is no excuse for Martha Stewart not to perform
* Exception: §365(e)(2)
* Note: §541(c) also says so

### §365(g) – Effect of rejection of executory contract

* Rejection of an executory contract is treated as a pre-petition claim (covering pre-petition breach)
  * Non-debtor will receive ratable share of assets of the estate that is available to general creditors (treated with unsecured creditor status)
* Note: if a DR assumes a K and THEN rejects it, the non-debtor has a post-petition obligation and is entitled to administrative expense status
  * Why? This is because the time of the breach is when the K was ultimately rejected rather than deemed a pre-petition breach in the ordinary case of a simple rejection

### §365(h)/(i)—Special protection for real estate contracts/leases

* Give the buyer special protection to limit the effect of rejection. Allows buyer to specifically enforce property contracts (to keep property) even if the DR breaches/rejects the contract

### §365(n)—Special protection for intellectual property contracts

* Special case of intellectual property (definition provided in §101(35A))
* Allows licensees (those who pay for license) to retain rights in intellectual property conveyed to them before licensor’s bankruptcy
* Note: overrules *Lubrizol*, instead saying that debtor cannot walk away from conveyance of property interest (license) that has already occurred

## Overview of Executory Contracts

* §365 gives the debtor extraordinary powers that would not otherwise be available outside of bankruptcy and so there is a huge amount at stake (similar to 362)
  * Note: 365 power is a reason to use bankruptcy (there is no available power like this under state law, so settlements outside of bankruptcy do not have this)
* Executory Contracts falls in the middle of estate and claims (2.5)
  * Cross between property of the estate and claims
  * If the debtor assumes K…executory contract is property of the estate (asset of the estate). §365 allows debtor to keep contract even if it has breached it
  * If the debtor rejects K…executory contract becomes a pre-petition claim (unsecured creditor status) that the non-debtor has against the estate

## What Qualifies as an Executory Contract

* Definition: “A contract under which the obligations of both the bankrupt and the counterparty to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.”
* Translation: a contract on which neither party has fully performed its obligation and thus some performance is still due on either side. Skeel says a contract is executory if failure to perform the rest of the contract would amount to a material breach.
* Application: As long as there is an ongoing obligation and some time left on the contract term, a court is likely to determine that the contract is executory even if the obligations left on either side appear somewhat minimal. Although some courts reject the idea that performance due by the debtor can be payment, for our purposes even if the debtor only has to make payments it will still be an executory contract
* Note: classification as executory contract is important because if a contract is NOT executory, the non-debtor party is simply an unsecured creditor

### Is An Entertainer’s Contract An Executory Contract Such That It Can Be Rejected

* Two big cases in the 80s –
  * Tia Carerre. General Hospital—had ABC contract, but got a more lucrative offer that she wanted to take. Wanted to reject contract after filing for bankruptcy.
    * Holding: court did not allow her to reject contract
    * Justification: Idea being that a recording contract is excluded from bankruptcy (§541(a)(6)—future earnings) because it is actually post-petition earnings, so cannot be rejected. Logic being that if it is excluded from the estate, it cannot be dealt with in bankruptcy at all
  * James Taylor (lead singer of cool n the gang) wanted to reject his recording contract after filing for bankruptcy
    * Holding: court DID allow rejection of the contract
* Kurupt case with Death Row Records –
  * Bankruptcy court says look to state law to see if this type of contract would be specifically enforceable. Relevant state was CA.
  * CA law says this issue turns on whether the recording artist is a celebrity at the time of entering into the contract.
    * If celebrity…CANNOT reject
    * If NOT celebrity…Can reject
  * Why? If you are a celebrity, debtor is irreplaceable and contract can be specifically enforced. If you are not a celebrity, you are a dime a dozen and monetary damages can be adequate
  * Court determined Kurupt was NOT a celebrity at the time he entered into the contract. So, he was able to reject the contract.
  * Skeel: this is somewhat backwards logic because the economic model of the music/recording industry takes a huge risk with no-name artists and gets a major payout on the one-in-a-million case where the artist is a success

### Is A Security Interest Ever An Executory Contract

* **No!**
  * Security interests are not executory and cannot ever be rejected under §365
  * Note: security interest stays even if it is tied to a lease that can be rejection (treated as two different contractual obligations)
* Leasing Services Corp. v. First Tennessee Bank (p. 224)
  * Manufacturer has a lease with debtor for equipment where the debtor is supposed to pay over 20 years. There is a security interest. There are still obligations on both sides, so it is executory (debtor –payment; creditor – servicing the equipment for example)
  * Debtor argues this is executory and he has the option to assume/reject (§365(a)). Argues that when debtor rejects this contract, he is also rejecting the security interest
  * BLL: debtor cannot reject security interest that is involved in an executory contract situation.
  * Argument: it is as if there are two separate contracts here. One for the lease; one for the security interest. Idea being that you do not want to be able to reject a perfected security interest.

### Special Protections in §365(h)/(i)/(n)

* *Lubrizol Enterprises Inc. v. Richmond Metal Finishers*
  * Debtor in ch. 11 = RMF
  * Facts: debtor has a licensing agreement with Lubrizol granting L the non-exclusive licensing of its metal coating process technology (basically its only asset). Agreement requires debtor tell L if it licenses to anyone else and give L the best deal. L has to keep the technology secret in return.
  * Debtor wants to reject the contract after filing for bankruptcy
  * Issue: whether debtor should be able to reject as executory a technology licensing agreement with L?
  * K was executory bc of continuing core obligations of notice and forbearance in licensing.
    * Note: contingent duties make a K executory until the time has expired during which an event triggering a contingent duty may occur
  * Rejection would be advantageous to debtor since the technology was debtor’s main asset and the agreement with L would hinder its ability to license and use technology in future
  * Holding: Court lets debtor reject contract
  * L now has an unsecured claim for $20k against debtor (and will most likely only get 10 cents on the dollar for it) under §365(g)
    * Skeel: allowing debtor to reject this contract means that Lubrizol would get a claim for material breach/do contract damages calculation and L would have a claim for that amount. The problem with this is that it would be a pre-petition claim that would be paid off in bankruptcy dollars
  * Note: §365(n) overrules Lubrizol. §365(n) affords leasers of intellectual property special protections in bankruptcy
    * Congress was sympathetic to licensees in IP context because intellectual property rights are different. More similar to real property rights (which are also afforded special protections found in §365(h)/(i))
    * Skeel: distinction between real property rights (real estate, property) and other rights. If the debtor breaches the real property contract, non-debtor is entitled to specific performance. CANNOT do that with other kinds of assets. Argument for specific performance in real estate is that land/real estate is individual/unique and special/cannot be replicated and cannot put a price on it adequately. IP licenses, like real estate, cannot be replicated/monetary damages will not be adequate. IP license is like a partial real estate ownership right. Other argument is that the licensee is typically the big guy with a lot of lobbying power

## Basics of Assumption or Rejection

* If a contract is assumed…it converts the obligations of debtor into obligation of the bankruptcy estate
  * If there is a subsequent failure to perform after assumption, this results in an administrative expense (higher priority)
* If a contract is rejected (formal declaration not to assume contract)…non-debtor is released from his obligation to debtor
  * Non-debtor now has claims under §365(g) and §502(g) –status as an unsecured claim
* Generally the court will defer to a trustee’s decision to assume/reject a contract so long as there is no evidence of bad faith/abuse of discretion, yet court may engage in balancing of equities
  * Court may refuse to go along with trustee’s decision if…
    * The contract is NOT “burdensome” to the debtor/estate
    * The cost of rejection to non-debtor is disproportionate to the benefit received by the estate

## Assumption & Assignment

* Definitions:
  * Assumption: performance of agreement by and to the bankruptcy estate
  * Assignment: performance by and to a third party. Involves the release of bankruptcy estate from further liability on the contract
    * Must assume contract first, then can assign it
  * Note: difference has to do with WHO is performing the agreement
* There are limits on the trustee’s ability to assume and/or assign a contract
  * Limits based on “applicable state law”
  * Other Limits on Assumption (§365(b))
    * If the debtor wants to assume (keep) the contract and there has been a breach, the debtor must cure the breach before assuming the contract
    * Debtor must provide adequate assurances that he will keep the contract and is capable of fulfilling its terms

### Two Approaches to Understanding §365(c)

1. Hypothetical Test (Catapult)
   * Plain language of §365(c)(1)
   * If a contract/lease could NOT be assigned outside of bankruptcy, it cannot be assumed OR assigned inside bankruptcy
   * Skeel: what the provision actually says

2. Actual Test (Majority approach)
   * Looks at what debtor is actually trying to do
   * Assumption is allowed IF it is the debtor/debtor-in-possession who will perform
   * Assumption is NOT allowed if it is the trustee or a third party who will perform the obligation
   * Note: most concerned with personal services contracts (didn’t want third party/trustee to perform the contract)
   * Skeel: even if the contract is un-assignable, it can be assumed so long as the debtor/debtor-in-possession is the one performing
   * Skeel: what the provision SHOULD say

* Note: this circuit split has been going on for years. West Electronics case (Government contract case. Federal law makes government contracts un-assignable) that Skeel’s judge wrote when he was clerking. Trying to figure out how 365(c) and (f) fit together.
  * (c) – If you cannot assign a contract outside of bankruptcy, you cannot assume it inside of bankruptcy
    * People do not like the hypothetical test because all the debtor is trying to do is keep a contract in place. The hypothetical test seems at odds with this goal

### Three Approaches to Understanding Conflict Btw §365(c) & §365(f)

* Note: §365(c) seems to say cannot assume or assign a contract inside bankruptcy that cannot assign outside bankruptcy. §365(f) seems to say that can assign even if applicable law would say otherwise

* **(1) Pioneer Approach**
  * If there is an explicit anti-assignment law outside of bankruptcy  §365(c) controls.
    * Result = Rights cannot be assigned
  * If the restriction on assignment is contracted for (if applicable state law does not take a stance on anti-assignment issue, but otherwise would enforce the K with an anti-assignment provision)  §365(f) controls.
    * Result = Overrides the contractual provision
    * Skeel: Assignment can be allowed when applicable (state) law prohibits assignment simply because the contract does not allow assignment. (aka the state law does not take a stance on assignment, but enforces anti-assignment contract clauses)

* **(2) Catapult Approach**
  * If anti-assignment law /particularized/ identity is material (from the perspective of the law in question)  §365(c) controls
    * Result = cannot be assigned
  * If general anti-assignment law  §365(f) controls
    * Result = can be assigned regardless of applicable state law
  * Catapult would have applied 365c in Pioneer b/c was particularized to car dealerships
* **(3) Bussels Approach**
* Reads §365(f) as overriding restrictions in all instances except when assignment is absolutely banned
* Would say that law in Catapult is absolute

<!-- TABLE -->

### *In Re Catapult Entertainment Inc*

* Perlman  (leases patent rights) Catapult/debtor  MPCAT that is a subsidiary of Mpath (reverse triangular merger) (merged MPCAT into Catapult)
  * If Catapult had merged into MPCAT, would have had to assign patent rights, instead of assuming (these types of contracts would have been unassignable unless non-debtor agrees)
* At the end of the day, Mpath will own all stock of Catapult
  * Why structure the transaction in this way? So that Catapult can make it seem like they are reorganizing (rather than being sold). If they did this as a sale, cannot assign patent rights. But if this is a reorganization, Catapult can assume this contract (does not need to assign it) because Catapult is theoretically not going anywhere/can still be seen as the one who is performing on the obligation. Logic being that under the actual test, this would be fine. Didn’t end up working because the court adopted the hypothetical test instead.
    * Actual test: if anti-assignment law outside of bankruptcy exists, you can’t assign it, but you can probably assume (if you are the debtor or debtor in possession, but not the trustee or transferee)
* Trustee cannot because Skeel can’t assume Kurupt’s contract
* Issue: whether a Ch. 11 debtor-in-possession may assume nonexclusive patent licenses over a licensor’s objection under §365(c )(1)?
* Holding: debtor not able to assume the contract
* Ct adopts Hypothetical Test (sticking to plain language of §365(c )(1)) to determine whether assumption is possible….
  * A debtor/debtor-in-possession may not assume an executory contract over the non-debtor’s objection if applicable law would bar assignment to a hypothetical third party, even where the debtor in possession has no intention of assigning the contract in question to any such third party
  * Here, the “applicable law” is federal patent law, which says that non-exclusive patent licenses are personal and assignable only with the consent of the licensor

### *In re Pioneer Ford Sales*

* Facts: dealership wants to sell his Ford franchise to a Toyota dealor, but Ford objects. Debtor wants to assign franchise K over Ford’s objection. RI law (applicable state law) provides car manufacturers with a veto on sales of franchises, except “consent shall not be unreasonably withheld”/veto should not be abused. RI provides this ability even if K prohibits assignment
* Issue: can debtor assign K over objections?
* Holding: K was non-assignable. Toyota dealership had little working capital and thus the veto was reasonable
* Pioneer Approach to Assignment:
  * If there is an explicit anti-assignment law outside of bankruptcy (here, RI law for manufacturers)  §365(c) controls. Rights cannot be assumed OR assigned
  * If the restriction on assignment is contracted for  §365(f) controls. Overrides the contractual provision

### Hypothetical - State Restriction on Assignment

* Setup: PA state law says “assignment is not allowed, without the consent of the debtor”
* How would this play out under the three different approaches?
  * Under Pioneer, this law would NOT be overridden (§365(c) would apply) because in this instance the state has taken an anti-assignment stance
  * Under Catapult, this law would be overridden under §365(f) because it is a general anti-assignment law that is not particular/tied to the debtor’s indemnity being important
  * Under Bussel, this law would most likely be absolute/not assignable

## Skeel’s Four Test To Determine Whether DR Can Assume A Contract

1. Which approach to the anti-assignment law (conflict btwn (c) and (f)) are we using?
   * Pioneer;
   * Catapult;
   * Bussel
2. Can the debtor assign the contract?
   * If can be assigned…can be assumed!!!
   * If cannot be assigned…question 3
3. Can the debtor nevertheless assume the contract even if the contract can’t be assigned?
   * Hypothetical Test
   * Actual Test
4. Apply the appropriate test from question 3
   * Hypothetical Test…CANNOT assume contract
     * Note: interprets (c) to say that if you cannot assign contract outside of bankruptcy, you cannot assume contract inside bankruptcy
   * Actual Test…CAN assume it in bankruptcy if debtor or debtor-in-possession is the one assuming it (NOT trustee or third party)
5. Is the assumption proper? Can the debtor fulfill the obligations for assuming K?

## Damages & Enforcement Before Assumption/Rejection

* Rule: until the debtor has assumed, a contract is non-enforceable against the estate. Yet, debtor can enforce K against non-debtor before assumption. If debtor enforces, this does NOT mean the contract has been assumed
* Essentially, creditor must perform K between filing of bankruptcy and confirmation of plan. The expenses incurred during this time are treated as a post-petition obligation (administrative expense status)
* Scenarios
  * Debtor enforces K in the period between filing and confirmation, and decides to assume executory contract
    * Creditor has administrative expense claims for both
  * Debtor enforces K in the period between filing and confirmation, and decides to reject executory contract
    * Creditor has an administrative claim for the expenses of enforcement between filing and confirmation (post-petition obligation)
    * Creditor has unsecured claims for damages from executory contract (pre-petition claims)
  * Debtor enforces K in the period between filing and confirmation, decides to assume executory contract but ultimately changes its mind and rejects
    * Here, both pre-petition and post-petition obligations are treated as administrative expenses

### *Matter of Whitcomb & Keller Mortgage Co*

* Debtor = W&K
* Facts: creditor (D&L) had a data processing lease with debtor in which creditor provided computer services to debtor. When debtor filed for bankruptcy, creditor tried to terminate the contract. Debtor sought injunction forcing creditor to provide computer services between filing of bankruptcy petition and confirmation of their Ch. 11 plan. Debtor took a long time to decide whether to assume/reject the executory K. Lower court allowed injunction, required creditor to continue providing in the interim
* Holding: affirmed providing debtor with injunction requiring creditor to continue performance of K in the interim
  * Debtor did NOT assume the executory contract, but rather was entitled to an did reject the contract eventually
  * Creditor’s pre-petition claim is an unsecured claim
  * Creditor was adequately protected (debtor paid post-petition obligations in full)
* Note: somewhat controversial case bc this requires the dramatic step of requiring the non-debtor to continue performing

### Expenses Hypothetical

* 10k owned to CR at the time of bankruptcy filing.
* 20k owned to CR incurred post filing, but before deciding to assume the contract
* Question: what is the status of the 30k owned to the CR?
  * 20k is an administrative expense. Technically to get administrative expense status you have to satisfy §503.
  * 10k is administrative expense here
    * Logic: §365(g) – when the breach is treated as having occurred. Here, at the time of actual rejection (post-petition)
    * Note: if the debtor just rejects the contract, the 10k would be an unsecured claim
  * RULE: everything post petition gets administrative expense status (needs to be paid in full in cash before confirmation)
