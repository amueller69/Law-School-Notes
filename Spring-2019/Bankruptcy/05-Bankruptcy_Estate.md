# The Bankruptcy Estate -- Property Of The Estate

Butner Rule - Whatever property rights look like outside bankruptcy is how they should like during bankruptcy. Property rights should be preserved

## Key Provisions

### §541 -- Defining Property of the Estate

* Property of Estate - Pool of assets available to satisfy creditors’ claims
  * Ch. 7: Trustee liquidates property of estate and distributes proceeds
  * Ch. 11 & 13: Debtor may retain assets during reorganization (Ch. 11) or rehabilitation (Ch. 13), but debtor’s plan must give creditors as much value as they would have received under Ch. 7
* The estate includes:
  * Property described in 541(a)
  * Certain kinds of property acquired by the DR within 180 days after the date of bankruptcy, and
  * Property that the trustee brings into the estate by exercising his avoiding powers

* **§541(a) -- Explicitly brings most of debtor's property into the estate**
  * **§541(a)(1)** -- “All legal and equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case”
    * Equitable interests = Something that is not in the debtor’s name but the debtor is the equitable owner. Something the debtor pays for and enjoys ownership rights of
      * Ex: daughter purchases car taking out a loan bc her father couldn’t qualify for the loan. Although the car is in the daughter’s name, the father pays for it and is the only one to use it
    * Legal interest = merely a legal title with no rights of ownership
      * This comes into the estate, but there is no value there for the trustee/creditors bc someone else has the valuable rights in the property
      * Ex: grandson has a joint banking account with grandmother. It is solely grandmother’s money and used solely for grandmother’s benefit
    * Note: Court can compel a secured creditor to return repossessed property PROVIDED THAT the creditor’s interest in the collateral is adequately protected AND the debtor has more than a minor interest in the property
  * 541(a)(2): Community property
  * **§541(a)(3)** – mechanism for trustee to use avoidance powers to bring property into estate. If the trustee uses the preference powers, that property comes into the interest of estate
* §541(a)(5) -- Property of the estate includes any property that the debtor acquires or will acquire within 180 days of filing
  * Key property for bequest, devise, inheritance, the magic day will be 180 days after filing
* §541(a)(6) –any proceeds of the estate that arise after filing come in 
  * Includes profits a company makes after filing; if DR owns equipment and sells it then the money would be labeled proceeds; rents (if DR = apartment complex) 
  * EXCEPTION: individual earnings
    * Point: with individuals (ch. 7), the filing of bankruptcy cuts off what is available for creditors
    * Fresh start principle:
      1. Discharge pre-bankruptcy obligations
      1. Future earnings are not available for creditors (§541(a)(6))
      1. Exemptions that creditors do not have access to (522)
* §541(a)(7) – property other than wages acquired while the case is ongoing becomes property of the estate

### §541(b) -- What is NOT property of the estate

* **(b)(5)** - Retirement accounts
* **(b)(7)** - Social Security and related provisions from Employer to debtor employee
* Remember: Future earnings are not available for creditors in Ch. 7 liquidation case 
(§541(a)(6))
§541(c)(1)(A) –property comes into the estate regardless of any restrictions on the agreement
•	Yet, note that the property comes into the estate subject to those same restrictions 
•	Example: Debtor is a member of an exclusive social club. Debtor can sell this membership (worth 500k), but there is a constraint on the sale (3/4 of the other members must approve of the sale or it doesn’t go through). This membership becomes property of the estate, but any transfer of ownership/sale embarked on by the trustee in the Ch. 7 liquidation is still subject to the original limitations 
•	Rule: the debtor’s interest in the property is no greater inside bankruptcy than outside of bankruptcy 
§ 542(a) – requirement to turnover property that the trustee can sell, use, or lease under §363 
•	Note: this provision has been interpreted liberally (Whiting Pools). In situations in which a creditor has already seized the debtor’s property but hasn’t completed the transaction (ie the debtor has a remaining equity of redemption interest in the property), the debtor has the right to get all of the seized property back 


### US v. Whiting Pools, Inc

* Facts: Debtor owed $98K in FICA taxes and federal taxes withheld from EEs, failed to respond for requests for payment by IRS. A tax lien in that amount attached to all of Whiting’s property. Then, IRS seized Whiting’s tangible and personal property - equipment, vehicles and office supplies pursuant to levy provision of IRC. Whiting files for BK the next day (before a tax sale), claims he needs seized property to reorganize his business
* Issue: whether §542(a) authorized the Bankruptcy court to subject the IRS to a turnover order with respect to the seized property
  * Essentially whether the seized property comes into the estate?
  * Note: Not determining whether the property stays in the estate necessarily. IRS can ask for the stay to be lifted if the debtor’s interest is not substantial in this property. §362(d)(2)
* Rule (majority rule): Where a creditor has previously seized the debtor’s property but hasn’t completed the transaction, debtor (Whiting Pool) has the right to redeem the property so long as debtor has any interest in the property
  * Here, the bare ownership right/right of redemption on property was enough to require IRS to turnover the property to the estate 
* Dissent (minority view): the only right debtor has to the property is the right of redemption (bare ownership right). This is the only right that should be included in the estate
* Take Away: this decision shows how far the property of the estate will go
* Thought Question: would the logic be the same in Ch. 7 as well as Ch. 11? YES!
  * There is a strong argument that the seized property would be valuable in the case of liquidation bankruptcy because it allows the property to be sold in a package that might arguably be more valuable than piecemeal sales and debtor may have more incentive to get a good price for it than creditor does (mostly treated this way by courts); turnover is mostly to facilitate reorganization, as going concern value is higher than value in liquidation
  * Yet, it is possible that this logic will not be applied in an average liquidation where the value of the seized property to the creditor who already seized it is more than the foreclosure amount that would otherwise be received by that creditor

  * Expansive view of 542. Extends past creditor's bargain theory with respect to what bankruptcy is intended to accomplish
    * Leaves open the application of this interpretation to Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
      * It might appear that this is not as important in Chapter 7 because it is concerned with liquidation and instead of reorganization
      * However, you would lose difference in value between what could be obtained by the trustee in liquidating the asset and the value of the lien
