# The Bankruptcy Estate -- Property Of The Estate

## Key Provisions

### §541(a) -- Explicitly brings most of debtor's property into the estate**

* Any property/ ownerships interests debtor has becomes part of debtor estate; court has control over it and it becomes potentially available to creditors
* **§541(a)(1)** -- “All legal and equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case”
  * **Equitable Interests** = Something that is not in the debtor’s name but the debtor is the equitable owner. Something the debtor pays for and enjoys ownership rights of
    * Example: Daughter purchases car taking out a loan bc her father couldn’t qualify for the loan. Although the car is in the daughter’s name, the father pays for it and is the only one to use it
  * **Legal Interest** = merely a legal title with no rights of ownership
    * This comes into the estate, but there is no value there for the trustee/creditors bc someone else has the valuable rights in the property
    * Example: Grandson has a joint banking account with grandmother. It is solely grandmother’s money and used solely for grandmother’s benefit
  * Note: Court can compel a secured creditor to return repossessed property PROVIDED THAT the creditor’s interest in the collateral is adequately protected AND the debtor has more than a minor interest in the property
* §541(a)(2): Community property (Doesn't concern us)
* **§541(a)(3)** – Any interest in property that the trustee recovers
  * Mechanism for trustee to use avoidance powers to bring property into estate. If the trustee uses the preference powers, that property comes into the interest of estate. Fraudulent conveyances and wiped on non-perfected interests also return to estate
* **§541(a)(5)** -- Property of the estate includes any property that the debtor had interest in at time of filing petition OR interests will acquire within 180 days of filing if that property is acquired by:
  * Bequest, devise, inheritance
  * Result of property settlement agreement with spouse or divorce decree
  * As beneficiary of life insurance policy or death benefit plan
  * Inheritances, property settlements, proceeds of life insurance settlements, etc.
  * Rationale:
    * Avoid abuse where debtor keeps an inheritance, divorce settlement, life insurance proceeds for themselves
      * Example: Debtor files for bankruptcy when their relative is about to die, but debtor has not yet received interest in the inheritance
    * Why 180 days specifically?
      * Chapter 7 case could end in less than 180 days, in which case the inheritance, life insurance, etc. would still enter into estate and be distributed among creditors retroactively
* **§541(a)(6)** – Any proceeds of the estate that arise after filing come in
  * Includes profits a company makes after filing; if DR owns equipment and sells it then the money would be labeled proceeds; rents (if DR = apartment complex)
  * EXCEPTION: **earnings from services performed by individual debtor post-petition**
    * Point: with individuals (ch. 7), the filing of bankruptcy cuts off what is available for creditors
    * Fresh start principle:
      1. Discharge pre-bankruptcy obligations
      1. Future earnings are not available for creditors (§541(a)(6))
      1. Exemptions that creditors do not have access to (522)
* **§541(a)(7)** – Property interests other than individual earnings acquired while the case is ongoing becomes property of the estate

### §541(b) -- What is NOT property of the estate

* Property of the estate does not include:
  * (b)(1) - Any power that the debtor may exercise solely for the benefit of an entity other than the debtor
  * (b)(5) - Retirement accounts
  * (b)(7) - Social Security and related provisions from Employer to debtor employee
  * Remember: Future earnings are not available for creditors in Ch. 7 liquidation case (§541(a)(6))

### §541(c)(1) - Property comes into the estate regardless of any restrictions on the agreement

* An interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate notwithstanding any provision in an agreement, transfer instrument, or applicable non-bankruptcy law that: **(A)** restricts/conditions transfer of such interest; OR **(B)** conditioned on DR's insolvency, BR commencement, or appointment of trustee and effects/gives option to effect a forfeiture/modification of DR's property interest
  * Exception: **A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this title**
    * Rule: **the debtor’s interest in the property is no greater inside bankruptcy than outside of bankruptcy**
* Yet, note that **the property comes into the estate subject to those same restrictions**
  * See Club Membership Hypo below

### §542(a) – Turnover of property to the estate

* Except as provided in subsection (c - good faith transfer without notice/knowledge) or (d - automatic transfer by pre-petition life insurance contract), an entity, other than a custodian, in possession/control of property that can be sold/used/leased by trustee (§363) or exempted by DR under §552, shall deliver property (or value thereof) to trustee unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate
  * Note: This provision has been interpreted liberally (*Whiting Pools*). In situations in which a creditor has already seized the debtor’s property but hasn’t completed the transaction (ie the debtor has a remaining equity of redemption interest in the property), the debtor has the right to get all of the seized property back

### §544, §547, and §548  - Expansion of the Estate

* §544: Trustee can void unperfected security interest
  * Frees up property; gives debtor full legal interest in property debtor had given to a creditor
  * Does not make claim go away – just no longer a property right securing the claim
* §547: Preference provision
  * Transfers made to creditor within 90 days of Bankruptcy are preferential
  * Idea here is that if one creditor getting paid right before Bankruptcy, seems suspicious
* §548: Fraudulent conveyances
  * Fraudulent conveyance: debtor transfers property to someone, because debtor would rather they have property than the debtor’s creditors
  * If trustee can prove you were trying to defraud creditors – actual fraud
  * If transaction is for less than a reasonably equivalent value (selling something for amount not near what it is worth) – constructive fraud
  * Ex: Ponzi scheme. Pretends to be operating successful business, uses money from new investors to pay the old

## Included as Property of the Estate

* Property of Estate - Pool of assets available to satisfy creditors’ claims
  * Ch. 7: Trustee liquidates property of estate and distributes proceeds
  * Ch. 11 & 13: Debtor may retain assets during reorganization (Ch. 11) or rehabilitation (Ch. 13), but debtor’s plan must give creditors as much value as they would have received under Ch. 7
* General Rule:
  * (1) Property described in §541(a);
  * (2) Certain kinds of property acquired by the debtor within 180 days after filing;
  * (3) Property the trustee brings into the estate by exercising his avoidance powers  
* Property of the debtor wherever located and by whomever held
* Sometimes property of the estate is not in the possession of the debtor. 541(a) may allow trustee to recover possession
* To a limited extent, property of the estate can also include some property of the debtor transferred before the start of bankruptcy (§541(a)(3)-(7))
* Only the interests the debtor has in the property is included in the estate. **If debtor has no real interest in the property, it does not come into the estate** (as we will see in *Whiting Pools*, what constitutes a "real interest" is very broad)
* If debtor has a partial interest in something, only the partial interest comes into the estate
  * Example: if debtor has a two-week timeshare in property elsewhere. The timeshare comes into the estate, but not the whole timeshare just the two-weeks.
  * Example: Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
    * Lehman had subsidiary corporations all over the world, though cash from subsidiaries would flow to NY
    * When they filed for bankruptcy, there was a ton of cash in the NY headquarters that had been routed from subsidiaries
    * The stay applied to the cash, but ultimately Lehman did not have any right to the cash and it was not part of the estate. Why?
      * Lehman only had a **managerial interest** (power to manage the cash, not to have the cash itself), as opposed to an ownership interest and **only property that debtor has an ownership interest in comes into estate**
* Remember: The bankruptcy estate is expanded by trustee preference powers, fraudulent conveyance powers, etc and reduced by debtor’s exemptions
  * Some or all of property in the estate may lose its status as property of the estate
    * Can be claimed by a debtor as exempt property (§522)
    * Can be abandoned or released to debtor under §554
    * Note: if debtor receives property thru 522 or 554, it is now considered property of the debtor rather than property of the estate

### Club Membership Hypothetical

* Setup: Debtor is member of club, membership worth $500k - Debtor can sell that membership, but ¾ of the other members have to approve the sale or the sale does not go through. Debtor files for Ch. 7. Trustee wants to argue that this membership is property of the estate; finds a buyer willing to purchase it for 500k. Trustee not sure ¾ of members will agree
* Does any interest come into the estate?
  * YES – If debtor has an interest in something of value, that comes in. **When it comes into the estate, it does so with exactly the conditions it has outside of Bankruptcy**
* Here: Debtor has an interest that is conditioned on the approval of the other club members. Inside Bankruptcy, as well as outside.
  * The restrictions on this interest outside of Bankruptcy does not prevent it from coming into the estate. The provision tells us it comes in, subject to those restrictions that apply outside of Bankruptcy
  * This is an application of the Butner principle (and codification of Chicago Trade case)
* §541(c)(1)(A) – Existence of restrictions (like 3/4 vote) does not prevent property from coming into the estate, but Trustee must still honor these restrictions
* Note: in a situation where ¾ of the partners of the law firm have to agree to a bonus, or it does not happen  there is no current entitlement to a bonus. There is an argument that this property should not come into the estate at all. Distinction between this and the club membership hypo

### Summary Hypo

* Setup: Debtor works for a law firm making 160k and at the end of the year gets a 60k bonus. Start on Jan 1 and on Dec 31 get the bonus if continue to work there. On Dec 1, filed for ch.7 bankruptcy. While bankruptcy is going on, gets the bonus. Is the bonus property of the estate?
* Argument for it to be included in the estate:
  * Bonus is pro-rated
  * In this case 11/12 of it would be pre-petition property included as property of the estate. 1/12 wouldn’t be bc it was earned after filing (if it was earned pre-petition it would be included even if it was paid after filing)
    * 11/12 of the bonus was rooted pre-petition (what matters is when you earned it, not when it was paid)
  * 541(a)(6) –any wage-related property earned after filing is NOT property of the estate
  * Note: if the bonus is framed as calculated based on the number of months you work there for the year, it would be property of the estate
* Argument for it to NOT be included in the estate:
  * Could look at the bonus earned only on Dec. 31 and don’t care if you were working for each of those months
* What if…3/4 of the partners have to agree for the bonus to be given?
  * No contractual right to the bonus, which suggests that there is no current entitlement to the bonus at the time of filing
  * Note: not dispositive, could still be considered part of the estate
## Butner Rule

### Unless the bankruptcy code says otherwise, state law applies in bankruptcy

* Basic rule with property - contours of property are defined by state law. Yet, Bankruptcy provision that is specifically on point will trump state law
  * Unless BR Code says otherwise, state law or non-BR law controls on a specific question of law
  * Makes clear that we care about Article 9 of UCC
* Whatever property rights look like outside bankruptcy is how they should like during bankruptcy. Property rights should be preserved
* Rationale: The doctrine is at the heart of the Jackson’s creditor-bargaining theory – bankruptcy should create collective proceedings, but shouldn’t otherwise affect non-bankruptcy laws
* Note: Substantive property rights are governed in large part by state law, but **procedural** rights are prescribed entirely by federal bankruptcy law

### *Butner v. US*

* Issue: Who is entitled to rents collected during the period between bankruptcy and the foreclosure sale? Is this determined by federal rule of equity or by the law of the State where the property is located?
  * Under NC law, a mortgagor is deemed owner of the land subject to the mortgage and is entitled to rents and profits, even after default, so long as he retains possession.
  * In title states, the mortgagee is automatically entitled to possession of the property and has a secured interest in the rents.  In most states, the mortgagee’s right to rents is dependent upon taking actual or constructive possession by means of foreclosure, the appointment of a receiver or some similar legal proceeding.
* Holding: Substantive rights of the parties in bankruptcy are determined by otherwise applicable law (state law) unless a specific bankruptcy provision alters those rules
  * Note: Section 552(b)(2) was added after the case -- now provides that real property rents are treated as cash collateral in bankruptcy cases nationwide without regard to the idiosyncracies of state law

## Turnover

* If someone else (a third party) is in possession of the debtor’s property at the time of bankruptcy, can ask for a turnover of debtor’s assets and third party must comply

### *US v. Whiting Pools, Inc*

* Facts: Debtor owed $98K in FICA taxes and federal taxes withheld from EEs, failed to respond for requests for payment by IRS. A tax lien in that amount attached to all of Whiting’s property. Then, IRS seized Whiting’s tangible and personal property - equipment, vehicles and office supplies pursuant to levy provision of IRC. Whiting files for Ch 11. the next day (before a tax sale), claims he needs seized property to reorganize his business. Ownership had not yet transferred pending the sale
* Issue: Whether §542(a) authorized the Bankruptcy court to subject the IRS to a turnover order with respect to the seized property
  * Does this seized property come into the estate?
    * Outside Bankruptcy, Whiting Pool could have cured its taxes before IRS sold the equipment and it would have had the right to get the equipment back (right of redemption)
    * Applying Butner Doctrine (out of bankruptcy must equal in bankruptcy result): Inside bankruptcy, Debtor would have the right to require turnover of the property, conditioned on debtor paying off the lien on the property
  * Note: Not determining whether the property stays in the estate necessarily. IRS can ask for the stay to be lifted if the debtor’s interest is not substantial in this property via §362(d)(2)
* Rule (majority rule): Where a creditor has previously seized the debtor’s property but hasn’t completed the transaction, debtor (*Whiting Pool*) has the right to redeem the property so long as debtor has any interest in the property
  * Here, the **bare ownership right/right of redemption on property was enough to require turnover of the property to the estate**
  * Whiting Pools Doctrine - If debtor has any interest in property (i.e. equity in property > value of lien), §542 applies
* Dissent (minority view): The only right debtor has to the property is the right of redemption (bare ownership right). This is the only right that should be included in the estate
* Take Away: This decision shows how far the property of the estate extends
  * Expansive view of §542
    * Arguably extends past creditor's bargain theory with respect to what bankruptcy is intended to accomplish
  * Leaves open the application of this interpretation to Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
* Thought Question: Would the logic be the same in Ch. 7 as well as Ch. 11? YES!
  * It might appear that this is not as important in Chapter 7 because it is concerned with liquidation and instead of reorganization, thus the property is going to be sold anyway
  * However, there is a strong argument that the seized property would be valuable in the case of liquidation bankruptcy because it allows the property to be sold in a package that might arguably be more valuable than piecemeal sales and debtor may have more incentive to get a good price for it than creditor does (mostly treated this way by courts); turnover is mostly to facilitate reorganization, as going concern value is higher than value in liquidation
    * You would lose difference in value between what could be obtained by the trustee in liquidation and the value of the lien
  * Yet, it is possible that this logic will not be applied in an average liquidation where the value of the seized property to the creditor who already seized it is more than the foreclosure amount that would otherwise be received by that creditor
