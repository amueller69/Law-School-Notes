## Key Provisions

### §109 – Eligibility

* §109(a) - **General provision for who qualifies as a "debtor"**
  * "Only a person that resides in the United States, or has a domicile, a place of business, or a property in the United States, or a municipality, may be a debtor under this title
  * Thus any person that resides or has a domicile, place of business, or property in the United States is eligible to be a DR under the Bankruptcy Code
  
* §109(b) - **Who can file as a debtor under chapter 7**
  * Who qualifies for 7 (and therefore for 11)? A person can be a debtor under Chapter 7 unless it is a: (1) railroad; (2) a commercial bank or domestic insurance company; or (3) a foreign commercial bank or insurance company that does business in the U.S.
    * A **"Person"** (defined in §101(41)) includes individuals, partnerships, or corporations
    * A "**Corporation**'(defined in §101(9)) includes business trusts. Definition of "corporation" is expansive and includes most entities with the characteristics of a private corporation (except for limited partnerships)
      * A trust must actually be engaged in some sort of business to qualify as a "business trust" for bankruptcy purposes.Holding companies, land trusts, or trusts created solely to maintain assets do not qualify as "business trusts" and are not eligible for bankruptcy
    * **Exclusions in Chapter 7**:
      * Provision is designed to **exclude commercial banks and insurance companies from bankruptcy entirely**
        * Why? We already have a regulatory system that deals with banks and insurance companies; they also have possession of other people's money
        * Although commercial insurance companies are excluded from Chapter 11 and 7, any related/affiliate company is not excluded and could file for bankruptcy – when a subsidiary files the Bankruptcy Court ends up dealing with the holding company as a whole
      * Also excludes **Railroads**
        * Chapter 7 mandates liquidation and we don't want railroads liquidating in bankruptcy, we want them reorganizing – this was especially important when railroads were the primary mode of commerce/trade
  
* §109(c) - Who can file as a debtor under chapter 9? Insolvent municipalities
  
* §109(d) - **Who can file as a debtor under chapter 11?**
  * Only a railroad, a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title (except a stockbroker or a commodity broker), an uninsured State member bank, or a corporation may be a DR under Chapter 11
  * You have to be able file for chapter 7 to file for chapter 11
    * Carve out for Railroads - they only go into Chapter 11
  * Exception for stockbrokers/commodity broker: stockbrokers/commodity brokers (i.e. an investment banks) are not allowed to reorganize, but can liquidate (can file for Ch. 7, but not 11)
    * Why? Logic is that investment banks have other people's money and it might be tough to sort out who gets what/customer money might get lost. Customers are vulnerable and need protection (highest priority) and chapter 11 would be messy and compromise those accounts. If IB fails, we don't want to go through re-org, but rather take out customer accounts and liquidate
    * Note that investment banks can put subsidiaries/holding companies in chapter 11. Example - Lehman sold its IB subsidiaries to Barclays and filed Chap. 11 for remaining non-IB subsidiaries. IB subsidiaries filed for Ch. 7 after sale to Barclays

### §301 - Voluntary Bankruptcy Filing

* §301 – Voluntary bankruptcy filing (gate-keeping provision, very broad)
  * An entity that may be a debtor under a particular chapter (defined in §109) may commence a voluntary bankruptcy case… (loose requirement that you be a "debtor")
  * Note: must say what chapter you are filing (must designate exit at commencement). So, when you file for bankruptcy, you must file under a particular chapter

### §303 - Involuntary bankruptcy filing

* §303(a) - Involuntary bankruptcy case
  * Have to be a "person"
  * You can file an involuntary petition against any person who can be a debtor in ch. 7, 11, but CANNOT file an involuntary petition against a non-profit (Catholic Church diocese)
  * Note: Non-profit corporations is a very important carve out of 303(a). Corp that "is not a moneyed, business, or commercial corp" is considered non-profit
  
* **§303(b) - Basic criteria:**
  * **303(b)(1) - If more than 12 creditors in total, need at least 3 entities on the petition with aggregated unsecured obligations >$15,775**
    * Policy justification: If 3 major CRs can agree that bankruptcy is the right call, it will likely benefit all CRs
  * **303(b)(2) - If less than 12 creditors in total, only need 1 entity with aggregated unsecured obligations >$15,775**
    * Note: the use of the word "such" transfers over the other requirements from (1)
    * Note: the word "entity" is used instead of person. This is a deliberate move to include the possibility a government entity is one of the creditors
    * Note: in counting the number of total creditors, we are not going to count an employee or an insider
  * **303(b)(3) – If a partnership**
    * By fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership; or
    * if relief has been ordered under this title with respect to all of the general partners in such partnership, by a general partner in such partnership, the trustee of such a general partner, or a holder of a claim against such partnership;
  
* **303(c)**: Allows unsecured claim holders that are non-contingent to join to the 303(b) filers
  * Note: The addition provision allows for the possibility of adding on a disputed claim after the initial filing
  
* **303(h)**: Additional Requirement - Is debtor not paying its debts as they become due?
  * Involuntary debtor has 20 days to file a responsive pleading. Significantly,§303(h) provides that if the involuntary petition "is not timely controverted, the court shall order relief against the debtor". However, if contested, can only proceed with commencement if "the involuntary debtor is generally not paying debts as they become due unless subject to a bona fide dispute"
  * 303(h) thus becomes a defense the debtor has to a properly filed involuntary petition
  * Note: this is just a general requirement, would expect that the creditors filing are those that are not being paid on time, but the creditors filing do not necessarily need to be the ones who are not being paid on time
  
* **303(i)**: Damages for bad faith filings
  * Potential penalties are pretty serious, potentially allowing for punitive damages

### 28 U.S.C. §1408 – Venue Provision

* A Chapter 11 bankruptcy can be commenced in any jurisdiction of:
  * (1) DR's domicile, residence, principal place of business in the United States, or principal assets in the United States have been located for the 180 days preceding commencement;
    * "Domicile" = state of incorporation (typically Delaware)
  * (2) Which a Ch. 11 case concerning an affiliate, general partner, or partnership is pending
    * This makes it possible for companies to file anywhere because technically all they have to do is set up a shell corporation in the jurisdiction they wish to file in, and put the new "affiliate" in bankruptcy

## How and Where to Commence

* To commence, must file petition with clerk (See Fed. R. Bankr. P)
  * Most difficult part is listing all creditors, in a big case (e.g. Lehman Bros), court will allow you to defer the list of creditors
  * Prepackaged case: When bankruptcy and the reorganization plan is filed at the same time (Works best if DR has few creditors, and wants end case quickly)
  * No formal requirement to be insolvent; possible to file where assets are greater than liabilities
    * Insolvency can come in as a defense in involuntary filings, DR can contest that they are generally paying debts to defeat involuntary petition
    * Exception is Ch. 9 municipal BR filing (e.g. Puerto Rico)
  
* Large companies can essentially file for bankruptcy anywhere in the United States because the Bankruptcy Code's venue provision is incredibly broad
  * The laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because law in different circuits differs and because bankruptcy incorporates a lot of state law
  * Thus, broad venue provision allows DRs to file strategically in jurisdiction that may be more favorable to them
  
* Bases for establishing venue:
  * Domicile, residence
  * State of Incorporation basis
  * Headquarters basis
  * Place of primary assets
  * Affiliate basis
    * The affiliate files and company piggybacks on case (If a subsidiary is in the state, you can file there)
    * Ex. IGM has car dealership in Harlem, so it can file in NY even though it is a DE corporation with PPB in Detroit
  
* Despite broad venue provision, most companies try to file in either Federal District Court of DE or SDNY
  * Access to hearings on short notice, particularly first hearing of case, during which first day orders are proposed – requests to have/hire a bankruptcy lawyer; requests to continue paying EEs; requests to approves DR-in-possession financing; requests to pay off key suppliers/critical vendors
  * Petitions automatically referred to Bankruptcy Court
  * Why New York?
    * Companies want to file here because the judges are experienced and sophisticated, easy access to experienced lawyers, and because it is easier to get professional fees in New York (fees charged to estate at normal NY rate, regardless of DR's origin)
    * New York used to have a reputation for letting DRs keep control of the case for as long as they wanted to – e.g., extending period during which only DR can propose reorganization indefinitely beyond initial first four months of case)
  * Why Delaware?
    * Delaware used to be the most popular venue (in '90s) because Delaware judges were known for first-day orders that signed off on everything you needed for the entire case. Prior to '90s, NY was most popular location to file, but now there is a split between NY and DE
      * Today, mega-cases go to SDNY while big cases go to Delaware
    * Likely able to file here under venue provisions since majority of large companies are incorporated in DE

## Voluntary Filing

* Percentage of BR cases filed voluntarily is 97-98%
  * However, this is a bit misleading, bc many debtors are “pushed” into bankruptcy
  * Some voluntary cases are really involuntary; Creditors pursues debtor, debtor files case before they do – if debtor files, has more control over case (e.g. choose where to file, which exit chapter to use)
* When you file, you must declare the Chapter you are filing under, thus exit is designated at the time of commencement
  
* Why don’t secured creditors want Chapter 11 Bankruptcy?
  * Creditors want their collateral as soon as possible, sell it and move on
  * In Chapter 11, there is no Trustee, so the debtor tries to reorganize and creditors don’t get their collateral quickly
  * So creditors want Chapter 7, bc there would be a Trustee to sell the assets and secured interest, so that creditors would get their collateral quickly
  * Secured creditors suspect that in Bankruptcy, they will not get every cent they are entitled to: interest rate
    * If under-collateralized --> get no interest at all
    * If over-collateralized --> if they do get interest rate…worried it might be less than a genuine appropriate interest rate. SCOTUS has provided for a mandatory interest rate, which is widely viewed as under-compensatory

### In re Treasure Island Trust

* Facts: Treasure Island Land Trust files for Ch. 11 bankruptcy. Creditors protest filing, arguing that Land Trust does not qualify as a proper debtor under §109
* Issue 1: Is Treasure Island a business trust?
  * Test: Does this trust have characteristics of a business trust? A business trust is created for carrying on business (similar to a corporation). A non-business trust is created to protect/preserve the trust
  * Held: No. The terminology of the trust instrument suggests it is a non-business trust, and is not similar to a corporation. In fact, it explicitly states the intention not to be transacting business of any kind. There is no evidence of any business activity in the trust to that end
* Issue 2: Whether a simple land trust could otherwise be a "person" under Ch. 11?
  * Held: No. Congress did not intend to expand the category of debtors eligible for relief
    * §301 in conjunction with §109(a) is clear that only a "person" may be a debtor and thus eligible for BR. Additionally §101(3) defines person as either an individual, partnership, or corporation (i.e. business trust). **In not performing any business functions and legally identifying as a non-business entity in the past in order to avoid regulations, there is no reasonable grounds on which TI could be identified as a business trust**
      * Ironically, the prior legal proceedings against the SEC in which TI argued it was not a business trust, but it failed here. However, the fact that it attempted to characterize itself as a non-business trust in the prior case (though unsuccessful) caused them to lose here as well
    * Other possible reasons to deny TI's petition
      * Ch. 11 is concerned with reorganizing business - there is nothing to reorganize here
      * Only 2 creditors, both of which are secured. Minimal risk of dismemberment or coordination problems in the absence of BR
  * Policy: There are policy reasons for excluding land trusts and the like from bankruptcy – these are really just two party disputes (the DR and its lenders) and bankruptcy is typically appropriate only when there is a potential collective action problem (lots of unsecured creditors). Ch. 11 bankruptcy is appropriate if there is some value outside of bankruptcy and there are leftovers for unsecured creditors
  
* Thought Question: Is the court right? Is this a problem that bankruptcy is intended to fix?
  * Ultimately, while the land trust may have a coordination problem, it is with equity holders rather than creditors and thus is really a two-party dispute not generally within the purview of bankruptcy
  
* Hypo: What if TI turned into a corporation and then filed for bankruptcy?
  * Argument that it is a valid filing:  TI is now a corporation and as a strict statutory matter/matter of the code it should be eligible for bankruptcy
    * Transferring assets to corporation isn't fraudulent since mortgages follow with it and CR's are still protected
    * Nothing in Ch. 11 to forbid it from filing, but Courts can look at substance over form and kick it out
  * Argument that this is not a valid filing: This is a sham!
    * §1112(b): If there is cause, a case can be converted to another type of bankruptcy or dismissed (see analysis in Kingston Square)
    * §305: Courts can abstain from a case if interests would be better served by dismissing the case
    * §105: catch-all for all things Bankruptcy court doesn’t have clear authority to do
  * Courts tend to lean towards letting cases stand

### LTV Steel

* Facts
  * LTV Steel (parent corporation) sets up a few subsidiaries: Sales Finance and Steel Products
  * Each subsidiary enters into loan:
    * Sales Finance enters loan with Abby National (secured in accounts receivable – IOUs in the sale of steel products LTV is making)
    * Steel enters with Chase (security in inventory)
  * LTV files for Chapter 11, though subsidiaries do not follow it into bankruptcy
    * LTV seeks to use cash collateral (consisting of accounts receivable and inventory) from secured creditors Abbey National and Chase Bank
* Issue: Can the debtor use the cash collateral in the midst of bankruptcy?
* CR Argument: The cash collateral is not part of the debtor's bankruptcy estate because the loans were made through the subsidiaries, Sales Finance and Steel Products. This form of securitization involves setting up separate transactions that build a wall and keep the transactions outside bankruptcy
  * Creditor's want cash collateral outside the estate so it is not subject to automatic stay and they can foreclose directly instead of going thru bankruptcy
* Holding: Cash collateral is part of the estate (bankruptcy court not convinced it was a "true sale"); **Debtor can use cash collateral**
  * Court claimed this was in the best interest of the estate and all creditors of the estate
  * The fact that the loans are secured by the inventory suggest that it was not really a "true sale" because inventory is not really something you can sell (**cannot release interest in inventory**) (because LTV's labor and production capital was used to produce the inventory)
* This case was bombshell: first to call securitization into question; Bankruptcy courts will not just take these at face value
  * Can't use some arrangement that merely resembles a securitization and expect to receive the same benefits of remoteness from bankruptcy
  * Here, a securitization in inventory was going too far. Was not a true securtization transaction

## Involuntary Filing

* Occurs very infrequently; Only 2-3% are BR cases are filed involuntarily
  * Why? No guarantee that costs incurred by CR's in commencing will be recovered. Involuntary BR is also a public good that benefits all CRs, so better chance of full recovery if those CRs sue instead of commence BR
  
* Justification for filing involuntary petition
  * Creditor can then pick the bankruptcy courts that he/she wants
  * If creditors worry about not getting paid in full outside of bankruptcy
  * If there’s a fear that there’s fraud happening in debtor corporation
  * If creditor is worried that debtor has been paying back others creditors (making preferential payments), so you file in order to get the same treatment
  
* Must first determine if criteria are met
  * Is the appropriate amount of claim holders filing the petition met?
    * If 12 or more CR's, then 3. If less than 12, only 1
    * Partnerships have different rules - See §303(b)(3)
  * Is the aggregate amount of exposure met? (>$15,775)
    * Exposure: unsecured obligations
      * A fully secured creditor can count towards number of necessary claim holders, but secured obligations aren’t added to the sum
        * Why? Secured creditors are going to be compensated regardless and thus the involuntary petition was specifically designed to protect the interests of unsecured creditors
        * Exception: If a secured CR is undersecured, the amount by which it is undersecured contributes towards aggregate amount requirement
      * Claims cannot be disputed/contingent. Only non-contingent undisputed claims count towards the exposure threshold (Courts often allow CRs to petition if only part of the claim is disputed)
        * Contingent: debt/obligation that may or may not become due
          * Classic example: guarantee (unsure whether this obligation will be called on, claim doesn't come into existence unless debtor fails to pay)
          * Ex: if Bernie Sanders wins, I owe you $10k
        * Disputed: debt/obligation there is a fight about what the claim is
          * Ex: tort action
* Once debtor is thrown into bankruptcy, what can debtor do to get out of it?
  1. Challenge §303(b) – maybe one or more claim is disputed; maybe there aren’t 3 creditors; maybe amount requirement is not met
  1. §303(h) – debtor can show that he/she is paying his debts as they come due
     * The easiest way for a debtor to defeat an involuntary petition is to show that he is solvent (can pay debts) and that he is currently/is willing to pay his debts on time
     * There can be disputes about what "pay as debts come due" means
     * Example: If debtor is paying all the little creditors, but not the 1 big creditor, then is debtor paying debts as they come due?

### *In re Kingston Square*

* Parties in this case:
  * Ginsberg: owner of the real estate partnerships (limited partnerships)
  * Chase/REFG: Commercial banks (made the original loans to limited partnerships. Give loan, get mortgage on each property back)
  * DLJ: Investment bank (orchestrate the purchase of the mortgages after the bank has made the loan, sets up Special Purpose Vehicle, sets up the mortgage securitization). Does everything but makes the initial loan, including servicing the bank loans, foreclosing on the properties (enforcer), setting up the board of directors, setting up SPV/dealing with investors
  
* Facts: Mortgages made were cross-default (if default on one, then defaults on the other). Mortgages packaged up and sold to SPV that was setup by DLG. A "bankruptcy remote" provision was included in the LP's charter as part of the mortgage loans, making voluntary BR filing require unanimous board approval. Independent director appointed by DLJ. Thus, DLJ (CR) able to prevent the LPs from filing bankruptcy by having appointed director vote no. Ginsberg circumvents the agreement by orchestrating involuntary bankruptcy from unsecured creditors
* Movant's argument: Rounding up creditor's to circumvent provision was bad faith on behalf of Ginsburg DLJ seek dismissal under § 1112(b) to throw out the petition for collusion in filing
  * DLJ doesn't want BR because it has more control outside of BR
* Holding: although it may look like bad-faith filing, **the court allows the filing to stand**
  * Bankruptcy is actually in the best interest of the creditors (1112(b) gives court the total discretion of whether to kick the case out)
    * Would preserve value for estate and CR's
    * Court's also not sympathetic to provisions in agreements effectively waiving rights to BR
  * Since there does seem to be equity in these properties, bankruptcy seems worthwhile
* Blackletter: **You cannot generally waive your right to file for bankruptcy as an individual or a corporation. Courts are very skeptical of waiving bankruptcy filing rights**

### Hypotheticals

* HYPO #1:
  * Setup: Debtor is a small family business. Corporation is in a little financial trouble. Corporation has 10 creditors in total. Two of the creditors file an involuntary petition
    * Creditor A: owed 10k (not secured)
    * Creditor B: owed 14k (partially secured, 5k)
  * Is involuntary bankruptcy an option here?
    * YES, assuming the debtor is not paying his debts as they become due and none of the claims are contingent/disputed, the exposure is 19k
    * Reason: this is because the corporation is not a non-profit. When there are fewer that 12 creditors in total, only one entity must file. The exposure amount/unsecured obligations (19k) is above the required aggregate amount
* HYPO #2
  * Setup Debtor is a small family business. Corporation is in a little financial trouble. Corporation has over 12 creditors in total. Three of the creditors file an involuntary petition
    * Creditor A: owed 10k (not secured)
    * Creditor B: owed 14k (partially secured, 5k)
    * Creditor C: owed 20k (27k secured)
  * Is involuntary bankruptcy an option here?
    * YES. When a debtor has over 12 creditors, 3 entities whose claims aggregate to meet the exposure amount are needed to file. Even though creditor C adds nothing to the exposure amount because his claim is fully secured, he is still allowed to count as one of the three necessary entities
