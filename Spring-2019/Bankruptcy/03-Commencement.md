## Key Provisions

### §109 – Who Qualifies as a Debtor

* §109(a) - General provision for who qualifies as a “debtor”
  * “Only a person that resides in the United States, or has a domicile, a place of business, or a property in the United States, or a municipality, may be a debtor under this title
* §109(b) - Who can file as a debtor under chapter 7
  * Who qualifies for 7 (and therefore for 11)?
    * A “Person” (defined in §101(41)) includes individuals, partnerships, or corporations
    * A “Corporation”(defined in §101(9))…includes business trust
    * Exclusions in chapter 7:
      * Provision is designed to exclude commercial banks and insurance companies from bankruptcy entirely
        * Why? Bc they have their own system of regulation; have possession of other people’s money
* §109(c) - Who can file as a debtor under chapter 9?
* §109(d) - Who can file as a debtor under chapter 11?
  * Only a railroad, a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title (except a stockbroker or a commodity broker)
  * You have to be able file for chapter 7 to file for chapter 11
  * Carve out for Railroads: railroads can only go into Chapter 11 (not 7). Why? Historical logic is that we shouldn’t be liquidating railroads/shutting them down
  * Exception for stockbrokers/commodity broker: stockbrokers/commodity brokers (i.e. an investment banks) are not allowed to reorganize, but can liquidate (can file for Ch. 7, but not 11). Why? Logic is that investment banks have other people’s money and it might be tough to sort out who gets what/customer money might get lost. Note that investment banks can put subsidiaries/holding companies in chapter 11

### §301 - Voluntary Bankruptcy Filing

* §301 – Voluntary bankruptcy filing (gate-keeping provision, very broad)
  * An entity that may be a debtor under a particular chapter (defined in §109) may commence a voluntary bankruptcy case… (loose requirement that you be a “debtor”)
  * Note: must say what chapter you are filing (must designate exit at commencement). So, when you file for bankruptcy, you must file under a particular chapter

### §303 - Involuntary bankruptcy filing

* §303(a) - Involuntary bankruptcy case
  * Have to be a “person”
  * You can file an involuntary petition against any person who can be a debtor in ch. 7, 11, but CANNOT file an involuntary petition against a non-profit (Catholic Church deices)
  * Note: Non-profit corporations is a very important carve out of 303(a)
* §303(b) - Basic criteria:
  * Is the appropriate amount of claimholders filing the petition?
    * 303(b)(1) - If more than 12 creditors in total, need at least 3 entities to file
    * 303(b)(2) - If less than 12 creditors in total, only need 1 entity
      * Note: the use of the word “such” transfers over the other requirements from (1)
      * Note: the word “entity” is used instead of person. This is a deliberate move to include the possibility a government entity is one of the creditors
      * Note: in counting the number of total creditors, we are not going to count an employee or an insider
    * 303(b)(3) – If a partnership, need to be filed by general partners
      * Is the aggregate amount of exposure met? (>$15,775)
        	Exposure: unsecured obligations
        	Note: a fully secured creditor can count as one of the necessary claimholders so long as the exposure amount is otherwise met (the fully secured creditor ads $0 to the aggregate amount)
          * Why? Secured creditors are going to be compensated regardless and thus the involuntary petition was specifically designed to protect the interests of unsecured creditors
o	Are any of the claims used to meet the aggregate amount contingent or disputed? 
	Note: only claims that are not contingent and not disputed can be factored into this amount 
	Contingent: debt/obligation that may or may not become due 
•	Classic example: guarantee (unsure whether this obligation will be called on, claim doesn’t come into existence unless debtor fails to pay) 
•	Ex: if Bernie Sanders wins, I owe you $10k 
	Disputed: debt/obligation there is a fight about what the claim is
•	Ex: tort action 
o	Additional Requirement (found in 303(h)): Is there a material breach (debtor not paying its debts as they become due)? 
	303(h) is a defense the debtor has to a properly filed involuntary petition  
	Note: this is just a general requirement, would expect that the creditors filing are those that are not being paid on time, but the creditors filing do not necessarily need to be the ones who are not being paid on time 
	The easiest way for a debtor to defeat an involuntary petition is to show that he is solvent (can pay debts) and that he is currently/is willing to pay his debts on time 
•	303(c): allows unsecured claim holders that are non-contingent to join to the 303(b) filers
o	Note: the addition provision allows for the possibility of adding on a disputed claim after the initial filing   
•	303(i): Damages for bad faith filings. Potential penalties are pretty serious, potentially allowing for punitive damages  
28 U.S.C. §1408 –Venue Provision 
•	Broadly worded
•	Basis for establishing venue: 
o	Domicile, residence 
o	State of Incorporation basis
o	Headquarters basis
o	Place of primary assets
o	Affiliate basis**. The affiliate files and company piggybacks on case. (If a subsidiary is in the state, you can file there.)
	Ex. IGM has car dealership in Harlem, so it can file in NY even though it is a DE corporation with PPB in Detroit. 
B.	Voluntary Filing – Treasure Island
•	Facts: Treasure Island Land Trust files for Ch. 11 bankruptcy. Creditors protest filing, arguing that Land Trust does not qualify as a proper debtor under §109. 
•	Issue: Does this land trust qualify as a “debtor” under Chapter 11? 
o	Eventually, question becomes does this particular trust have the characteristics of a business trust, which would enable it to file under Ch. 11? 
•	Holding: the land trust was NOT a business trust. Thus, it is NOT entitled to be a debtor under Ch. 11
•	To come to this result, the bankruptcy court looked at the trust instrument (doc creating the trust) and saw that it specifically states it is not a business trust and it intends not to be transacting business of any kind. This was more persuasive evidence than the SEC claiming it was a corporation for securities law
•	Thought Question: Is the court right? Is this a problem that bankruptcy is intended to fix? 
o	Ultimately, while the land trust may have a coordination problem, it is with equity holders rather than creditors and thus is really a two-party dispute not generally within the purview of bankruptcy. 
C.	Voluntary Filing – LTV Steel
•	Facts: LTV Steel (parent corporation) files for Ch. 11 bankruptcy and seeks to use cash collateral (consisting of accounts receivable and inventory) from secured creditors Abbey National and Chase Bank. The loans creditors made went through two subsidiaries set up by LTV (Sales Finance and Steel Products) 
•	Issue: can the debtor use the cash collateral in the midst of bankruptcy? 
o	Creditor’s arg: the cash collateral is not part of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate bc the loans were made through the subsidiaries, Sales Finance and Steel Products. This form of securitization involves setting up separate transactions that build a wall and keep the transactions outside bankruptcy.
o	Creditor’s want cash collateral outside the estate so it is not subject to automatic stay and they can foreclose directly instead of going thru bankruptcy
•	Holding: cash collateral is part of the estate (bankruptcy court not convinced it was a “true sale”); Debtor can use cash collateral. Claimed in best interest of the estate/all creditors of the estate.
o	The fact that the loans are secured by the inventory suggest that it was not really a “true sale” because inventory is not really something you can sell (cannot release interest in inventory) (because LTV’s labor was used to produce the inventory) 


D.	Involuntary Filing -- Kingston Square  
•	Parties in this case: 
o	Ginsberg: owner of the real estate partnerships (limited partnerships)
o	Chase/REFG: Commercial banks (made the original loans to limited partnerships. Give loan, get mortgage on each property back) 
o	DLJ: Investment bank (orchestrate the purchase of the mortgages after the bank has made the loan, sets up Special Purpose Vehicle, sets up the mortgage securitization). Does everything but makes the initial loan, including servicing the bank loans, foreclosing on the properties (enforcer), setting up the board of directors, setting up SPV/dealing with investors 
•	Facts: Creditors tried to prevent the LPs from filing bankruptcy by placing a provision that a unanimous board vote is required (DLJ is on the board, so it would vote no). Ginsberg circumvents the agreement by orchestrating involuntary bankruptcy from unsecured creditors. Movants seek dismissal under § 1112(b) to throw out the petition for collusion in filing. 
•	Holding: although it may look like bad-faith filing, the court allows the filing to stand 
o	Bankruptcy is actually in the best interest of the creditors (1112(b) gives court the total discretion of whether to kick the case out)
o	Since there does seem to be equity in these properties, bankruptcy seems worthwhile
•	BLL: you cannot generally waive your right to file for bankruptcy as an individual or a corporation. Courts are very skeptical of waiving bankruptcy filing rights

E.	Involuntary Bankruptcy HYPOS

HYPO #1: Debtor is a small family business. Corporation is in a little financial trouble. Corporation has 10 creditors in total. Two of the creditors file an involuntary petition 
•	Creditor A: owed 10k (not secured) 
•	Creditor B: owed 14k (partially secured, 5k) 

Is involuntary bankruptcy an option here? 
•	YES, assuming the debtor is not paying his debts as they become due and none of the claims are contingent/disputed, the exposure is 19k. 
•	Reason: this is because the corporation is not a non-profit. When there are fewer that 12 creditors in total, only one entity must file. The exposure amount/unsecured obligations (19k) is above the required 15,325.

HYPO #2: Debtor is a small family business. Corporation is in a little financial trouble. Corporation has over 12 creditors in total. Three of the creditors file an involuntary petition 
•	Creditor A: owed 10k (not secured) 
•	Creditor B: owed 14k (partially secured, 5k) 
•	Creditor C: owed 20k (27k secured) 

Is involuntary bankruptcy an option here? 
•	YES. When a debtor has over 12 creditors, 3 entities whose claims aggregate to meet the exposure amount are needed to file. Even though creditor C adds nothing to the exposure amount because his claim is fully secured, he is still allowed to count as one of the three necessary entities
