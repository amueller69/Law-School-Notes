# Trustee’s Avoidance Powers – Preferences

* Context: part of (2) property of the estate section
  * Expands the estate by bringing transferred property back into the estate to be distributed among creditors equally and according to the priority scheme
  * Since an insolvent debtor cannot pay all unsecured creditors in full, transfer of debtor’s property to pay or secure obligations of some creditors gives them preference

* Voidable Preferences
  * Governed by §547
  * Avoid/reverse transfers that are made “on the eve of bankruptcy” (defined as within 90 days of bankruptcy, extended to 1 year if the transferee is an insider)
  * Allows trustee to avoid transfers from the debtor’s ESTATE only
  * Justification for preference law
    1. Equality of creditors (similarly situated creditors should be treated equally)
    2. Discourages a race to the courthouse (important to bankruptcy’s collective process)
       * Like the automatic stay, which is THE most important provision for ensuring collective process

## Key Provisions

### §507

* Order of Preferences
  * (1) Secured creditors
  * (2) Unsecured –priority creditors
  * (3) Unsecured without priority creditors (pro-rata distribution)
  * (4) Exceptions found in §726

### §550

* Tells trustee what he can get and who he can get it from (works with §547)
* §550(a)(1) – the trustee can recover a transfer from …
  * (1) The initial transferee of such a transfer (whomever received the preferential transfer) OR
  * (2) The entity for whose benefit the transfer was made
* §550(c)—if the transfer is made for the benefit of a CR who at the time of the transfer was an insider and the transfer was made outside the 90 day period, the trustee can ONLY recover from the insider

### §547 – Preferences

* §547(b) – requirements for a voidable preference
  * Trustee can avoid transfers from the DR’s estate only
  * Preference Test (see further explanation below!)
  * Pre-Requirement: there must be a transfer made (usually the payment of money, but really any giving of value)...
    1. To/for the benefit of the creditor
    2. For an antecedent debt
    3. The debtor must be insolvent at the time of the transfer
       * Worried about eve of bankruptcy transfers to an insolvent debtor
    4. The transfer must have occurred within 90 days of filing
       * Note: within one year of filing for an “insider”
    5. Must satisfy the “more than” test
       * Must give creditor more than he would receive in a chapter 7 liquidation
       * Note: almost always satisfied when the creditor is under-collateralized. NOT satisfied when creditor is fully secured or when debtor is solvent during the bankruptcy case
  * Note: unlike the old Bankruptcy Act (which required creditors whose preference was avoided to have received notice of its advantage over other creditors), now there is no such reasonable-cause-to-believe requirement

* §547(e) - Time of transfer for a security interest
  * A security interest that is perfected within 30 days (filed within 30 days), then the date of creation is the relevant date for determining when the security interest “transferred” for purposes of determining if it is a preferential transfer.
  * Yet, if fail to file within 30 days of creation, the date of perfection is when the security interest is deemed to have “transferred”
  * Note: can file before security interest agreement. BUT, there is no transfer until the agreement or until the debtor has obtained rights in the collateral. Always remember all components of VAR must be satisfied
    * Value: creditor either made a loan or committed to make a loan
    * Agreement: parties must have signed an agreement (normally a security agreement)
    * Rights: debtor must have rights in the collateral. Cannot have rights in property you do not own yet
  * Skeel: If you file within 30 days, important date is date of creation. Otherwise important date is date of perfection

* §547(f) – Presumption of debtor’s insolvency
  * Presumption that debtor was insolvent during 90 days immediately before filing
  * Creditor (receiving transfer) has burden of proof to rebut this presumption
  * Note: no presumption of insolvency when dealing with an insider preference, so trustee must prove insolvency

* §547(c) — Safe harbors (where creditors are not actually being preferred)**
  * §547(c)(1) -- Contemporaneous exchange safe harbor
    * Only available when parties intended for the value to transfer at the same time
  * §547(c)(2)-- Ordinary course of business safe harbor
    * When debtor (1) incurs obligation in the ordinary course of business and (2) payments are made either (a) in the ordinary course of business or (b) according to ordinary business terms
    * Note: ordinary business terms must be common to both parties
    * Note: (c)(2) applies even when involving payments on a long-term debt
  * §547(c)(3)-- PMSI protection safe harbor
    * As long as perfection is done within 30 days of DR obtaining the collateral that secures the loan, it is NOT a preferential transfer
  * §547(c)(4)-- Future Advances safe harbor (payment, then extension of credit)
    * Provides protection when CR receives payments from DR within the window, but then extends new credit to DR afterwards
    * Takes away the safe harbor to the extent that the CR is not actually exposed. Protection only covers the amount to which the CR is exposed
    * §547(c)(4)(a)—takes away this safe harbor when CR’s future extension of credit is secured
    * §547(c)(4)(b)—takes away this safe harbor when CR’s future extension of credit could be protected by another safe harbor provision
  * §547(c)(5) -- Two Point Net Improvement Test (inventory and accounts receivable)
    * Only a preference to the extent that CR is less under-collateralized at BR than it was at the time of the transfer. Only deemed a preference if it prejudices other creditors (NOT if oil is the collateral and there is a change in oil prices)
    * Pre-Step: determine whether we are dealing with collateral that involves inventory or accounts receivable
    * Step 1: Determine how under-collateralized CR is 90 days before bankruptcy OR at the time of the loan if made after 90 days (aka closer to bankruptcy filing than 90 days)
      * Note: if 90 days before bankruptcy, the CR was fully secured. Then there is NO preference.
    * Step 2: Determine how under-collateralized CR is at the time of Bankruptcy
    * Step 3: If the value in (2) is LESS than the value in (1) … the CR is less under-collateralized at the time of BR (i.e. in a better position) and there IS a preference
    * Step 4: Determine the value of the preference by subtracting (1) – (2).
  * §547(c)(7) --Domestic Support Obligations safe harbor
    * Spouses, children, and government units providing assistance do NOT have to give back alimony/child support payments received within preference period
  * §547(c)(8) + (9) --Small amounts safe harbor
    * §547(c)(8) – payments made on debts that are “primarily consumer debts” less than $600 cannot be recovered as preferential transfers
    * §547(c)(9) – payments made on debts that are “not primarily consumer debts” less than $5,000 (up to $6,225 now) cannot be recovered as preferential transfers

## Voidable Preference Test - §547(b)

* Pre-requirement: that there was a transfer made from the debtor’s estate
  * **Transfer - §101(54)**
    * Broad definition, basically anything involving transfer of value, which includes….
      * Transfer of money, transfer of a security interest, transfer of lien**
      * Creation of a lien
      * Retention of title as a security interest
      * Foreclosure of debtor’s equity of redemption
      * Each mode of dispensing/parting with property OR an interest in property
      * Note: also includes lien on property and judicial liens
    * Note: it is important to figure out WHEN the transfer actually occurred (can be difficult if dealing with a security interest—refer to §547(e))
* (1) The transfer must be made to /for the benefit of the creditor
  * Skeel: seems like a trivial requirement, but is actually really more important, especially when dealing with three-party transactions (see below HYPO with preferential transfer to Bank from DR for the benefit of insider/guarantor of bank loan!)
* (2) The transfer must be made for an antecedent debt
  * Debt must have occurred before payment (i.e. there must be some gap between the debt and the payment/transfer). Theoretically any gap is enough but be reasonable
  * Note: antecedent requirement NOT met when there is a contemporaneous transaction  (where the debtor pays and gets something at the same time) or payment in advance
  * Skeel: “mechanical” timeframe requirement (unlike contemporaneous exchange safe harbor)
  * HYPO:
    * Epstein   Staples.
    * If E pays first, then S delivers goods month later, S files for bankruptcy.  The delivery of the supplies was on behalf of an antecedent debt. Would figure out the value of the supplies, which would be the value of the transfer and then E would have an unsecured claim for that value assuming there was no security interest
    * If E pays first, then S delivers goods month later, E files for bankruptcy. The payment was NOT on account of an antecedent debt (payment in advance).
*  (3) The debtor must be insolvent at the time of transfer
  * Insolvent: the value of debts/liabilities > the value of assets
  * §547(f) creates a presumption of insolvency during the 90 days pre-filing. DR could rebut the presumption and show assets > liabilities at the time of the transfer
  * Note: if trying to go after DR for a transfer to an insider (within one year), there is NO presumption and the trustee will have to prove DR insolvency beyond the 90 days
* (4) Transfer occurred within 90 days of filing OR 1 year of filing if made to an insider
  * “Insider” (§101(31)) – broadly defined, includes affiliates, officers, directors, persons in control
* (5) Satisfies “more than” test
  * Determines whether CR would be better off getting transfer than Ch. 7 liquidation
  * Exceptions (when fails “more than” test):
    1. If CR is fully secured – fails more than test because he will get 100% of his claim paid in bankruptcy anyway
    2. If DR is solvent – DR will be able to pay all unsecured claims in full anyway. Here, we are talking about insolvency at the time of filing/during the bankruptcy case, not necessarily at the time of the transfer.
  * Skeel: an under-secured creditor will always satisfy the more than test
  * Note: more than test only looks at what the CR would recover from the DR’s estate in bankruptcy (does NOT consider any third party payments, like the possibility of turning to a guarantor/letter of credit lender in the event of bankruptcy filing) [in re Powerine Oil Co]

### In re Powerine Oil Co

* Facts: Koch sells oil to DR (Powerine). There is a LOC from bank that lists Koch as beneficiary. DR pays for oil and then soon after files for bankruptcy
* Trustee tries to reclaim the payment as a preferential transfer
* Holding: YES preferential transfer. Must be returned
* Meets “more than test” which only looks at what CR would receive from DR’s estate (does not consider third party payments)
* Note: argument that Koch is actually worse off not better off from this payment because otherwise could turn to the Bank for payment in full in the event DR defaults and files for bankruptcy
* Note: unlike the old Bankruptcy Act (which required creditors whose preference was avoided to have received notice of its advantage over other creditors), now there is no such reasonable-cause-to-believe requirement

### What Counts As A Preferential Transfer

* Is the attaching of a security interest a preferential transfer?
  * Prima facie voidable preference IF other §547(b) elements are satisfied because attaching of a security interest is a transfer of property of debtor on account of antecedent loan debt
* Are Letters of Credit preferential transfers?
  * NO! The security interest does not secure an antecedent debt
  * The transfer of property is contemporaneous exchange for new value (the value being the bank’s issuance of the letter of credit)
  * Note: this analysis depends on when letter of credit was originally sought

### Preferential Transfer Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical 1:
  * Setup:
    * 1/1: Bank loan (100k). Security interest in property (worth 125k).
    * 3/1: 10k payment (now Bank owed 90k)
    * 7/1: 50k payment (now Bank owed 40k)
    * 8/1: Bankruptcy (Bank owed 40k still, after the 60k payments leading up to the filing)
  * Can trustee avoid the 7/1 50k payment? NO!!
    * Over-collateralized creditor. More than test fails although the other requirements are satisfied for a preferential transfer. Fully secured creditor would get the same thing either way (inside and outside bankruptcy).
  * Modification: Assume that the collateral is worth $75k (less than Bank’s 100k claim) in which case Bank is an under-secured creditor.
  * Can the trustee avoid the 7/1 50k payment? YES
    * At the time of the 7/1 transfer, the Bank was an under-collateralized creditor at the time of the transfer (had a 90k claim and a 75k security interest in collateral)
    * Skeel: if you are an under-collateralized creditor, the more than test will always be met
  * Can trustee avoid the 3/1 payment? NO!
    * This payment was made outside of the 90 day (reverse) window. Would not be a preferential transfer unless it is to an insider.
    * Note: if the 3/1 payment (outside of the 90 days) was large enough to make the Bank a fully secured or even over-collateralized creditor, then the 7/1 transfer would no longer be a preferential transfer and so would not have to give it back to the estate

* Hypothetical 2:
  * Setup
    * 1/1: loan, security interest
    * 1/15: files [perfects security interest]
    * 2/15: DR files for bankruptcy
  * Is this a preferential transfer?
    * Is there a transfer (exchange of value)? Yes. CR provides loan; DR provides security interest
    * When did the “transfer” of security interest occur? Did it cover an antecedent debt?
      * Possibilities: (1) date of creation (1/1); (2) date of perfection (1/15)
      * If date of creation, this would NOT be a preferential transfer because the security interest DR provided would not be covering an antecedent debt (would instead be contemporaneous exchange of value)
      * If date of perfection, this would be a preferential transfer because it would be securing an antecedent debt
      * Answer: the creation date (1/1). This is because perfection was completed within 30 days of the agreement.
      * Rule: §547(e) – if you perfect security interest within 30 days, the time of creation is the relevant date to determine when the security interest “transferred.” If you fail to perfect security interest within 30 days, the time of perfection is the relevant date for determining the time of “transfer.” Must remember that you can file before the transaction (before 1/1), but the creation date would still be the relevant date because that would also be the perfection date

## Safe Harbors

### Contemporaneous Exchange Safe Harbor - §547(c)(1)
  
* Rule: when an exchange is essentially contemporaneous (occurring at the same time or with only a short gap), transfer will NOT be treated as a preference
* Question: what happens if there is a delay between payment and obtaining a security interest/perfecting a security interest?
  * Potential that creditor who gave value at the time security interest was created (contemporaneously), but did not perfect until later would be seen as having a lien for an antecedent debt. If this were the case, contemporaneous exchange exception would NOT apply
  * Note: creditor who fails to perfect within 30 days are unlikely to be able to turn to §547(c)(1) exception
* Note: **Only get the contemporaneous exchange safe harbor if the parties intended for the value to transfer at the same time**
  * Example:
  * If the parties intended to have a security interest backing up a loan on the date they entered into the agreement  could be a contemporaneous exchange
  * If the parties did NOT intend for there to be a security interest when they entered into agreement, but then later the CR decided it wanted or needed a security interest  contemporaneous exchange safe harbor does not necessarily cover it
* Example 1: Skeel goes to Staples to get supplies. Goes to register and forgot his wallet. Kept goods but ran out to his car to get wallet and then pays. This is simultaneous transfer most likely
* Example 2: Skeel goes to the store and asks can he pay them back tomorrow. Paying them back tomorrow would still most likely be seen as contemporaneous exchange transaction
* Hypothetical based on the following:
  * 1/1: 100k loan [when the CR gives value –V]
  * 1/3: Parties sign a security agreement (grant security interest in equipment) [when the parties enter into agreement –A]
  * 1/15: files (perfecting security interest)
  * 2/1: File for bankruptcy
  * Is this a preferential transfer under §547(b)? Does §547(c)(1)—contemporaneous exchange safe harbor cover this?
    * Was there a transfer? Yes. Exchange of value = security interest.
    * When did security interest transfer? 1/3. Since the security interest was perfected within 30 days of the agreement, the date of the “transfer” of the security interest is the creation date, here 1/3.
    * Was it securing an antecedent debt? Yes. This is because the loan was made on 1/1 and the agreement in which the DR agreed to give a security interest was 1/3.
    * Do any safe harbors save this seemingly preferential transfer? §547(c)(1) – contemporaneous exchange
      * Could argue that 2 days is thinkable for a contemporaneous exchange. The fact that it was just 2 days weighs in favor of it being a contemporaneous exchange, but if there is other evidence (sudden financial trouble for example), this might tip against it being a contemporaneous exchange
      * Note: only get the contemporaneous exchange safe harbor if the parties intended for the value to transfer at the same time.
      * If the parties on 1/1 intended to have a security interest backing up this loan  could be a contemporaneous exchange
      * If the parties did not intend for there to be a security interest on 1/1, but then later (on 1/3) the CR decided it wanted or needed a security interest  contemporaneous exchange safe harbor does not necessarily cover it

### Ordinary Course of Business Payments Safe Harbor - §547(c)(2)

* Rule: a trustee may not avoid a transfer to the extent that such transfer was in payment of a debt incurred by DR in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of DR and transferee
* Requirements:
  1. The obligation was incurred in the ordinary course of business
  2. The payment/transfers were made in ordinary course of business OR made according to ordinary business terms
      * “Ordinary Business Terms”= must meet business standards common to all parties (must be ordinary from both the perspective of the CR and DR)
* Examples: credit card payments; electric bills; long term loans are ocob (as per Wolas)
* Skeel: safe harbor most commonly invoked

* *Union Bank v. Wolas* – Ordinary course of business
  * Facts: debtor borrowed 7M from Bank. Filed for bankruptcy. During 90 days before filing, DR made two interest payments (100k total) + loan commitment payment/fee (2,500)
  * Issue: can payments on long-term debt qualify under §547(c)(2)—ordinary course of business exception?
  * Holding: payments on long-term debt, as well as payments on short-term debt, may qualify for the ordinary course of business exception
  * Meaning of “ordinary course of business” left open

* *In re National Gas Distributors* – Ordinary business terms
  * Facts: DR paid revolving line of credit and working capital loan to CR prior to filing for Ch11. DR made payments to free up collateral property pre-filing.
  * Trustee contends obligation was incurred in ordinary course of business. BUT payment NOT made according to “ordinary business terms”
  * Rule: “ordinary business terms” defense must consider standards of BOTH debtor and creditor
    * Here, DR and CR were in different industries. CR= commercial lender; DR= distributor of natural gas
  * Holding: transaction was ordinary from CR’s perspective (banking standards), but not from DR’s perspective.
  * Since DR looked to be engaging in pre-bankruptcy planning and thus trustee can avoid and recover these payments

* Problem (p. 293): restructuring of a loan. Debtor borrowed 400k from Bank on an unsecured basis. It had an interest payable monthly and had a maturity date of 90 days. DR suffered bad financial reversal during previous 90 days. Bank renegotiated the loan. DR paid monthly interest of about 11,500 and repaid 450,000 of the principal after which point the Bank renewed the loan for its unpaid principal amount of 500k but interest rate increased substantially.

* Are the 450k payment made when the loan was re-negotiated (3 months before filing) and 11,500 interest payment retrievable as preferences?
  * Looks like a preferential transfer. Meet the §547(b) requirements.
  * Only safe harbor argument is §547(c)(2) –ordinary course of business. Creditor will say it is ordinary course of business payment, argue this is what happens in these types of situations, say it is an ordinary event in the life of the loan. Response from the trustee is that it is not normal action (like Wolas).
  * Skeel: Bank will likely lose on 450k payments because it seems like an extraordinary transaction. Better chance that the interest payments fall into (c)(1)—it was incurred during ordinary course of business and could argue either ordinary business terms or ordinary terms course of business between the debtor/creditor

### PMSI Safe Harbor §547(c)(3)
  
* As long as perfection is within 30 days of the DR obtaining the collateral, it is NOT a preferential transfer so long as it is clear that the loan was intended for the DR to be able to purchase the collateral that secures the loan

* Hypothetical #1:
  * Setup
    * 3/1: loan and security agreement to give CR security interest in equipment
    * 3/15: DR buys equipment
    * 4/30: CR files (perfects)
    * 5/1: Bankruptcy
  * Bank must file within 30 days of DR obtaining collateral to be protected (did not here)

* Hypothetical #2:
  * Setup
    * 1/1: 100k loan, security agreement purports to give CR security interest in equipment [value is exchanged/promise made + agreement is entered into]
    * 2/1: DR buys equipment [creation—this is when the DR first had rights]
    * 2/15: CR files [perfection]
    * 3/1: DR files for bankruptcy
  * Can trustee make out an argument for preferential transfer under §547(b)?
  * Was there a transfer (exchange of value)? Yes. Security interest
  * When did transfer of value happen? 2/1. This is the date of transfer because the perfection date is within 30 days (on 2/15)
    * Note: DR does NOT have rights in this collateral until DR buys the property (equipment) on 2/1 despite the agreement previously.
  * Was this transfer to secure an antecedent debt? Yes. The creation date (2/1) is the date that the “transfer” occurred, which seems to be securing an antecedent debt (incurred on 1/1). Looks like a preference.
  * Does §547(c)(3) – safe harbor created for PMSIs apply? Yes
    * PMSI: when the loan is being used for the DR to obtain the collateral that secures the loan.
    * Note: PMSIs in consumer goods perfect automatically. NOT business PMSIs (like equipment here)
    * Question: how do you know when a loan is a PMSI if it doesn’t say in the security agreement? Have to show that this loan was intended for the DR to obtain this collateral. Need connection between the loan and the acquisition of the collateral. No bright line rule!!!
  * Note: If the DR never bought the goods, then the CR would simply be an unsecured creditor

### Future Advances (“Subsequent Advance”) Safe Harbor - §547(c)(4)

* Rule: when CR extends more credit after DR makes a payment, the earlier payment will be protected to the extent of the extended credit amount
  * Ex: CR extends $90 credit after DR makes a $100 payment. Only $10 is preferential, the $90 is deemed to fall under the subsequent advance safe harbor
  * Delivery of new supplies/new credit extension is NOT a preferential transfer (to the extent of the new supplies/credit extended)
* Note: does NOT apply if DR’s payment is secured (only if unsecured/otherwise exposed) OR if any other safe harbors apply
* Purpose being to encourage CRs to continue dealing with troubled debtors
* Skeel: cannot apply (c)(4) if the CR’s future advance is otherwise secured or protected/un-avoidable by another safe harbor (aka the CR would be paid regardless). Only use (c)(4) if the CR’s advance is exposed.

* Hypothetical #1:
  * Setup:
    * Day 1: CR ships $100 worth of supplies
    * Day 15: DR pays $100
    * Day 30: CR ships $125 worth of supplies
    * Day 45: DR pays $125
    * Day 60: CR ships $150 worth of supplies
    * Day 80: DR pays $150
    * Day 90: DR files for bankruptcy
  * Are any of these payments voidable preferences?
  * Trustee will argue that all of these payments are voidable under §547(b)—want to retrieve all payments (on Day 15; Day 45; Day 80) because they are all payments on account of an antecedent debt
  * Note: If other safe harbors were available, what would you argue? §547(c)(2) – ordinary course of business. These obligations were incurred in the ordinary course of business and payments were all made in the ordinary course of business/according to ordinary business terms
  * Does §547(c)(4) –future advances/subsequent advances safe harbor apply?
    * CR will argue that after the CR received payment he provided new value.
    * Look at Day15 payment, afterwards CR did extend new value (125 worth of goods)
    * Look at Day45 payment, afterwards CR did extend new value (150 shipment)
    * Look at Day 80 payment, NO more credit extended. SO, this is the only payment that could be voidable as a preferential transfer
  * Note: protections is ONLY to the extent of the future advance
    * Ex: if the Day15 payment is $100 and the Day30 shipment was worth $70, the protection would only be $70. This would mean that there is a voidable preference of $30.
    * Note: a future extension of credit later on could cover a previous preferential transfer in this series of events.
    * Ex: if there is a $30 preference on Day30, and on Day45 DR pays $125 and on Day60 CR extends $150. CR’s 150 extension of credit would cover the full 125 payment (Day45) and have $25 extra to cover the previous $30 preference, in which case there is only a $5 preference left.

* Hypothetical #2:
  * Setup:
    * Day 1: CR ships $100 worth of supplies
    * Day 15: DR pays $100
    * Day 30: CR ships $125 worth of supplies
    * Day 45: DR pays $125
    * Day 60: CR ships $150 worth of supplies
    * Day 80: DR pays $150 [made in the ordinary course of business, (c)(1) safe harbor applies]
    * Day 90: DR files for bankruptcy
    * Assume that Day 80 $150 payment is made in the ordinary course of business, then the Day60 credit does not count as a future advance for purposes of the safe harbor.
  * Now what?
    * Day 15 (100) payment is OK because of CR extending more credit on Day30 (125). The credit is more than the payment, so the DR’s Day15 payment is not preferential.
    * Day 45  (125) payment seems ok, BUT it isn’t because the Day60 extension of credit no longer makes the CR exposed because the Day80 payment is protected. This means that the $125 is a voidable preference and NOT covered by the (c)(4) future advances safe harbor.
  * Result: Cannot use the future advances safe harbor to protect the DR’s Day45 ($125) payment
    * Why? Because the CR is no longer deemed to be exposed for the Day60 extension of credit. The CR would be paid for regardless of the future advances protection
  * Rule: If one of the payments is protected because of a different safe harbor, then the “advance” connected to it can no longer count as a future advance. This is because the future advance sage harbor is intended to be used only to protect creditors who are exposed (not those that are secured or will be paid for some other reason regardless)

* Hypothetical #3:
  * Setup:
    * Day 1: CR ships $100 worth of supplies
    * Day 15: DR pays $100
    * Day 30: CR ships $125 worth of supplies
    * Day 45: DR pays $125
    * Day 60: CR ships $150 worth of supplies (secured by collateral worth $100)  under-collateralized
    * Day 80: DR pays $150
  * What would happen here?
    * Day15 (100) payment is still saved by the future advances safe harbor
    * Day45 (125) payment is made and then a $150 extension of credit is provided. BUT, now the CR is partially secured (100 in collateral) and is only exposed by $50. The $50 is protected by (c)(4), but the remaining $75 is a preferential transfer (125-50 = 75)
    * Day80 (150) payment is a preferential transfer because there is no extension of credit afterwards
  * Result: preferential transfer of $225 (75+ 150 = 225). This means that the CR would have to give $225 back to the estate. BUT the claim would be partially collateralized by $100

### Two-Point Net Improvement Test (§547(c)(5))
  
* Rule: When the collateral is inventory or accounts receivable, there wont be a preference as long as the CR is not better off in BR than it was in the preference period (aka not a preference unless CR is less under-collateralized in BR than they were 90 days before BR)
* Designed for inventory, accounts receivable loans (not equipment) that is constantly turned over
  * Example: Laser printers or other supplies at Staples. When current inventory is sold, Staples will buy a new one replacing the original one and the creditor’s security interest will transfer to the new replacement collateral. Old security interest in laser printer that was sold will transfer to the new printer that is attained. The transfer of the security interest looks like a preferential transfer, but not treated as such because of this safe harbor
* Assumes there is an after-acquired property clause in their contract
* Test: Compare how under-collateralized the CR was at two points: (1) 90 days before filing (OR time the loan was made if made after 90 days); (2) time of filing.
  * If the CR is less under-collateralized at the time of BR (i.e. in better shape), then the extent of the improvement is treated as a preference. The preference will be the difference in under-collateralization (i.e. improvement in position)
  * Note: if involving an insider, use the one year before bankruptcy time period instead of the 90 days
* Steps to Apply (c)(5):
  * Pre-Step: determine whether we are dealing with collateral that involves inventory or accounts receivable
  * (1) Determine how under-collateralized CR is 90 days before bankruptcy OR at the time of the loan if made after 90 days (aka closer to bankruptcy filing than 90 days)
  * Note: if 90 days before bankruptcy, the CR was fully secured. Then there is NO preference.
  * (2) Determine how under-collateralized CR is at the time of Bankruptcy
  * (3) If the value in (2) is LESS than the value in (1) … the CR is less under-collateralized at the time of BR (i.e. in a better position) and there IS a preference
  * (4) Determine the value of the preference by subtracting (1) – (2).
* Note: Only a preference to the extent that it PREJUDICES other creditors (ex: oil is the collateral and there is a change in oil prices)

* Hypothetical:
  * 90 days before bankruptcy:
    * Debtor owes $100k
    * Collateral = $60k (inventory)
  * At time of bankruptcy:
    * Debtor owes $90k
    * Collateral = $70k (inventory was sold, new inventory is worth more)
  * DR did two things: (1) made a $10k payment to CR (reducing the $100k loan to $90k); (2) got new inventory worth $10k more than the previous collateral
  * Rule: If you get new collateral within 90 day period, (c)(5) can apply so the transfer of security interest to the new collateral is not treated as a preferential transfer even though technically under §547(e)(3), there is no “transfer” until the DR has rights in the collateral
  * What does the trustee want to do? Argue that the 10k payment and entire security interest can be retrieved as a preferential transfer
  * If this was not an inventory loan (but an equipment loan), could it be saved?
    * No!

* Application of (c)(5) Safe Harbor
  * (1) Look to how under-collateralized the DR was 90 days before bankruptcy.
    * DR owed 100k, CR secured by 60k worth of inventory. CR is under-secured by $40k.
  * (2) Look at how under-collateralized the DR is at the time of bankruptcy filing.
    * DR owed 90k, CR secured by 70k worth of inventory. CR is under-secured by $20k.
  * (3) Since (2) is less than (1), we know that the CR is less under-collateralized at the time of bankruptcy (meaning CR is better off at time of bankruptcy). Thus, there was a preferential transfer
  * (4) To determine the amount of the preferential transfer subtract (1) –(2) = 40-20= 20k.
  * Result: remove the difference between the DR’s under-collateralized status. SO, there is only a $20k preference that trustee can avoid
    * Note: Can ignore payments within this 90-day period. Just focus on the relationship between the value of the collateral and the loan
  * Modification 1: what if at 90 days the collateral was worth 120k (making CR over-secured)?
    * Result: there would be no preference.
    * Rule: there is only a preference if the CR is under-collateralized at point one and less under-collateralized at point two
  * Modification 2: what if the inventory was not sold, but simply went up in value?
    * Result: there would be no preferences because there was NO transfer that occurred in the 90 days before bankruptcy
  * Modification 3: what if the inventory is sold and new inventory is purchased. But for some reason, the value changes because of a change in price of the commodity generally?
    * Result: some courts accept that there isn't really a preference because there is no prejudice to other CRs (Skeel isn’t persuaded by this argument)

### Third Party Transactions/Insider Preferences (§550(c))
  
* §550(a)(1) – Trustee can go after either the initial transferee or a person for whose benefit the transfer was made (often an insider in the case of a CEO guaranteeing a loan)
* §550(c)—Trustee’s power is limited to going after the insider if the transfer has occurred outsider the 90 day window. Trustee can still recover a transfer after 90 days by going after the insider.
* “Insider” (§101(31)): broadly defined, includes officers, directors, persons in control and family of DR.
  * If the trustee can show that a CR is actually “in control” of the DR then he may be able to take advantage of the one-year insider recovery period.

* Hypothetical:
  * Setup: Bank makes a $250k loan to the DR. President of the DR corporation has to make a personal guarantee on the loan.
    * 120 days before bankruptcy:
      * DR makes a payment of $50k
    * 80 days before bankruptcy:
      * DR makes a payment of $30k
  * Who does the trustee want to go after to retrieve the payments? Either the bank or the president of the DR’s corporation because both are CRs
    * President is a CR of DR because as a guarantor he holds a contingent claim (would have a right of indemnification against the DR in the event he had to pay)
  * Are both of these payments preferential transfers under 547(b)?
    * Day 80 payment is clearly
    * Day 120 payment is as well
      * Note: guarantor is an insider, which means that the window for preferential transfers is extended beyond 90 days to cover the payment at 120 days.
      * This payment can also be seen as “for the benefit” of a CR (§547(b)(1)). When the trustee made this payment, it was arguably for the benefit of the president
  * Who can the trustee recover the preferential transfers from?
    * Day 80 payment from either the Bank or the president (§550(a)(1))
    * Day 120 payment ONLY from the president (§550(c))—unless of course the Bank can be considered an insider of the DR
      * How can a bank be an insider of DR?
      * If owe equity in the corporation (rare)
      * If Bank has direct authority or indirect authority (control over the DR) – has someone who is an officer/director/board member of the corporation
      * Example: Worldcom in financial trouble needed to borrow money from group of lenders. Condition was that they needed to put in a restructuring officer. If DR selected one of 3 names lenders provided, they would lend them the money. Strategic way for bank to get control over DR
