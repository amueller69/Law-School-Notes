# Limits On The Discharge

* Discharge - Releases debtor from liability for certain debts and prohibits creditors from attempting to recover these discharged debts (e.g. through lawsuits, demand letter, etc.)
  * Once the process of Bankruptcy ends, earlier claims are eliminated so a creditor who fails to file a claim and realizes it only after discharge is out of luck
* Transition From Exemptions to Limits:
  * It turns out that sometimes absolute exemptions are abused and lead to the bankruptcy court imposing some limits on the debtor’s discharge; curbing the fresh start
  * General rule: The bankruptcy court allows for some strategic behavior (feeding the exemptions), but as the saying goes “when a pig becomes a hog, it gets slaughtered”. If the exemption is unlimited and the debtor takes advantage of it, he risks losing his whole discharge (e.g. case with unlimited insurance exception, rather than farmer case)

## Key Provisions

### §727(a) - Denials of Discharge

* Complete denial of discharge (all discharge is denied). States that debtor should be granted discharge unless one of the conditions in the subsections is met
  
* **§727(a)(1) - The debtor is not an individual**
  * Note: Only an individual is provided a discharge; not a corporation/other entity that can be dissolved after liquidation
  
* **§727(a)(2) - Actual fraud occurs with property of estate** - Transferred/concealed/removed/destroyed property within one year of filing with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or trustee
  * Note: Some pre-bankruptcy planning is allowed (consistent with the idea of a “fresh start”), so must be careful when seeking to invoke this provision that the conduct was truly meant to defraud
  
* **§727(a)(3) - Fraudulent or failure to provide financial records**. Debtor intentionally concealed, destroyed, or failed to keep records from which debtor’s financial condition could be ascertained
  
* **§727(a)(4)(A)/(B) - False oaths and claims**. Failure to disclose transfer or makes false statements or knowingly provided false claims
  
* **§727(a)(5) - Failure to explain satisfactorily any losses of assets**
  
* **§727(a)(6) - Failure to co-operate**. Refusal to obey lawful court order or respond to material question (including invoking 5th after immunity has been given)
  
* **§727(a)(8) - Chapter 7 Time Limitation**. Denies discharge to debtor who has previously received a discharge under Chapter 7 within 8 years of this case
  
* **§727(a)(9) - Chapter 13 Time Limitation**. Denies discharge to debtor who has previously received a discharge under Chapter 13 within 6 years of this case
  * Exception: If debtor paid all unsecured claims or 70% of such claims were paid and debtor made good faith, best effort

### §523(a) – Non-Dischargeable Debts

* Lists of debts that cannot be discharged or included in the bankruptcy process. Unlike §727(a) which takes away a debtor’s whole discharge, **§523(a) only denies the discharge with respect to the particular obligation**
* **§523(a)(2) – Fraudulently incurred debts**
  * §523(a)(2)(A) – Debts obtained by “**false pretenses, a false misrepresentation, or actual fraud**” are non-dischargeable
    * **Justifiable reliance** is required, thus must consider any red flags/anything that a credit card company, for example, should have been aware of
  * §523(a)(2)(B) — **False statements**. Must be materially false (related to financial condition), intended to deceive, and on which creditor reasonably relied
    * Note: In the credit card context, this would involve a false statement on an application about your credit situation
      * Credit cards rarely use this; difficult to establish because credit card companies don’t reasonably rely on that job info, salary, etc. (in fact even potentially encourage people to embellish on these sections)
  * §523(a)(2)(C) – **Luxury goods carve-out + cash advance**
    * Luxury Goods: Consumer debts to a single creditor used for purchasing luxury goods within 90 days of filing that exceed $650 creates a presumption of fraud (excludes goods/services reasonably necessary for support/maintenance of debtor)
    * Cash Advance: Cash advances totaling more than $925 within 70 days of filing are presumed non-dischargeable
  * Note: All of §523(a)(2) debts are also non-dischargeable in a Chapter 13 case
  
* **§523(a)(4) – Fraud or defalcation** - Includes embezzlement and larceny when acting in fiduciary capacity
  
* **§523(a)(5) – Domestic support obligations** - Alimony, child support, etc
  
* **§523(a)(6) – Willful & malicious injury** - Caused by debtor to another person or their property
  
* **§523(a)(8) – Educational loans** - Only if it would not create undue hardship. Very narrow/strict interpretation of undue hardship which makes this difficult to prove
  
* **§523(a)(9) – DUI debt** - Arising out of harm done while operating under influence
  
* **§523(a)(15) – Other debts incurred in divorce** - Separate from (5), this is related to property settlements

### §1328 – Deals with discharge in a Chapter 13 situation

* §1328(a) - Super Discharge. Also provides a list of non-dischargeable debts in a Ch. 13 case (incorporates some of the §523(a) non-dischargeable debts, but not all of them)
  * §1328(a)(2) - Main limitations on the super discharge
    * List of exceptions in §523(a) that are non-dischargeable in Ch. 13
      * §523(a)(2) – Fraudulently incurred debts
      * §523(a)(4) – Fraud or defalcation
      * §523(a)(5) – Domestic support obligations
      * §523(a)(8) – Educational loans
      * §523(a)(9) – DUI debt
  * Note: Does not include discharge willful or malicious injury
  * §1328(a)(3) - Restitution, criminal fine imposed on debtor for conviction of a crime
  * §1328(a)(4) - Restitution, damages awarded in a civil action against the debtor as a result of willful or malicious injury caused by debtor that resulted in personal injury
    * Note: this is only half of the §523(a)(6) – Willful or malicious injury to person/property non-dischargeable debt. Therefore, injury to property will be dischargeable in Chapter 13 cases
  
* §1328(b) – Hardship discharge in non-completed Ch. 13 plan
  * Applies in a situation where the debtor fails to complete a Ch. 13 plan, but tried really hard to comply. Hardship discharge (non-completed Ch. 13 plan)
  * Get a discharge for everything except your §523(a) non-dischargeable debts
  
* §1328(h)(2) – Cannot get discharge until after court can determine whether debtor will be found guilty of a felony
  * Essentially stops everything if it looks like debtor might be found guilty of a felony

## Comparing Discharge in Different Chapters

* Chapter 7 Discharge:
  * Only allow a discharge for an individual. Corporation/other entities do NOT get a discharge if liquidating
  * §727(b) – Discharge frees debtor from all debts arising before bankruptcy
  
* Chapter 11 Discharge:
  * A corporation that is reorganizing DOES get a discharge
  * Carve-out for non-individuals in the context of liquidation, do NOT get a discharge.
  
* Chapter 13:
  * Uncertain. Majority of debtors are individuals, but it is possible for a business to file for Chapter 13

* Chapter 7 v. Chapter 13 Discharges:
  * There are some debts that are non-dischargeable in Chapter 7 (under §523) that are dischargeable in Chapter 13 cases
    * Example: willful or malicious injury to property (e.g. trashing hotel room)
    * Note: This is because the legislature wanted to incentivize Chapter 13 filings
  * What are the advantages for an individual to file Ch. 7 rather than Ch. 13?
    * Get discharge immediately
    * Quick/straightforward especially if individual does not have any property

## Complete Denial of Discharge - Actual Fraud §727(a)(2)

* What factors would Court consider in deciding whether debtor’s pre-bankruptcy planning behavior should lead to §727(a)(2) discharge to be disallowed?
  * (1) Intentional misconduct - Whether debtor incurred debt as part of his plan to buy the $1M life insurance?
    * If yes -> no discharge allowed
    * If not -> discharge allowed
  * (2) How much debt does debtor have and whether debtor is putting all of its assets into exemption plans like life insurance plan?
    * If debtor puts all assets into exemption -> no discharge allowed
    * If debtor puts only some assets into exemption -> discharge allowed
  * (3) Did debtor sell assets to raise money and if so, did debtor sell property at fair market value or was there something off about the sales?
    * If debtor did not sell assets -> discharge allowed
    * If debtor sold asset at market value -> discharge allowed
    * If debtor sold assets at lower than market value or there’s something else off -> no discharge allowed
  * (4) If debtor sold property to raise funds for exemption, did debtor actually sell it, or did it sell to family/fake-sell?
    * If real sale -> discharge allowed
    * If fake sale -> no discharge allowed
  * (5) How big is the exemption?
    * If the exemption is unlimited or more than debtor will actually need for a fresh start -> no discharge allowed
    * If exemption is limited to what debtor will need for a fresh start -> discharge allowed

### Insurance Policy Hypothetical (Not Discussed in Class)

* Setup: PA allows debtor to exempt up to $500k of any whole life insurance policy. Debtor, whose only main asset is Matisse painting, sells Matisse to her sister for $500k; buys $500k worth of PA life insurance, and then files for Ch. 7
* Trustee's response in this situation depends on question of how much Matisse is worth
  * If worth $500k (i.e. has nothing other than the policy) -> Cannot use fraudulent conveyance argument
    * However, can object to the discharge through § 727(a)(2). Effect of the sale was to leave nothing for creditors, because what is left is exempt property. Argument that this was a design to hinder a creditor within one year of filing and should lead court to deny discharge to debtor
    * Debtor response: This was consistent with fresh start; Debtor can engage in pre-BR planning and that taking advantage of exemption on the eve of Bankruptcy is not by itself sufficient to justify denying the discharge)
  * If worth $2M:
    * Trustee would undo the transaction as a fraudulent conveyance. Estate entitled to the painting
      * Requirements for constructed fraudulent conveyance: debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent consideration, and debtor was insolvent
      * If family member acted in good faith, would probably be protected for the $500k she paid, but painting would come back into the estate
      * Trustee can also object to the discharge
  * The trustee’s two options: 1) go after it as a fraudulent conveyance; 2) object to the discharge

## Non-Dischargeable Debts - Domestic Support Obligation (§523(a)(5))

* §523(a)(5) – A domestic support obligation is not dischargeable
  
* Domestic support obligation: §101(14A)
  * “Debts owing to a spouse, former spouse or child of the debtor or governmental unit that is in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support and that is established by separation agreement, divorce decree, or property settlement agreement, a court order, or a determination made under non-bankruptcy law by a governmental unit”
  
* 6 Factors to Determine Whether Spousal Debt is DSO and thus non-dischargeable:
  1. Debt’s label
  2. If spouse/child has strong need for support
  3. If obligation terminates on death or remarriage of the receiving spouse
  4. If term is for a fixed time (factor AGAINST)
  5. If obligation subject to modification by the court
  6. If tax law treats the payments as alimony
  
* §523(a)(15) – Other debts a spouse/child incurred during divorce/separation (separate from (a)(5))
  * Note: While both (a)(5) and (a)(15) are both non-dischargeable debts in a chapter 7 case, only (a)(5) is non-dischargeable in chapter 13 case. This means that (a)(15) is dischargeable in a chapter 13 case, which is why classification of settlement arrangements under the two categories is so important.

### *In Re Werthen*

* Background Information: Granted that support payments (alimony) and divorce property settlements are non-dischargeable under both (5) and (15) respectively, why does it matter which it is categorized as?
  * Non-BR Reason: There is a tax difference. Alimony is taxed as income whereas property settlements are not. In the family law context, there is thus an incentive to classify settlements as a property settlements (avoid taxes on this arrangement)
  * BR Reasons:
    * At the time of *Werthen*, §523(a)(15) were dischargeable
    * §523(a)(5) obligations are non-dischargeable under both chapter 7 and 13 whereas §523(a)(15) is only non-dischargeable in Chapter 7
      * §1327(a)(2) "super discharge" was written to incentivize debtors to use Chapter 13 instead of 7
    * In Chapter 7, the §523(a)(5) obligations gets distribution priority at the end of BR
* Facts: Husband and wife divorce. Wife gets settlement judge separated into “child support” and “property division.” Part of the property division is composed of bonus payments and equity payments. Alimony was relatively low, so likely was the case that the alimony was incorporated into bonus payments in the settlement for tax purposes. However, if not an §523(a)(5), this would be dischargeable at this point in history
* Issue: Are the bonus payments/equity payments court listed as “property division” non-dischargeable?
* Rule: **An award designated as “property division” under a state divorce decree may be treated as an award of alimony or support under the Bankruptcy Code where there is evidence that the award was intended to serve as support**
* Holding: The obligation falls under §523(a)(5) and is thus non-dischargeable. Even though labeled as “property division,” the intent behind these payments was to insure adequate support for the wife and children so it should qualify as domestic support obligation

### Domestic Support Obligations vs. Property Settlement Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical #1: §523(a)(5) Support Obligations
  * Suppose we are in Chapter 7 and characterize a $100,000 as support obligation
  * Support obligation gets priority over unsecured claims (under §507) so creditor/ex-spouse would get a bigger payout and any amount that’s not paid back would still be non-dischargeable and could be collected through judicial lien
  * Takeaway: Both §523(a)(5) and §523(a)(15) are non-dischargeable in Chapter 7, but §523(a)(5) gets priority while §523(a)(15) does not under §507
  * Irony: Debtor-Spouse will actually prefer obligation to be labeled as support obligations, bc debtor will have to pay out that obligation to ex-spouse regardless (since it’s non-dischargeable), so spouse will rather pay out more to ex-spouse as part of bankruptcy and have less left over as non-dischargeable once bankruptcy ends

* Hypothetical #2: §523(a)(15) Property Settlement Obligations
  * Setup: Suppose we are in Chapter 7 and characterize a $100,000 as property obligation. After all secured creditors are paid, there’s $20K left
  * What would effect be of that overall?
    * Property obligation is an unsecured claim, so creditor gets a pro-rata of what’s left
    * So if there’s $1,000,000 of total unsecured claims, creditor/ex-spouse will get ```($100,000/$1,000,000)*$20,000 = $2,000``` OR (ex-spouse/creditor’s share/total unsecured claims) money left for unsecured creditors
    * Creditor/ex-spouse would be left with a claim for $98,000, which is not dischargeable, so creditor/ex-spouse can continue to try to collect using judicial lien. How does one collect?
    * From new property (paycheck, etc.) that debtor acquires after bankruptcy BUT NOT from property/interest that have been labeled as exemptions in bankruptcy!

## Non-Dischargeable Debts - Willful & Malicious Injury (§523(a)(6))

* §523(a)(6) – A debt for “willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity” is non-dischargeable
* Two Categories of “Willful & Malicious Injury”
  * (1) Personal Injuries
    * Examples: Intentional torts; setting fire to a house; bar fight
    * Requires actual intent to cause harm
    * Traditionally medical malpractice cases do NOT qualify unless there is actual malice
      * *Kawaauhau v. Geiger* - Plaintiff sought medical care of debtor. DR made wrong diagnosis that led to P’s food being amputated. P sued DR and obtained 300k judgment in medical malpractice case. Dr then filed for bankruptcy. Court held that this was NOT willful or malicious injury under §523(a)(6) and thus was dischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcy
  * (2) Conversion of Property
    * Note: Non-dischargeable so long as the debtor did not truly believe actions were lawful
  
* Hypothetical: Rockstar trashing hotel room and discharge under Chapters 7 and 13
  * Setup - Rockstar trashes hotel room doing $250k worth of damage to the property. He subsequently filed for bankruptcy
  * Chapter 7?:
    * The obligation is not dischargeable here. Debtor willfully/intentionally caused injury to the property thus it comes within §523(a)(6) exception
  * Chapter 13?:
    * This obligation is discharged at the end of BR. Willful/malicious injury to property is not an exception to discharge in Chapter 13

## Non-Dischargeable Debts — Fraudulently Incurred Debts (§523(a)(2))

* Reminder: A debtor who has obtained debts fraudulently (concealing assets, hiding info) may also be denied a discharge completely under §727(a)(2)
  
* §523(a)(2)(A)) - Debts obtained by “false pretenses, a false misrepresentation, or actual fraud” are non-dischargeable
  * Fraud = contracting debt intending not to pay
  * **Creditor can establish non-dischargeability by showing: the debtor knowingly made false representations for the purpose of deceiving and the creditor reasonably relied on such representations and sustained loss as a result**
  * Intent to defraud credit card company can be inferred by: Intervals/frequency/number/amount of charges, financial/employment status at time of charges, spending habits, etc.
  
* §523(a)(2)(B) – False statements
  * In the credit card context, false statements would be intentional mistakes on an application form
  * This is not a heavily used provision as it would be difficult to establish the requisite reliance because it is pretty common knowledge that no one uses these forms. Credit card companies will do just about anything to sign people up for new cards
  
* §523(a)(2)(C) – Presumption for luxury goods and cash advances
  * Debts to a single CR for luxury goods/services incurred on/within 90 days of BR aggregating more than $675 is presumed non-dischargeable
  * Cash advances aggregating more than $950 obtained on or within 70 days of filing for bankruptcy are presumed non-dischargeable

### Am Ex Travel v. Hashemi – Credit card fraud

* Facts: DR went on a six-week vacation to Europe and charged $60k on his credit card (more than a year of income). When he got home, he immediately filed for bankruptcy
* Issue: Although credit card debts are generally dischargeable, AmEx argues this should be non-dischargeable under §523(a)(2)(A). Does court agree?
* Holding: These debts are non-dischargeable
* Reasoning: Meets all of the common-law elements for fraud
  1. Fraudulent intent (charges exceeded yearly income, already in large amount of debt)
  2. False representations
  3. Justifiable reliance (no red flags that should’ve alerted credit card company of potential for problems)
     * Note: There were no red flags or other obvious reasons AmEx should question debtor and thus they were found to have “justifiably relied”
* Different from reasonable reliance
  * Justification is subjective to the abilities of the particular plaintiff and the circumstances of the particular case, rather than a community standard of reasonableness that applies to all cases
  * However, credit card companies assumed to have the capacity to recognize red flags and have compelling interest in performing an sufficient inquiry into DR's financial situation

### In Re Ellinsworth – Contrast to AmEx on issue of justifiable reliance in context of credit card fraud

* Facts: Credit card co offered debtor a pre-approved card based on a credit score they received. Debtor actually owed 65k on various other cards at the time. Credit Card co made no effort to get a full sense of debtor’s financial situation
* Holding: DR’s credit card debt is dischargeable
* Reasoning Even if debtor made false representations, credit card company **did not justifiably rely because it made no effort to make an adequate inquiry into debtor’s financial situation** when giving her the pre-paid card

## Non-Dischargeable Debts Educational Loans (§523(a)(8))

* Educational loans are non-dischargeable except in cases of “undue hardship”
* Student loans are really hard to get rid of. Why?
  * Because students have a lot of liability/very few tangible assets except for earning capacity. Fear is that if students could discharge loans, they would strategically file for bankruptcy
* **Brunner Test for “Undue Hardship”**:
  1. Debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a “minimal” standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay loans
  2. Additional circumstances exist that show this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of time
     * Circuit split regarding whether meaning. Some courts believe additional circumstances require serious illness; disability; lack of useable job skills; large number of dependents (4th Cir). Others do not (9th Cir)
  3. Debtor has made good faith efforts to repay loans

### Student Loan and Credit Card Debt Hypothetical

* Setup: Third year law student with a big job in NY firm to begin in September
  * July 1: $30k cash advance from credit card company; paid student loans (30k)
    * Why? Credit card debt easier to discharge than student loans
  * Late July: Takes bar exam
  * August 1-15: Trip to Asia. $25k worth of credit card debt
  * August 20: Buys patented Trump (gold-plated) furniture on credit for his apartment ($30k Trump store)
  * August 25: Law firm rescinds his offer
  * August 26: Completely broke, gets arrested for shoplifting
  * September 1: Files for bankruptcy
* Three Main Groups of Creditors:
  * (1) Government (for student loans)
    * Debtor now owes $70k (paid down $30k with cash advance)
  * (2) Credit Card Companies
    * Debtor owes $55k
  * (3) Trump Store
    * Debtor owes $30k
* Question:  Are any of these debts dischargeable?
* Student Loan Obligations? No:
  * §523(a)(8) - Students loans are generally non-dischargeable unless the situation meets the undue hardship exception
  * Here, debtor probably does not satisfy the undue hardship exception. A good degree from a great law school will make it hard for the court to sympathize, as debtor still has large earnings potential. However, possible that the criminal conviction will make it difficult for debtor to obtain a job now/get admitted to the Bar
  * While there is argument that debtor satisfies all components of *Brunner* test, government could counter that there was no good faith effort to pay back loans since this was pre-BR planning intended to transfer debt to type that is dischargeable
* Credit Card Debt? No:
  * Cash advance within 70 days is presumed to be non-dischargeable (§523(a)(2)(C))
  * Company will also argue that fraud is present (possibility to use the basic §523(a)(2)(A) because the cash advance suggests there was no intention to pay back since credit was used to pay off student loans, which not dischargeable, whereas loans from credit cards may be
    * Most courts take view under view that there is nothing that raises a red flag, it is justifiable reliance; debtor could argue that $40K cash advance is a red flag that credit card company should not have justifiably relied on (under *Hashemi* majority view)
    * Student may counter by arguing that he racked up credit card debt with expectation that he would soon be making ~$160,000 which would enable him to easily pay this back
  * Luxury goods exception (§523(a)(2)(C)(i)) might also apply
    * Would require analysis of purchases on vacation to determine if required aggregate amount is exceeded
* Trump Store? No:
  * Luxury goods exception (§523(a)(2)(C)(i)) would apply and make this debt non-dischargeable
