## Introductory Lectures

* Don't need to be insolvent in order to file for bankruptcy
  * It is really hard to demonstrate solvency or insolvency at the outset of a case. Thought to be cumbersome, thus assumed to be insolvent
  * Even if not insolvent, bankruptcy can still be useful
* In the absence of bankruptcy, there would be an uncoordinated attempt to recover assets
  * Under Baird-Jackson Creditor's Bargain theory, bankruptcy should provide a collective forum for dealing with companies in financial distress
* Stay pauses litigation, court
* Property interest is an interest-in-the-thing-itself (iitti)
* Security interest satisfied through a Value Agreement and Rights (VAR)
* Perfection
  * Filing notice
  * Taking possession (physical control in the case of tangible property)
  * PIMSI for automatic perfection, though in the context of consumer goods only
* Hierarchy of Creditor Priority
  1. Perfected property interest
  1. Employees
  1. Unperfected property interest
  1. Unsecured creditors
  1. Remaining is distributed among debtor's shareholders or equity holders

  Administrative Expenses (including attorney fees)
  Administratively insolvent

* Steps in the bankruptcy proceedings
  1. Commencement
     * §301 – voluntary bankruptcy filing (gate-keeping provision, very broad)
       * An entity that may be a debtor under a particular chapter (defined in §109) may commence a voluntary bankruptcy case… (loose requirement that you be a “debtor”)
       * Note: must say what chapter you are filing (must designate exit at commencement). So, when you file for bankruptcy, you must file under a particular chapter
     * §303 - Involuntary filing (very rare - 1% of cases)
     * §109 –provides who can be a “debtor” in a particular chapter and provides the debt ceilings for each chapter
       * Entities that do NOT fit within §109 (explicitly excluded from bankruptcy)
         * Commercial banks
           * Note: commercial banks are those that take deposits, issues loans. NOT an investment bank, which can file for bankruptcy
         * Insurance companies
  1. Creation of Estate - (*aka the pie to be divided*)
     * Available assets for creditors = “property of the estate”
     * Basic rule: anything that the debtor has an ownership right in becomes part of the estate
     * Starts with everything and then has other provisions that either extend the estate or contract the estate
     * Provisions that expand the estate (add to the estate):
       * **§544** – Trustee’s Strong Arm Provision (trustee has the power to avoid unperfected property interests –used to avoid a security interest, mortgage, unperfected judicial lien that is unperfected)
         * Note: does NOT remove the claim, just the security interest
       * **§547** – Preference Provision (payments to creditors within **90 days** before filing for bankruptcy must be returned)
         * Expands the estate by avoiding preferential transfers
       * **§548** – Fraudulent Conveyances
         * Allows transaction to be reversed (returned to the estate) if debtor enters into a transaction **within 2 years of a bankruptcy** either (1) intending to defraud creditors or actually defrauds creditors OR (2) receives disproportionally low amount for the transaction (less than reasonably equivalent)
           * Classic Example: Selling house for $1 while under financial duress, effectively defrauding creditors
           * Paying large bonuses prior to filing
           * Organization restructures itself shortly prior to filing for bankruptcy for the purpose of getting assets away from creditors
     * **§522** – Exemptions (Provision that protects property belonging to the estate from being seized by creditors)
       * Applies to consumer bankruptcies only – it is a list of property that consumer debtors get to keep when they file for bankruptcy
       * This is also regulated by state law (e.g., homestead exemption)
       * DRs sometimes get a choice between federal and state exemptions (though majority have states have taken this choice away by compelling use of  state exemptions)
  1. Executory Contracts - Falls between the “Estate Phase” and the “Claims Phase”
     * §365 - Requires that there is a mid-stream contract – i.e., an obligation that is ongoing and effective and is active at the time of the bankruptcy
       * There must be an obligation on the part of both parties for the contract to be executory – neither party has fully performed
       * Extremely important and gives the debtor a lot of power – although on its face the section seems to allow debtors to get out of any contract, judges have not interpreted it this way.
     * Executory Contract: ongoing contracts; contracts on which material performance is still due on both sides
     * If the debtor wants to keep the contract in place he can assume it and then it becomes part of the estate
       * Assumption of the contract is the default
       * Debtor can even assume a contract that has been defaulted on prior to bankruptcy
     * If the debtor does NOT want to keep the contract in place he can breach/reject the contract and the contract rights become an unsecured claim of the creditor
       * Great source of power. Allows the debtor to get rid of some contracts he would not otherwise be able to outside of bankruptcy
       * E.g., car makers were able to terminate many of their dealerships; celebrities sometimes try to use this provision to get out of contracts (see Korrupt)
       * Idea is also used to terminate CBAs – see §1113
  1. Claims - (*aka who gets a piece of the pie and how big*)
     * §501 – Gate-keeping provision
       * Creditors may file a claim (like §301 in that it is extremely broad and not that informative)
     * §502 - Gives the court the power to set the amount of a claim
       * Sets forth the rules for when a claim has to be allowed or not
       * This section kicks in when somebody (usually the debtor) objects to a claim
       * Post-petition interest is not part of the claim for unsecured creditors
     * §506 – Property interest (secured creditor) section
       * If a secured creditor (someone with a property interest) has property interest worth less than they are owed, that property interest is both secured and unsecured
         * If secured creditor is under-collateralized, they have a secure claim up to the value of the collateral and an unsecured claim for the rest
       * Over-secured creditors get interest payments
  1. Operations
     * §362 — Automatic Stay
       * Enormous level of protection for debtors
       * When the debtor files for bankruptcy, there is an automatic stay. This says that creditors have to immediately cease and desist the moment debtor files for bankruptcy. Cannot go to state courts (prevents creditors from suing to collect judgments); call debtor; solicit payment in anyway
       * Furthers the goals of bankruptcy: (1) prevent a race to the courthouse; (2) allow for a collective solution to the problem that is better for all creditors
     * Creditor’s bargain theory: (Douglas Baird; Thomas Jackson) core purpose of business bankruptcy is to provide a collective solution to financial distress. Key is the automatic stay
     * §363 – Gives the trustee in a bankruptcy case the power to use, sell, dispose of property of the debtor outside of the ordinary course of business as long as there is notice, hearing, and court approval
       * This is the provision the court used in Chrysler to get through the bankruptcy process so quickly
       * Creditors have a chance to object to proposed 363 sales at a hearing
       * In the last 10-15 years, 363 has been used to sell major assets/pieces of the business prior to Chapter 11 reorganization making reorganization more theoretical (since the prime assets have been sold off).
       * §363(b) - Sale of assets of the corporation (most common)
         * Trustee must seek court approval (after notice and hearing) to do anything unusual
         * Turned into a go to provision although not intended to allow for sale of corporations
     * §364 – Financing Provision
       * Facilitates borrowing by debtors when they are in bankruptcy
       * Turns out to be one of the most important provisions in Chapter 11 (American business bankruptcy)
       * Gives the court a lot of discretion to approve lending. If the debtor wants to get debtor-in-possession financing the, court has privileges it can give to the loan.
         * Not only can court give lender administrative expense status or a lien, it can give a lien that takes priority over all other liens (priming lien)
         * Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession is distinguishing provision of American bankruptcy
       * Recently (in the last year or so) the government has become the biggest debtor-in-possession lender. This has really been in the auto industry bankruptcies
  1. Exit
     * Chapter 7 - Liquidation
       * Liquidation for both individuals and corporations (most commonly for individuals, but also for corporations that cannot use Chapter 11)
         * In many consumer bankruptcies, Chapter 7 is an immediate discharge because consumers have no assets that are not exempt
       * Trustee is appointed, who is responsible for selling off any assets and distribute proceeds among the creditors
       * §725 - Property interests gets paid off first
       * §726 - Priority interests below property interest
         * Directs you to §507 for priority rules
     * Chapter 13 - Wage Earner Plans
      * Individual reorganization plans
     * Chapter 11 - Restructuring
