# Introduction to Bankruptcy and State Collection Law

## Introduction

* Bankruptcy is federal law, but includes a lot of state law
  * Long codified as title 11 of the U.S.C.
  * Supplemented by sections of title 18 (bankruptcy crimes) and title 28 (jurisdiction)
  * Bankruptcy Rules promulgated by SCOTUS governs procedure
* Substantive rights of debtors and creditors are largely governed by applicable state law
  * When in doubt, apply state law, especially regard to property – see *Butner*
* While early bankruptcy was seen primarily as a creditor's remedy, it has evolved as the most important remedy available to debtor's and an overwhelming majority of cases are filed voluntarily
* Don't need to be insolvent in order to file for bankruptcy
  * It is really hard to demonstrate solvency or insolvency at the outset of a case. Thought to be cumbersome, thus assumed to be insolvent
  * Even if not insolvent, bankruptcy can still be useful
* In the absence of bankruptcy, there would be an uncoordinated attempt to recover assets
  * Under Baird-Jackson Creditor's Bargain theory, bankruptcy should provide a collective forum for dealing with companies in financial distress
* Two main goals of Bankruptcy are:
  1. Equally situated creditors should be treated equally
  1. Promoting fresh start
* Usual bankruptcy length: 1-2 years
* Types of Bankruptcy
  * Chapter 7 – Liquidation: all property of the debtor owned at the date of bankruptcy becomes part of the bankruptcy estate.  Individuals can exempt certain property.  Personal debtor discharged from personal liability
  * Chapter 13 – Individual who owes unsecured less than $307,675 and secured of less than $922,975.  Debtor gets discharge without losing nonexempt property.  Must formulate plan over 5 years; doesn't have to be approved by creditors, but by bankruptcy court.  Can't be confirmed over creditor objections unless certain requirements are met
  * Chapter 11 – individuals and business orgs.  Debtor is normally allowed to keep assets and continue operation.  Proposes plan where creditors paid over time.  Confirmation of plan only after it has been voted on by various classes of creditors and shareholders.  Then confirmed by court.  Normally get discharge of all pre-confirmation debt

## Secured v. Unsecured Creditors

* Secured creditor: has a security interest (e.g., mortgage, collateral such as equipment, real property, real estate, etc.)
  * Debtor has committed property to the repayment of the loan
  * When the borrower defaults, the secured CR has a quick state remedy – foreclosure
* Unsecured CR: does not have a security interest/has no collateral for the loan
  * When the borrower defaults, an unsecured CR has to go to the court for relief – get a judgment and then enforce
* Benefits of obtaining a security interest:
  * Priority over those with unsecured interest
  * Skip litigation process if debtor defaults (saves an incredible amount of time)
  * Secures repayment. In the case of default, can seizure property to pay (foreclosure)
  * If collateral is sold, Art. 9 automatically gives secured creditor an interest in the proceeds of this sale

## Liens

### In General

* A lien is an interest in the debtor's property obtained by the creditor to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation. Bankr. Code § 101(37)
* Liens are of paramount importance in bankruptcy. Creditor whose debt is secured by a lien in the debtor's property has absolute priority over other creditors who have no lien or a lien with lower priority
* Liens are obtained in three ways
  1. By voluntary grant by the debtor (Consensual Liens)
  1. By judicial action taken by the creditor (Judicial Liens)
  1. By statute because of the status of the particular creditor (Statutory Liens)

### Consensual Liens

* Security Interests in Personal Property
  * UCC Article 9 Security Interest applies to "a transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property"
  * All security interests in personal property are guided governed by UCC Article 9
  * Creation of the security interest under Article 9 - 3 Requirements
    * Uses the term “Attachment” to refer to creation (Note: can also be garnishing someone's wages)
    * First requirement: Value has been given
      * That the secured creditor (bank for example) has either made a loan or committed to make a loan to the debtor
      * Does not need to actually give it yet, suffices to have a contractual obligation to give it in the future
    * Second requirement: Agreement
      * There must be an agreement creating the security interest (normally a security agreement)
      * The debtor has to commit to giving the security interest. Must either authenticate the agreement describing collateral or agrees to security interest and transfers collateral to secured party
      * Most recent revision of Article 9 said that you can make your collateral description be as broad as you want—“all current and after acquired property”—as long as the debtor agrees
    * Third requirement: Rights
      * The debtor has to have rights to the collateral
      * Example: if the agreement purports to give security interest to neighbor's car, the debtor clearly has no rights to this
        * Ambiguous in case of timeshares (the only thing you could give a security interest in is the two-weeks you get, not the value of the whole property)
    * These events can occur in any order
    * Attachment continues even if the collateral is transferred unless the creditor agrees; and has interest in money or property received in exchange; and any property acquired by the proceeds
    * Scope of Security Interest - Can be really broad
      * Article 9 allows creditor to take security interest in current personal property owned and future property (“after acquired personal property”)
        * **After-Acquired Property Clauses**:
          * Creditors can include provisions in their credit agreements that say that the creditor has an interest in all of the debtor's property, including property currently purchased and that purchased after the agreement is entered into
        * Can secure this loan as well as subsequent loans by this same creditor (future advances clause)
        * **Future Advances Clauses**:
          * Allows for subsequent loans by this same creditor to be secured
          * Future advances still have the priority of the original agreement
          * Note: Courts tend to be pretty generous that any future advances will be covered if there is a future advances clause
        * If the collateral is sold, Article 9 automatically gives the secured creditor an interest in the proceeds of the sale. If the sale was unauthorized, the security interest may also continue in the original collateral itself
          * Note: Perfection may be temporary (See below)
  * Perfection of a SI – makes a SI good against the rest of the world
    * Perfection secures the security interest against third parties. Must perfect to have priority over subsequent creditors who also have a security interest in the same property. I.e. someone who gets a judicial lien. Unperfected interest is also subordinated to title of third parties who buy the collateral. Unperfected security interests, although enforceable against debtor, are given little protection against claims of third parties
    * UCC 9-303-perfection is attachment and applicable steps for perfection-action by secured party giving notice of the security interest
    * Two perfection methods:
      1. **Possession** (tangibles)
         * With respect to financial instruments/assets, can be obtained by taking "control of" the account where assets are held
      1. **Filing** in a designated public office of a notice of a secured transaction (intangibles or where possession unavailable)
         * Usually done with document called a financing statement
         * This notice is not informative (i.e. “notice filing”). It contains only name of debtor and SP and indicates collateral. Instead, the burden is on the third party to determine the nature of the transaction
         * Filing before making loan ensures perfection at time of attachment
         * Automatically granted attachment to proceeds 20 days after collateral is sold. Depending on the case, you may have to re-file after those 20 days
    * Some instances where this happens automatically
      * No need to file; no need to take possession
      * Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI): Security interest is automatically given to a creditor if the creditor financed the debtor's purchase of the item. Where the credit itself made it possible for the debtor to obtain the property. Get other special perks as well
        * Consumer PMSI (for consumer goods) are deemed automatically perfected
          * Example: Go to Target and buy a microwave. Pay with a credit card (purchase on credit = loan). Target does not have to file a financing statement
          * Exception - Cars that must be perfected by compliance with state certificate of title laws (notice of security interest must be on certificate of title)
        * Theory is that everyone would know there is a security interest on a consumer good; it would be stupid to impose the expense of a filing statement on creditors. Downside is that not everyone actually knows there is a security interest on these goods
    * Priority goes to the **first filer** of the financing statement under UCC
      * Exceptions: PMSI & Ordinary Course of Business
      * If the debtor sells the collateral in the ordinary course of business, then you do not retain a security interest in the collateral itself, but it attaches to the proceeds of the sale. A buyer who buys something in the ordinary course of business, then they can assume it is not subject to anyone else's interest in the property.
  * Default:
    * Unsecured creditor - Must sue for judgment; or may in some states sue for pre-judgment attachment (see below; not same as UCC attachment)
    * Secured creditor - No need for judgment; often gets paid w/o court intervention or summary procedure. UCC allows secured creditor to take possession of collateral w/o breach of the peace-this as a practical matter limits self help to voluntarily given possession or repossession of cars left in a public place where debtor is not there. Alternative is summary proceeding
    * Where creditor has possession, can sell or otherwise dispose of. If proceeds deficient, must sue for the deficiency
    * Secured party's remedies are cumulative-foreclosure, and/or judgment.
* Security Interests in Real Property
  * There are three types of prevalent real property security devices in the United States:
     1. **Mortgage**: Grants the mortgagee a security interest in the land
        * Some jurisdictions use the old definition of mortgage (title theory) – that a mortgage conveys title to the mortgagee with a right to take possession. But the “lien” view, in which mortgagee merely has security interest is much more popular
        * Modern mortgages are contracts that are enforced by courts according to contract law
        * Historically, default on mortgage lost all interest in land. In the present day, debtor's interest under a mortgage is described as the "equity of redemption", permitting them to redeem property by repaying debt
        * No more strict foreclosure (prohibited in most states), instead property sold and any surplus over debt returned to mortgagor
     1. **Deed of Trust**: The trustor (debtor) conveys legal title to a trustee in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary (creditor). This allows a trustee to sell the property for the benefit of the CR on default by the trustor
        * Nowadays the deeds of trust and mortgages have essentially melded together – mortgages normally contain enforceable powers of sale, and the trustor/beneficiary relationship largely parallels modern mortgagor/mortgagee relationships
     1. **Installment Sale Contract**: The seller sells land to the buyer on the condition that title will pass to the buyer only when the buyer has completed the installment payments called for by the contract
  * Security interest may arise only where there is an obligation to be secured
  * Perfection is done by recordation of the mortgage document. But the mortgagee has priority over third parties who know of the mortgage even if it is not recorded. Also a judicial lien creditor whether or not he knows of the mortgage, can take only subject to it
  * Open end mortgages where mortgagee may advance additional funds on request, or construction mortgages where funds are advanced with completion of the structure:
    * Advances made pursuant to a commitment take priority from date of commitment
    * Optional advances relate back to the date of the mortgage only if made by the mortgagee w/o knowledge of an intervening security interest. So second mortgagee assures priority by notifying first mortgagee
  * Default: States vary on whether remedies are cumulative as with personal property, or a choice by suing for a judgment or foreclosure, or one action-foreclose and ask for deficiency judgment at the same time
  * **Judicial Foreclosure** - Mortgagee sues to foreclose, junior lienholders are joined, court orders a sale; public sale occurs after statutory notice, proceeds pay the mortgage debt. Surplus goes to junior creditors and rest to debtor. If there is a deficiency, it is assessed as a personal judgment against debtor. If sale conforms to statute, it will not be able to be challenged for fetching too low a price
  * **Power of Sale** - Contained in the mortgage document. Gives mortgagee the power to do the foreclosure sale w/o judicial proceeding. Mortgagee forfeits right to any deficiency judgment. Does not resolve disputes by competing creditors
  * **Statutory Redemption** - Debtor may redeem from the foreclosure sale within a statutory period

### Judicial Liens

* Unsecured creditor remedies - sue for repayment **under state law**
* **Pre-Judgment Liens - Attachment Liens**
  * (1) Garnishment-go into accounts/payroll and take money
  * (2) Right of prejudgment attachment of property (if afraid debtor will move assets abroad).  This is not creation of a security interest
  * These remedies have been curbed by SCOTUS and now are usually limited to cases of fraud, basis to believe debtor will conceal assets, debtor not a resident of the state, contract claims where amount owed is ascertainable, etc
  * Usually only if court decides on the probable validity of the creditor's claim
  * Debtor can usually prevent with a surety bond
  * These are not constitutional unless the debtor is provided with a hearing and notice.
* **Judgment Liens**
  * A general lien which arises after judgment is obtained in favor of the creditor
    * It applies to all of the property to which a judgement lien can apply
  * A judgment makes an unsecured creditor a judgment creditor
    * The judgment creditor can go after property and assets
  * Perfection - Sometimes perfection is automatic
    * Sometimes has to be docketed (up to creditor to make sure and notify debtor) and get a writ of execution (see below), but this usually only applies to real property
    * You need perfection to get priority
  * Attaches to all real property of the judgment debtor in the county where the judgment is docketed. Usually attaches to after-acquired property also. Life of the judgment is usually around 10 years. Can be renewed
  * In a few states it attaches to personal property also
  * Creditor can obtain sale of the property similar to judicial foreclosure
* **Execution Liens**
  * A specific lien which attaches to the property on which levy is made under the writ of execution
  * Writs of execution - Usually apply to personal property since judgement liens generally do not attach to this
    * You need to get a writ of execution to enforce the lien **in addition to** the judgment being obtained
  * Judgment: Lienholder obtains sale by levying property pursuant to a writ of execution. Levying officer records the writ or notice of levy in the land records. The execution lien arises when this recording occurs for real property (varies by state, might be additional sale procedures). For tangible personal property, it occurs with physical seizure, or notice of levy (depends on state). For intangible personal property, it is done by garnishment of accounts or wages
  * Perfection: for personal property, execution lien is inchoate until the levying officer levies the property in some states. Not perfected until the actual levy. Often difficult because levying officers work slowly or reluctant to size property due to elected status. Until perfected, you are like an unsecured creditor if the debtor goes into bankruptcy. Other states only require the writ of execution for perfection
  * CR could also seize the property themselves as long as there is no breach of peace
    * Breach of peace used to mean threat of violence, but now there can't be a scene – basically, DR needs to either not know or allow CR to take

## Priority

* General Rule: First to (1) file or (2) perfect gets priority
  * Exceptions:
    * Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI) gets special priority above all
      * The PMSI's priority attaches only to that specific piece of the DR's property (even if that CR has interests in other pieces of DR's property). This is justified because a special relationship is formed between the DR and CR as to this specific piece of property – the PMSI CR gets priority because of this
    * Buyer in the Ordinary Course of Business: if the debtor is in the business of selling something, the consumer is going to assume that the debtor can sell/perform his business free of liens. Thus, if the debtor sells the collateral and the sale is authorized, a buyer who buys takes it free of any existing security interests (ie later buyer has priority over the earlier lender)
      * CR made it possible for DR to buy the item, or CR is selling the item
      * Car dealership example: the bank might have security interests in all of the dealership's cars, but the buyer's interest in the car takes precedence over the bank's when the car is purchased (despite the first in time rule). The bank can seize the proceeds from the dealership
* Basic Priorities **Outside** Bankruptcy:
  1. Perfected property interests
     * If more than one, first in time rule
  2. Unperfected property interests
     * Creditor still has rights against the debtor but has not gone through the perfection processes
     * Note: you would be an unperfected property interest holder if you make a mistake in the perfection process for instance
     * In many state real estate law, an unperfected mortgage has even more priority (over judicial liens for instance)
  3. General unsecured creditors
     * Creditors that do NOT have any property interest
  4. Equity
     * The debtor or shareholders of the corporation or whomever has ownership interest in the debtor
* Basic Priorities **Inside** Bankruptcy:
  1. Perfected property interests
  2. Administrative expenses /other special priorities
     * I.e. attorney's fees etc.; Domestic Support Expenses; Employees; IRS and other enumerated priorities in Bankruptcy Code
  3. General unsecured creditors  
     * In bankruptcy, unperfected property interests are lumped in this category
  4. Equity
     * Remaining is distributed among debtor's shareholders or equity holders
* Differences in priority inside/outside bankruptcy:
  * Inclusion of special priorities for administrative expenses second/right after perfected property interest holders
    * Attorney's fees, professionals, employees on paid wages
    * Domestic support obligations trump these admin expenses
  * Unperfected property interests get wiped out inside bankruptcy and turned into general unsecured claims. This does not mean that the claim disappears, only that the property interest does (The claim turns into an unsecured claim)
    * Trustee has power to ‘avoid' unperfected security interest
  * **Pro Rata Rule**: All remaining assets divided equally among pool of unsecured creditors
