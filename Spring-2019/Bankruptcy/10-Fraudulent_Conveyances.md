# Trustee’s Powers – Fraudulent Conveyances

## Key Provisions

### Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (state law version that can be invoked in bankruptcy through §544(b)(1))

* Basically the same as federal version found in §548 - "A transfer is fraudulent (whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made) if the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor"
  * §4(a)(1) – Actual fraud
  * §4(a)(2) + §5(a) – Constructive fraud
    * Show property sold for a price that was not reasonably equivalent to the value
    * AND debtor was engaged in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of DR were unreasonably small - (§4(a))(2)
    * OR the debtor was insolvent at that time or as a result of the transaction (§5(a))
  * §4(b)  Badges of Fraud - “in  determining actual intent...consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:
    * (1) Transfer to an insider
    * (2) Debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred
    * (3) The transfer concealed
    * (4) Debtor sued or threatened with suit before the transfer was made
    * (5) Transfer of substantially all the debtor's assets
    * (6) Debtor absconded
    * (7) Debtor removed or concealed assets;
    * (8) Value of consideration received by the debtor was not reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred
    * (9) Debtor insolvent or rendered insolvent
    * (10) The transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred
    * (11) Debtor transferred essential assets to creditor who transferred assets to an inside
* Two Key Differences:
  * UFTA has a longer statute of limitation (4 years), compared to the 2 years allowed in §548
  * UFTA §8 provides for a complete defense (good faith buyer of fraudulently transferred good does not have to give back the property) for a case that deals with actual fraud, whereas §548(c) and §550(b) offer a partial defense

### §544(b)(1) – Trustee In Bankruptcy Has Derivative Rights of CRs Under State Law (including UFTA)

* §544(b) Trustee has right to invoke any non-BR law that any existing creditor can invoke outside of BR
  * Gives the trustee the potential to take advantage of longer state law statute of limitations for fraudulent conveyances
* Only applicable if there is a creditor who would have this right under applicable law
* Using § 544(b) and pulling in UFTA allows trustee not just to do what creditor could have outside Bankruptcy, but allows trustee to completely wipe out the transaction
* If anyone could have avoided a small part outside Bankruptcy, can avoid ENTIRE transaction inside Bankruptcy
  * Where this matters: leveraged buyout transactions; restructuring of business (Caesar’s restructuring left creditors of operating company much more vulnerable than they were before); payments to executives right before firm files for Bankruptcy (AIG in 2008)

### §548 – Fraudulent Conveyances

* Trustee can avoid transfers made within 2 years where DR acted with
  * (1) **actual** intent to hinder, delay, defraud creditors OR
  * (2) Engaged in a transfer that wasn’t for a reasonably equivalent value while insolvent – **constructive** fraud
    * Instead of insolvency, can also be satisfied if would leave DR's business with unreasonably small amount of capital or intended to to incur debts beyond ability to pay
  * Note: Trustee must prove insolvency or one of the others (no presumption like in voidable preferences section)
* §548(a)(1) – Actual Fraud
  * Trustee must show that the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud an entity to which DR became indebted to
  * “Badges of Fraud” (Indicators of Intent to Defraud)
    1. Insider relationship between parties
    2. Retention of possession, benefit, or use of property
    3. Lack or inadequacy of consideration for property transfer
    4. Financial condition of DR before and after the transaction
    5. Series of transactions/course of conduct
    6. General chronology of events
    7. An attempt by DR to keep the transfer a secret
  * Classic example: D deeds interest in residence to her mom for no consideration after causing a car accident. D continues to live in the residence
* §548(a)(2) – Constructive Fraud
  * Trustee must show:
    * (1) DR received less than reasonable equivalent value in exchange for the transfer of obligation
    * (2) DR was insolvent at the time of the transfer OR became insolvent because of the transfer (no presumption)
      * Several different tests for insolvency: Insolvency (assets are less than liabilities)/small capital/equitable insolvency
  * Note: special case for Religious or Charitable Donations
    * Religious or charitable donations are allowed so long as…
      * (1) Contribution does not exceed 15% of debtor’s gross annual income in the year the transfer was made OR
      * (2) If it is greater than 15%, the contribution is consistent with past practices
    * But payment of a “pledge” within 90 days may be avoided as a preference
* §548(c) – Defenses available to recipients of fraudulent conveyances for good faith purchaser
  * A transferee that takes for value and in good faith may retain any interest transferred to the extent that such transferee gave value to DR in exchange for such transfer
  * Applicable for constructive and actual fraud
  * Provides a partial defense up to the value given.
  * Note: There is a complete defense for actual fraud under UFTA (DR/trustee cannot get anything back)

### §550 - Liability Of Transferee Of Avoided Transfer

* §550((a) – Who trustee can recover fraudulent transfers from…
  * Trustee can either recover fraudulent transfers from (1) initial transferee or (2) immediate/mediate transferee
  * Note: trustee’s powers to recover fraudulent transfers also applies to a debtor-in-possession in a chapter 11 case (§1107(a)) OR maybe even a creditor’s committee (although there is no statutory authorization for the committee)
* §550(b) – Defense for good faith purchaser. Limitation on who trustee can recover fraudulent transfers from…
  * The trustee may not recover from (1) a transferee that takes for value in good faith and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer avoided or (2) any immediate or mediate good faith transferee of such transferee
  * Note: A transferee who acquired the property from the DR in good faith but for a value that was not reasonably equivalent is partially protected. Trustee can recover the property or a money judgment, but the trasnferee/purchaser is entitled to offset against that recovery the value that had been given to the DR for the property
    * Ex: Good faith purchaser who bought the painting for 250k (when the painting was worth 500k) would have to give painting or 500k back, but would have a lien for 250k
    * Skeel says a good faith purchaser who bought painting for 2M when it was worth 500k would have a lien for 2M
  * §550(b)(2)-- Subsequent good faith purchasers (bought not from DR but from transferee who bought from DR) is completely protected regardless of whether they paid a reasonable price

## Overview of Fraudulent Conveyance Law

* Definition: transfers where DR acted with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud CRs (actual fraud) OR engaged in a transfer of property that wasn’t for a reasonably equivalent value when insolvent (constructive fraud)
* Governed by the UFTA and §548
* Note: trustee can choose to invoke UFTA (state law version) in bankruptcy case through §544(b)(1) so long as there IS a CR that would have the right to avoid any part of this transaction under applicable law. Trustee can then wipe out the entire transaction
  * Expands the state law power, which would be limited outside of bankruptcy to only the portion of the transaction that affects the individual CR who has the right
  * Ex: leveraged buy-out transaction – trustee could wipe out a $2M transaction based on a CR who has $2k stake in the transaction
  * Ex: Caesars restructuring before filing for bankruptcy – many of these restructuring arrangements
  * Ex: payments to executives just before bankruptcy (even those that are part of the employment contract) –AIG

## What Counts as a Fraudulent Conveyance

* Religious or Charitable Donations? Not necessarily
  * Religious or charitable donations are allowed so long as…
    * (1) Contribution does not exceed 15% of debtor’s gross annual income in the year the transfer was made OR
    * (2) If it is greater than 15%, the contribution is consistent with past practices
  * But payment of a “pledge” within 90 days may be avoided as a preference
* Excessive Compensation for Insider Employees? Yes
  * Can be avoided if…
    * (1) Employee’s services were not of reasonably equivalent value for the transfers/obligations AND
    * (2) Transfers were not made in “ordinary course of business”
  * Note: do NOT require a showing of insolvency for this to constitute a fraudulent conveyance
* Non-collusive foreclosure sales? NO! (BFP v. Resolution Trust)
  * Rule: Trustee cannot avoid foreclosure sale as constructive fraud regardless of the sales price as long as all state foreclosure procedures are followed
  * Note: BFP holding only covered mortgage foreclosure sales, but its rationale seems to reach forced sales, like forced public auctions of personal property as well.
* Ponzi schemes? Presumption of actual fraud
  * Definition of Ponzi scheme:
    * No real business to invest in, fake profits are reported and paid to early investors, inducing more investment from both new and old investors until the scheme collapses
    * Question becomes the extent to which those who received distributions pre-bankruptcy can be forced to give them back to the bankruptcy trustee. Issue arises with innocent victim/good faith recipients
  * Rule: All distributions to investors in such debtors are made with actual intent to hinder, delay, and defraud other creditors
D.	Fraudulent Conveyance HYPOS

HYPO1: Skeel owns a painting worth 500k. Skeel does not want CR to have it because they do not appreciate it. Goes to Vegas with the painting and casino will make him a loan on the spot in the back. Skeel gets 500k worth of chips. Plays and loses it all. Files for bankruptcy.

Is this a fraudulent conveyance?
* UFTA 4(a)(1) or §548(a)(1) argument for actual fraud
  * Skeel could counter by saying that he didn’t act intentionally with the purpose of stiffing the CRs, really thought he would win. Was not planning to not pay the CRs
* Argument for constructive fraud
  * This would apply if Skeel didn’t get reasonably equivalent value for it. Argument would be that the House has the odds in its favor in all games on the floor, which means that 500k worth of chips are actually worth less than the present value of the painting
    * House does not have the odds in its favor for games like poker, blackjack
  * Argument that it was reasonably equivalent value bc theoretically Skeel could just take the chips and cash out for the $500k value in full without playing at all. Also could argue that 80-90% of the value is reasonably equivalent. Skeel thinks this would be reasonably equivalent value

Suppose this really was a fraudulent conveyance (constructive fraud), would the casino have a defense?
* §548(c)—Good Faith Purchaser Defense.
  * Constructive fraud doesn’t necessarily get fully protected if acting in good faith – gets a lien on the value of what purchaser transferred
  * Casino would either (1) have a lien for the value of the painting or (2) keep the art but have to give the difference in value presuming it went up
* Note: UFTA gives a complete defense to a buyer that is acting in good faith (difference between UFTA and §548)

HYPO2 (p. 341-2):
DR is in financial trouble, gives property to good faith buyer for 80k bc he is willing to pay right away. Good faith buyer then sold this property to good faith purchaser for 120k.

DR files for bankruptcy and trustee wants to avoid this sale as a fraudulent conveyance. Can he?
* Under BFP could argue this was a distressed sale (like a foreclosure sale). The low price is not indicative of fraud based on the circumstances. But note that BFP is about foreclosure sales and this is not a true forced sale

If we determine that 80k is indicative of constructive fraud. What would happen?
* If the buyer acted in good faith, then the buyer would have a lien of 80k and would have to give back the difference in value between the price he paid (80k) and the true/appropriate value of the property
  * Note: if the court valued the property at 120k, the buyer would have to give back 40k. Would have an 80k lien.  (lien for purchase price, give back difference in value and purchase price OR painting itself)

Could trustee go after good faith purchaser (who got property from the good faith buyer who bought it from DR)? NO good faith purchaser is fully protected under §550(b)(2)

HYPO 3(not discussed in class):
Prior to BR, DR has an extravagant dinner for $10k. Can this be seen as a fraudulent conveyance?
* If trustee can show that the DR had intent to defraud, restaurant would have to return 10k and would then have a claim against the DR for 10k. BUT, 548(c) would provide the restaurant with a defense so long as it acted in good faith
