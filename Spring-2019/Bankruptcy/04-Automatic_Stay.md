# The Automatic Stay

## General Overview

* The automatic stay is a statutory injunction that takes effect when a BR petition is filed, regardless of whether it is voluntary or involuntary
* When debtor files for bankruptcy, all collection activities have to stop: aka creditors must stop seeking payments, suing debtor, etc
* Rationale:
  * Making bankruptcy process a collective action problem - if all creditors race to the court house, they won’t be able to save a business which may actually be worth saving from being dismembered
  * If there are lots of creditors, they may not all be able to coordinate/get together, so each creditor has an incentive to grab payment in full first

## Key Provisions

### §105: Discretionary Stay

* Provides additional authorization to the court to provide relief as appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
  * Example can be used to enjoin actions against the debtor or third-parties (Robins)
* This provision cannot be used to change/conflict with any other existing Code provisions
  * Ex: cannot stay the running of a statutory redemption period bc 108(b) covers this (Johnson) 

* Critical Vendor Doctrine
  * Permits repayment of vendors deemed to be critical to restructuring efforts
  * If supplier will walk away unless debtor pays back post-petition debts, then Courts allow debtor to unilaterally pay the supplier its unsecured claims to save the relationship during the bankruptcy proceeding

### §362(a): Proceedings that are Stayed

* §362(a)(1)
  * Commencement or continuation of litigation intended to recover pre-petition claims or those that was/could’ve been commenced before filing
    * Note: Pre-petition claims may include causes of action that have resulted from pre-BK conduct and post-petition legal relationships
    * Note: aimed at staying judicial or administrative proceedings
* §362(a)(2) -- Enforcement of a pre-petition judgment
  * Creditor cannot enforce a judgment obtained before bankruptcy
* §362(a)(3) -- Act to obtain possession of/exercise control of property of estate
  * Creditor cannot take any action to re-possess the property of the estate
    * Note: not limited to pre-petition obligations 
* §362(a)(4) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the estate
  * Note: not limited to pre-petition obligations
* §362(a)(5) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the debtor (when such lien secures a claim that arose pre-petition)
  * Property of the debtor: inclusion of (5) and use of this term suggests that it involves property that is not part of the estate
  * Examples: property acquired after bankruptcy (if in a chapter (Ch. 7) /jurisdiction does not include after-acquired assets in the estate) OR property that is exempted from the estate (sentimental value)
* §362(a)(6) -- Acts to collect, assess, or recover a claim against debtor that arose before commencement of case
  * Note: this can include irate phone calls harassing the debtor or even withholding future services because of a prior debt (Q5 (p. 163))
* §362(a)(7) -- Setoff (of mutual debts)
* §362(a)(8) --Commencement/continuation of Tax proceedings

### §362(b): Exceptions to the Stay

* **§362(b)(1)** -- Criminal suits (for true crimes, not ones that are simply seeking payment of a fine)
* **§362(b)(4)** -- Government exercising police/regulatory power** (Penn Terra, see below)
* **§362(b)(7/17/27) -- Exception for derivatives and other financial contracts**
  * **§362(b)(7) -- Repurchase Agreements**
    * Like a secured loan
    * Debtor sells securities to a lender/buyer in connection with contract
  * **§362(b)(17) –- Swaps**
    * Contract where you are swapping obligations
    * Ex: currency swap (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference in the two currencies); interest rate swap --one party promises to pay a fixed interest rate, other party promises to pay a variable interest rate (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference); credit default swap (key issue in 2008 financial crisis)?
    * **362(27) -- Netting arrangements**
    * Arguments for/against special treatment:
      * For Exception: this market can take care of itself (self-clearing market); domino effect failure; promotes liquidity in the system; protects hedges; otherwise would make these contracts undesirable
      * Against Exception: worry about race to the courthouse (makes bankruptcy useless for DR bc there is nothing the DR can do to protect itself from posting collateral for these contracts)
      * Skeel: the fact that these are volatile contracts, time-sensitive, and have the potential to leave non-debtors exposed are good reasons for the stay, but the stay should be very short 
362(c): Termination of the Stay in the event of repeated filings
•	§362(c)(3)— If debtor had a prior case dismissed in the preceding one-year period, the automatic stay in the second case terminates without respect to the debtor within 30 days after filing unless debtor rebuts heavy presumption that her case was not filed in good faith
•	§362(c)(3)-- If ∆ has two or more filings within the previous year, there is no stay at all unless bad faith presumption in preceding sentences is rebutted
362(d): Lifting the Stay 
•	§362(d)(1)— Cause /reason to lift the stay (mainly lack of protection)
o	Normally dealing with secured creditors whose collateral is deteriorating in value  
•	§362(d)(2)— For property…if the debtor has no equity in the property and the property is not necessary vital to reorganization efforts 
362(k)(1): Willful Violation  
•	An individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys fees, and where appropriate, punitive damages

## Hypotheticals

### Hypothetical 1 - Generic Example

* Setup (Practice Problem 3 on pg. 162): Creditor has gotten a judgment lien before bankruptcy. On July 1, debtor files for bankruptcy. On July 15, creditor gets a writ of execution
* Does obtaining the writ of execution violate §362 (automatic estate)? **YES! The violation can be classified under a series of different provisions within 362(a)**
  * **§362(a)(1)** -- The commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title
    * Could potentially argue this is continuation of the judgement or that execution is the commencement
  * **§362(a)(2)** -- Enforcement of a pre-petition judgment against the debtor
  * **§362(a)(3)** -- Act to obtain possession of/exercise control of property of estate
  * **§362(a)(4)** -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the estate
  * **§362(a)(5)** -- Any act to create, perfect, or enforce against any property of the debtor any lien to the extent that such lien secures a claim that arose before the commencement of a case under this title
    * Skeel - Having both (4) and (5) in the statute seems redundant. May be that (4) most naturally applies to liens that arise after bankruptcy filed; 5 focusing on property of debtor, 4 focusing on property of estate
  * **§362(a)(6)** -- Any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before commencement of the case
  * Note: Obtaining a writ of execution is NOT a ministerial function (which would be ok –Soares)

### Hypothetical 2 - Oil and Gas Company

* Setup: A law mandates that oil and gas company (DR) clean the land up after they cause wild fires. The EPA comes after them and they enter into a consent order in which the DR will: (1) rebuild 100 homes and (2) build a mini-museum on the land to talk about conservation and environmentalism. The DR takes its time fulfilling these obligations and the EPA approaches the AG, alleging that the DR entered the consent agreement fraudulently. The AG wants to pursue a fraud claim against the DR. The DR then enters bankruptcy
* Can the AG continue to pursue the fraud claim after the DR has filed for bankruptcy?
  * Yes.  This is a **criminal case and is excluded from the automatic stay under Section 362(b)(1)** – the only way a criminal action would violate the stay is if it looks like the government is actually just collecting a debt (under the guise of a criminal act)
* Can the EPA continue to pursue its claims after the bankruptcy filing?
  * Argument in favor of continuation:  This is **part of the regulatory power and exempt from the automatic stay under Section 362(b)(4)**
    * State exercise of police power is excepted – governmental units are allowed to bring legal action against the DR to stop violations of regulatory laws such as fraud and environmental protection laws
    * Could potentially even argue that museum is exercise of police powers as it promotes health, safety, and welfare of the state’s populace
  * Argument against continuation:  Although the fixing of the land/prevention of future erosion is probably within the EPA’s regulatory power, the museum requirement is outside the scope of the government’s regulatory powers and is actually just a money judgment
* The court ultimately held for the EPA – even though this is going to cost the company money, it does not qualify as simply enforcing a money judgment because the EPA is exercising its regulatory power.  However, the court notes that acts that seem like money judgments might be exempted from the automatic stay (it does not have to be actually asking for money).  This particular case was on the line
  * The **EPA is not acting like a regular CR when it is preventing future harm**
  * But if they are just trying to collect money to mend pre-petition harm the EPA looks a lot more like a CR

### Hypothetical 3 - Energy Holdings Company

* Energy holding company with subsidiaries in electricity, natural gas, and nuclear energy. For purposes of bankruptcy, treated as independent. Electric subsidiary borrows $500M from bank. Bank requires as part of loan:
  1. Electric Co must get insurance policy for top managers
  2. Loan must be guaranteed by the Holding Company
  3. Required to get a letter of credit, which will pay Bank if Electric Co fails to pay. Letter of Credit to be secured by assets of Electric Co.
     * (Letter of Credit = a promise by a 3rd party to pay a lender in the event debtor is unable to pay. Functions like a secured loan, except the one paying is not Debtor, but Letter of Credit Lender)
* If Electric Co files for Bankruptcy, are each of these 3 things subject to the stay? (Electric Co is in Bankruptcy; Holding Co and Gas Estate Co are NOT)
  1. Insurance policy
     * Cannot terminate because this would be taking equity away from estate 
     * If the insurance policy had a clause that said either party can terminate at any time with 30 days notice, can the insurance company terminate?
       * Courts have consistently held they can NOT. If policy is property of the estate, it is something valuable to estate. Terminating violates § 362(a)(3)
  2. Guarantee of loan by Holding Co
     * Can Bank sue Holding Co – or is that subject to stay?
     * This is ok. Not affecting property of the estate; Holding Co is a third party – Not part of the bankruptcy
     * Argument stay should apply - If Op Co and Holding Co have such a close relationship with each other, they are intertwined (i.e. Robins case). Posner opinion?
  3. Letter of Credit
     * Can Bank go after Letter of Credit lender?
       * Normal rule: An action against Letter of Credit lender is NOT stayed – they are 3rd party
          * Would not change amount of assets. Only creates a new claim
          * Policy argument: whole point of LOC is for it to be available when debtor can’t pay
       * Argument to preserve stay (weak)
          * Perfected security interest that LOC lender has on electric company assets upon failure to meet bank obligations effects the estate
     * Twist here: Security interest of LOC is in Electric Co’s assets!
       * However this does NOT change the analysis
       * The LOC Lender is secured creditor. Cannot take the assets, this will be stayed
       * Bank going after 3rd party is extraneous to estate. Entire purpose is to provide alternative means of ensuring payment upon failure to meet obligation
       * Why are we not worried that there is a new secured creditor here? Security interest was granted before the fact! LOC Lender is effectively a secured creditor from the start
     * **Basic Rule: The stay does not stop an action by the creditor, against the LOC Lender. LOC Lender is a 3rd party**
       * We are not worried about this “sudden security interest” in debtor’s assets by LOC Lender, because it is NOT sudden! It was always there, just became necessary when LOC was invoked. Action against property by LOC Lender would be stayed
