# The Automatic Stay

## General Overview

* The automatic stay is a statutory injunction that takes effect when a BR petition is filed, regardless of whether it is voluntary or involuntary
* When debtor files for bankruptcy, all collection activities have to stop: aka creditors must stop seeking payments, suing debtor, etc
* Rationale:
  * Making bankruptcy process a collective action problem - if all creditors race to the court house, they won’t be able to save a business which may actually be worth saving from being dismembered
  * If there are lots of creditors, they may not all be able to coordinate/get together, so each creditor has an incentive to grab payment in full first

## Key Provisions

### §105: Discretionary Stay

* Provides additional authorization to the court to provide relief as appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
  * Example can be used to enjoin actions against the debtor or third-parties (Robins)
* This provision cannot be used to change/conflict with any other existing Code provisions
  * Ex: cannot stay the running of a statutory redemption period bc 108(b) covers this (Johnson) 

* Critical Vendor Doctrine
  * Permits repayment of vendors deemed to be critical to restructuring efforts
  * If supplier will walk away unless debtor pays back post-petition debts, then Courts allow debtor to unilaterally pay the supplier its unsecured claims to save the relationship during the bankruptcy proceeding

### §362(a): Proceedings that are Stayed

* §362(a)(1)
  * Commencement or continuation of litigation intended to recover pre-petition claims or those that was/could’ve been commenced before filing
    * Note: Pre-petition claims may include causes of action that have resulted from pre-BK conduct and post-petition legal relationships
    * Note: aimed at staying judicial or administrative proceedings
* §362(a)(2) -- Enforcement of a pre-petition judgment
  * Creditor cannot enforce a judgment obtained before bankruptcy
* §362(a)(3) -- Act to obtain possession of/exercise control of property of estate
  * Creditor cannot take any action to re-possess the property of the estate
    * Note: not limited to pre-petition obligations 
* §362(a)(4) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the estate
  * Note: not limited to pre-petition obligations
* §362(a)(5) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the debtor (when such lien secures a claim that arose pre-petition)
  * Property of the debtor: inclusion of (5) and use of this term suggests that it involves property that is not part of the estate
  * Examples: property acquired after bankruptcy (if in a chapter (Ch. 7) /jurisdiction does not include after-acquired assets in the estate) OR property that is exempted from the estate (sentimental value)
* §362(a)(6) -- Acts to collect, assess, or recover a claim against debtor that arose before commencement of case
  * Note: this can include irate phone calls harassing the debtor or even withholding future services because of a prior debt (Q5 (p. 163))
* §362(a)(7) -- Setoff (of mutual debts)
* §362(a)(8) --Commencement/continuation of Tax proceedings

### §362(b): Exceptions to the Stay

* §362(b)(1) –criminal suits (for true crimes, not ones that are simply seeking payment of a fine)
* §362(b)(4) -- Government exercising police/regulatory power** (Penn Terra, see below)
* §362(b)(7); (17); (27)--Exception for derivatives and other financial contracts
  * §362(b)(7) -- Repurchase Agreements
    * Like a secured loan
    * Debtor sells securities to a lender/buyer in connection with contract
  * §362(b)(17) –- Swaps
    * Contract where you are swapping obligations
    * Ex: currency swap (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference in the two currencies); interest rate swap --one party promises to pay a fixed interest rate, other party promises to pay a variable interest rate (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference); credit default swap (key issue in 2008 financial crisis)?
    * 362(27) –netting arrangements  
o	Arguments for/against special treatment: 
	For Exception: this market can take care of itself (self-clearing market); domino effect failure; promotes liquidity in the system; protects hedges; otherwise would make these contracts undesirable 
	Against Exception: worry about race to the courthouse (makes bankruptcy useless for DR bc there is nothing the DR can do to protect itself from posting collateral for these contracts)
	Skeel: the fact that these are volatile contracts, time-sensitive, and have the potential to leave non-debtors exposed are good reasons for the stay, but the stay should be very short 
362(c): Termination of the Stay in the event of repeated filings
•	§362(c)(3)— If debtor had a prior case dismissed in the preceding one-year period, the automatic stay in the second case terminates without respect to the debtor within 30 days after filing unless debtor rebuts heavy presumption that her case was not filed in good faith
•	§362(c)(3)-- If ∆ has two or more filings within the previous year, there is no stay at all unless bad faith presumption in preceding sentences is rebutted
362(d): Lifting the Stay 
•	§362(d)(1)— Cause /reason to lift the stay (mainly lack of protection)
o	Normally dealing with secured creditors whose collateral is deteriorating in value  
•	§362(d)(2)— For property…if the debtor has no equity in the property and the property is not necessary vital to reorganization efforts 
362(k)(1): Willful Violation  
•	An individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys fees, and where appropriate, punitive damages
