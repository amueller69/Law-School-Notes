# The Automatic Stay

## General Overview

* The automatic stay is a statutory injunction that takes effect when a BR petition is filed, regardless of whether it is voluntary or involuntary
* When debtor files for bankruptcy, all collection activities have to stop: aka creditors must stop seeking payments, suing debtor, etc
* Rationale:
  * Making bankruptcy process a collective action problem - if all creditors race to the court house, they won’t be able to save a business which may actually be worth saving from being dismembered
  * If there are lots of creditors, they may not all be able to coordinate/get together, so each creditor has an incentive to grab payment in full first
* Aims of the Automatic Stay:
  * Debtor protection: Safeguard against dismembering the bankrupt’s estate by stopping collection efforts. Permits debtor to attempt repayment/reorganization plan
  * Creditor protection: Provide orderly liquidation procedure under which creditors are treated equality (no race against debtor’s property, ratable distribution)
* The automatic stay is backward looking and only applies to pre-petition debts, contracts, etc.  Any deal that is made after the petition is filed is not subject to bankruptcy restrictions
  * Even new deals can violate the automatic stay in certain situations
    * Example: The DR’s supplier (unsecured) says that he will only give the DR supplies if he pays pre-petition debt
    * Even though this takes place post-petition, it is still a collection effort that is stayed under the bankruptcy proceedings.  This violates 362(a)(6), which forbids acts to collect claim against debtor that arose before commencement of the case
* **Critical Vendor Doctrine**
  * Permits repayment of vendors deemed to be critical to restructuring efforts
  * If supplier will walk away unless debtor pays back post-petition debts, then Courts allow debtor to unilaterally pay the supplier its unsecured claims to save the relationship during the bankruptcy proceeding
    * Normally, you are not allowed to as it would unfairly privilege one creditor

## Key Provisions

### §105: Discretionary Stay

* "The court may issue any order, process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title"
* Provides additional authorization to the court to provide relief as appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
  * Example can be used to enjoin actions against the debtor or third-parties (Robins)
* This provision cannot be used to change/conflict with any other existing Code provisions
  * Ex: cannot stay the running of a statutory redemption period bc 108(b) covers this (Johnson)

### §362(a): Proceedings that are Stayed

* An injunction doesn’t need to be sought (it is automatic)
  * Notice is not required – all CRs are subject to the stay whether they have notice or not
  * When the DR files for bankruptcy she gives the court the names and addresses of her CRs and notice is sent to these addresses
    * Since a lot of DRs have “lockbox” addresses that they send their monthly bills to, many CRs have filed a “notice of address” with a bankruptcy court – all bankruptcy courts must then use this address to notify the CR.  If a CR has filed an address with a court, notice will not be considered “effective” until it has been sent to this address.
    * §342(g)(2) - No monetary penalty may be imposed on a CR for acts violating the stay committed before the CR is given effective notice
* §362(a)(1)
  * Commencement or continuation of litigation intended to recover pre-petition claims or those that was/could’ve been commenced before filing
    * Note: Pre-petition claims may include causes of action that have resulted from pre-BK conduct and post-petition legal relationships
    * Note: aimed at staying judicial or administrative proceedings
* §362(a)(2) -- Enforcement of a pre-petition judgment
  * Creditor cannot enforce a judgment obtained before bankruptcy
* §362(a)(3) -- Act to obtain possession of/exercise control of property of estate
  * Creditor cannot take any action to re-possess the property of the estate (Not limited to pre-petition obligations)
    * Example: D stops paying lease and files for BR. Landlord cannot terminate the lease and retake the property. It can only file for relief
    * Example: Insurance company cannot cancel policy
* §362(a)(4) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the estate (Not limited to pre-petition obligations)
  * Foreclosure is stayed
  * Acts of perfecting SC/mortgage are stayed
    * Exception under §362(b)(3), which incorporates exceptions from 546(b) (cases of automatic perfection-PMSI’s) and 547(e)(2)(A) (30 day grace period to perfect after transfer, aka the transfer date is the perfection date if perfected within 30 days)
* §362(a)(5) -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the debtor (when such lien secures a claim that arose pre-petition)
  * Property of the debtor: inclusion of (5) and use of this term suggests that it involves property that is not part of the estate
  * Example: Property acquired after bankruptcy (if in a chapter (Ch. 7) /jurisdiction does not include after-acquired assets in the estate) OR property that is exempted from the estate (sentimental value)
* §362(a)(6) -- Acts to collect, assess, or recover a claim against debtor that arose before commencement of case
  * Note: this can include irate phone calls harassing the debtor or even withholding future services because of a prior debt (Q5 (p. 163))
* §362(a)(7) -- Setoff (of mutual debts)
* §362(a)(8) -- Commencement/continuation of Tax proceedings

### §362(b): Exceptions to the Stay

* **§362(b)(1)** -- Criminal suits (for true crimes, not ones that are simply seeking payment of a fine)
* **§362(b)(2)** -- Cannot interfere with the rights of spouses and children to receive domestic payment from debtor spouses
* **§362(b)(4)** -- Government exercising police/regulatory power (Penn Terra, see below)
  * Requirements: (1) Actions must protect public welfare, and (2) Must be a nonmonetary judgment (or be forward looking)
  * But can’t enforce money judgment (exception to exception). Prevents gov’t units from using the police/regulatory power to gain preferential treatment over other creditors
    * “Money judgments” do not have to be literal money judgments – an act that is analogous to a money judgment will also be stayed
    * Rule: If the purpose is to remedy a backward-looking (past) harm, then it is a money judgment (not exempted). If the purpose is forward-looking (seeks to prevent future harm), then it falls under the regulatory power exception
    * Key question: does the regulatory agency look like a CR in this situation?
* **§362(b)(7/17/27) -- Exception for derivatives and other financial contracts**
  * Favors Wall Street for dealings with financial instruments like swaps and derivatives
  * **§362(b)(7) -- Repurchase Agreements**
    * Like a secured loan
    * Debtor sells securities to a lender/buyer in connection with contract
  * **§362(b)(17) –- Swaps**
    * Contract where you are swapping obligations
    * Ex: currency swap (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference in the two currencies); interest rate swap --one party promises to pay a fixed interest rate, other party promises to pay a variable interest rate (at the end of the period, contract would be worth the difference); credit default swap (key issue in 2008 financial crisis)?
    * **§362(27) -- Netting arrangements**
    * The exercise by a master netting agreement participant of any contractual right (as defined in section 555, 556, 559, or 560) under any security agreement
    * Arguments for/against special treatment:
      * For Exception: this market can take care of itself (self-clearing market); domino effect failure; promotes liquidity in the system; protects hedges; otherwise would make these contracts undesirable
      * Against Exception: Worry about race to the courthouse (makes bankruptcy useless for DR bc there is nothing the DR can do to protect itself from posting collateral for these contracts)
    * Skeel: The fact that these are volatile contracts, time-sensitive, and have the potential to leave non-debtors exposed are good reasons for the stay, but the stay should be very short

### §362(c): Termination of the Stay in the event of repeated filings

* Sections preventing abuse of repeated filings
* §362(c)(3) - If debtor had a prior case dismissed in the preceding one-year period, the automatic stay in the second case terminates without respect to the debtor within 30 days after filing unless debtor rebuts heavy presumption that her case was not filed in good faith
* §362(c)(4) - If D has two or more filings within the previous year, there is no stay at all unless bad faith presumption in preceding sentences is rebutted

### §362(d): Lifting the Stay

* §362(d)(1) -- Cause/reason to lift the stay (mainly lack of adequate protection)
  * Adequate protection means protection of value of a secured creditor’s collateral or mortgage holder’s collateral
  * Normally dealing with secured creditors whose collateral is deteriorating in value
* §362(d)(2)— For property…if the debtor has no equity in the property and the property is not necessary vital to reorganization efforts

### §362(k)(1): Willful Violation

* An individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys fees, and where appropriate, punitive damages

## Violations of the Automatic Stay

* If a creditor has done something that in form violates the automatic stay, it will be deemed a violation unless it is clear that the creditor acted without notice of the filing or the debtor acted in bad faith
* When there is a willful violation, the bankruptcy court is free to award the debtor actual damages (§362(k)(1))
* Void v. Voidable:
  * Void: act itself is no good/invalid (and must be undone somehow)
    * Void means it just doesn’t exist. It is impermissible, invalid from the get go
    * (Pro-debtor) likely to conclude the stay is violated bc the burden is on the creditor to validate the action
    * Court’s Definition: not permissible action. Strong presumption against the creditor
    * *Soares* court claims that actions in violation of the stay are presumptive void. The burden is on the creditor to show compelling reason for exception (lack of notice or debtor acted in bad faith). Bar is high
  * Voidable:
    * (Pro-creditor) likely to conclude the stay is not violated because the burden is on the debtor
* What would it take for creditor to get the stay to be retroactively lifted?
  * Showing of bad faith by debtor
  * Showing lack of notice to creditor

### In Re Soares

* Timeline:
  * March 22, 1995 – Creditor seeks order of default and judgment of foreclosure
  * March 24, 1995 — Debtor files for bankruptcy (automatic stay goes into effect)
  * April 10, 1995 – State court issues a default order
    * Note: This is the key moment
  * June 14, 1995 – creditor seeks relief from automatic stay and debtor's lawyer fails to contest
  * November 29, 1995 - foreclosure sale
* Issue: Were default order and foreclosure sale a violation of automatic stay?
  * Creditor's argument: the “real activity” (aka foreclosure) under state law, happened before debtor filed for bankruptcy, it happened on March 22 and the rest were ministerial actions (mistake of timing)
* Holding: The default order **violates the automatic stay because the actions after the bankruptcy filing were not “ministerial”** (ex. signed without any sort of judgment made, no discretion involved, but merely carrying out) but were core to the judicial proceedings. This was a violation of §362(a)(1) because it is a continuation of a judicial act
  * Issuing a default order is pretty pro-forma, but **it is not simply a ministerial function. It involves some discretion/involvement of the court**, and therefore it is violation of the automatic stay because the decision was made after the stay was in place
  * Court rejected the creditor’s §362(d) motion to lift the stay retroactively (although it established the fact that the court does have the power to do so when appropriate)
  * “The dead tree gives no shelter” – If the automatic stay is not interpreted vigorously, it won’t provide the role it’s supposed to, ie facilitating collective proceedings
    * Driving home importance of automatic stay. If not vigorously enforced, Bankruptcy will not be effective
* Take-Away: when a judgment has been obtained against the debtor pre-petition, ministerial acts done after the stay is in place (like entry on the docket, etc) will not violate the stay. Any act that carries out a core judicial function, even if minimal, is not considered ministerial and thus will violate the stay

## Limits on the Automatic Stay

* **§108(b)**: provides for automatic extension of deadlines for property rights of the estate and the like (60 day extension of timeline to cure default)
* **§362(a)**: Only stays affirmative actions, no matter how trivial. It CANNOT stay an automatic expiration (such as an automatically expiring equity period of redemption)
  * If any action were needed, even filing with real estate office, § 362 would presumably apply
  * Note: if there was a guarantor to this transaction, the stay would presumably not reach an action against the guarantor, the stay only reaches the debtor and the guarantor is in place precisely as an alternative means of repayment should the debtor be unable to repay
* **§105**: Powers can be used to filling in the gaps to afford the debtor maximum protection, but cannot be used to conflict/change an existing provisions
  * Ex: Since §108(b) provision extended the debtor’s time with respect to the equity period of redemption already, §105 powers could not be invoked to include the running of the statutory period in the automatic stay (Johnson)
* **Equity Periods of Redemption** - Buyback periods after foreclosure where DRs can redeem the property that they defaulted on.
  * §108(b): DR can redeem property until the end of the statutory period, or 60 days after the BR order of relief, whichever is longer. As long as the period had not already run
  * §105 can’t be used to expand the period (Johnson: When a provision of the Code provides clear guidance on how to handle a situation, bankruptcy courts cannot use their broad § 105 powers to contradict or undermine the Code)
  * §108(b) might not apply in situations like options to buy real estate – if a DR had an option to buy real estate that expired on 12/1 and he filed for bankruptcy on 11/1, conceivably he has until 1/1 (60 days after filing) to purchase the real estate
    * Skeel thinks that 108(b) might not apply in this type of case since the value (and price) of an option is dependent on its length/time period. Extending the option under 108(b) would drastically change its value. 108(b) is usually construed not to apply to option contracts because the nature of those instruments is that their price is heavily tied to their length, any change in length can drastically change the character of the contract. Problem p. 204.
  * Equity periods of redemption can either expire automatically (like in Johnson) or may require the mortgagee/CR to take some affirmative step to complete the transaction – for example, some statutes require the mortgagee to mail notifications of foreclosure to the DR’s other CRs after the statutory period has run.
    * When the automatic stay is in place, the CR cannot take the additional step without violating the stay.  So, even though the statutory period ran, the CR cannot actually effectuate the transfer until the stay has been lifted
      * This is relevant because the property would then be subject to the bankruptcy process (for example, the DR could keep it and pay the CR the value of its lien in a Chapter 11 reorganization)

### Johnson v. First National Bank (equity periods of redemption)

* Equity of redemption period - Statutory moratorium puts a certain time period in which the sale/foreclosure is uncertain. Allows the debtor to redeem property that they defaulted on
  * Here, the debtor has one year to pay up after the foreclosure sale to regain possession. Otherwise, ownership transfers
  * Note: these statutes were put in place after the Great Depression. Louisiana put in one of these provisions after Hurricane Katrina
* Facts: Debtors filed for bankruptcy 3 weeks before a 12-month statutory redemption period on their mortgage ended. At this point, had had already commenced foreclosure proceedings and purchased the property.
* Bankruptcy judge found that the debtors had substantial equity in the property that was the subject of foreclosure and tolled the statutory redemption period
* Issue: can bankruptcy court toll or suspend the running of a statutory redemption period created by state law (under broad §105 powers)?
* Holding: The debtor was not allowed to redeem property. The statutory period expired
  * The 60 day extension period (provided by §108(b)) had already run.
  * §362(a) does not stay this statutory redemption period bc this is not an affirmative act (simply a running of the time)
    * Note: would only do so if state law required affirmative action to be taken by creditor/third party in order to transfer full title to property upon expiration of statutory period (which some states do for title to actually transfer)
  * §105 (bankruptcy court’s wide discretion) does not apply here because 105 cannot be invoked when it would contradict another code provision
    * Two provisions cover this…
      * 362(a) indirectly by not including it in the activities that are stayed
      * 108(b) provides a specific extension period for various functions in the event of bankruptcy
* Note: There are generally two options in the event of an equity period of redemption
  1. Automatic running of the equity period of redemption (Johnson)
  2. Require the creditor/mortgagee to take some affirmative action in order to complete the transaction and effectuate the transfer
     *Note: in this case, the creditor cannot take the additional step required without violating the stay
* Hypothetical: same situation as *Johnson*, except different timeline
  * Timeline:
    * December 1: Bankruptcy
    * January 1: foreclosure sale
    * January 1/15: Debtor wants to redeem
  * Question: does the debtor have the right to redeem?
    * YES! Because within the 60-day extension time provided by §108(b)
  * Note: 108(b) is going to give a 60-day extension (gives the debtor breathing space on whether to cure or not cure)

## Exceptions to the Automatic Stay (§362(b))

* Limits the stay to enable favored creditors to proceed against debtors unhindered by the stay
* Includes: spouses/children in domestic support scenarios; Wall street; landlords who can continue eviction proceedings obtained before filing; government regulation

### Penn Terra (govt police/regulatory exception)

* Facts: Environmental harm case. Mining company damaged landscape. Entered into a consent decree (to come into compliance with regulations) with DEP, Later filed for Ch. 7 bankruptcy. DEP came after Penn Terra, compelling Penn Terra to comply with consent decree. Ultimately fighting over 14k, which would only be done for the precedential value
* Held: DEP’s action is NOT stayed. The decree is forward-looking and seeks to prevent future harm (directly protects public health and safety). Therefore it falls under the police/regulatory power exception and is exempted from the automatic stay.
  * Repairing the land is to prevent future erosion (in addition to fixing past harm) and therefore is not a money judgment.
  * Another award like building a museum would not fall into the police & regulatory power unless it directly protects public health/safety.
* Rule: an exercise of police power that is forward looking is NOT subject to the automatic stay
  * Penn Terra makes a distinction between forward-looking and backward-looking remedies in order to define what constitutes a “money judgment”
    * Fixing past harm -> stayed
    * Fixing future harm -> NOT stayed
* Note: Nothing prevents a government agency from obtaining a money judgment, simply stays the process of enforcement when bankruptcy is filed. Yet, it is possible that an order which requires the expenditure of money is not in fact a money judgment and can still be valid while the stay is in effect
  * Definition of a “money judgment” = adjudication of liability for a sum of money (can payment satisfy request)

## Application of Stay To Non-Debtor Entities

* Co-Defendants in Lawsuits
  * Rules:
    * §362(a) is applicable only to proceedings against the debtor, but §105(a) gives BK court broad authority to issue an order process … as necessary to carry out the provisions of the title
    * When a company that is defending litigation files for bankruptcy, the ongoing litigation is stayed.  Courts generally refuse to use their §105 power to stay litigation against the debtor’s solvent co-Ds.  See Lynch v. Johns-Mansville (asbestos litigation)
    * Litigation against non-debtors has been stayed in Chapter 11 cases to preserve D’s reorganization options
      * This exception normally occurs when there is an “unusual situations” in which the relationship of the debtor/third-party makes the debtor the “real” defendant (i.e., when a judgment against a third-party would effectively be a judgment against the debtor/the estate).  A.H. Robins v. Piccinin
  * *A.H. Robins Co. v. Piccinin*
    * Facts: The debtor was the subject of numerous suits for product liability.  The debtor filed bankruptcy and brought a motion for a declaratory judgment that the debtor’s product liability policy was an asset of the estate and that injunctive relief restraining actions against co-defendant.
    * Holding: whole litigation has to stop bc the parries are so clearly tied. Cannot go forward on suits against third parties (doctors; directors/officers)
    * Key Arguments for Extension of the Stay:
      1. Insurance policy is structured in a way that is zero-sum*
         * There is a fixed amount (ceiling) and anything that was paid out would reduce the amount available for creditors of Robins.
         * Skeel: this is a very strong argument for the application of the stay. This fits squarely in §362
            * Direct line into §362: §362(a)(3) applies directly because the insurance policy is for the company and the third parties. If you sue the third parties, you will be affecting the insurance policies, which will be affecting property of the estate. The actions against the third parties will so diminish the estate
      1. Indemnification Obligation – if the guarantor can turn around and sue the debtor in the event that the guarantor has to pay for debtor’s default. Robins had an obligation under state law to pay back any payouts from the doctors/directors
         * Question: does indemnification take property from the estate? §362 is really about the assets of the estate, rather the number of claims/assets per creditors
         * Skeel: indemnification argument seems dubious by itself. This is bc the claim is really the same, just the identity of the party being paid is different
      1. Managers are essential to the reorganization process and the litigation would be a distraction from the reorganization effort
         * Impact of letting the litigation go forward on the reorganization process (many of the key defendants were members of Robins and would not be able to focus on reorganization efforts)
         * Skeel: weak argument as well (esp. in light of Otero Mills)
  * *In re Minoco Group of Companies, Ltd.*
    * Facts: D owned insurance policies that covered claims by D&O for indemnification of legal expenses and judgments arising from their activities. 2 months after filing Ch. 11, insurers canceled the policies.
    * Holding: a violation of the automatic stay
    * Relying on *AH Piccinin*, Court held that there was no significant distinction b/w a liability policy that insures the D against claims by consumers and one that insures the D against claims by officers and directors. Both policies protect diminution of the value of the estate.
  * *Matter of Edgeworth*
    * Holding: insurance proceeds were not property of the estate b/c they were entirely payable to a P. Distinguished from Piccinin in which liability insurance proceeds would be exhausted by the claims of the many P if the proceeds were not marshaled in a BK proceeding.
* Third Parties Liable to Pay the Debtor’s Obligations
  * There are three consensual security devices that can be used to assure payment of a debt.
    1. The debtor can grant the creditor a security interest in property of the debtor.
    2. A third party can guarantee payment of the debt by either a personal guaranty or by providing collateral to secure payment of the debt
    3. The debtor can obtain a standby letter of credit from a bank for the benefit of the creditor
* Guarantors
  * Rules:
    * Creditors CAN go after guarantors when the automatic stay is in effect.  This is the entire point of guarantors/guaranteeing a loan!  By guaranteeing a loan, we are giving the creditor a place to go if the debtor can’t fulfill his obligations.  Credit Alliance Corp. v. Williams
      * After a guarantor pays the creditor, the guarantor has a claim against the debtor – so allowing personal guarantors doesn’t change the playing field all that much.  Now, instead of Creditor A (the bank) having a claim against the estate secured by a guarantee, Creditor B (guarantor) has an unsecured claim for the same amount against the debtor.
    * Exceptions:  Courts have extended the automatic stay to guarantors in certain unique, exceptional situations.
      * If enforcement of the judgment against the guarantor would irreparably harm the bankruptcy estate the automatic stay may extend to a guarantor (In re Otero Mills)
      * OR
      * If enforcement of the judgment against the guarantor would have a detrimental effect on the debtor’s reorganization plan (In the Matter of Supermercado Gamboa, Inc)
  * *Credit Alliance Corp. v. Williams*
    * Facts: CA holds a note issued by Penn Hook and guaranteed by Gary and Malcolm Williams.  CA sued PH and the guarantors.
    * Holding: § 362 only applies to debtor and property of the estate.  Guarantors of debtors in bankruptcy are not protected by the automatic stay. Only rarely is a proceeding stayed for a guarantor (“unusual circumstances”)
      * A guaranty does not provide an usual circumstance under Robins v. Piccinin.
  * *In re Otero Mills, Inc.*
    * Holding: The bank was enjoined from obtaining judgment from the guarantor of the debtor, its principal stockholder.
    * The court reasoned that it could enjoin such action under § 105(a) because the principal stockholder provides required assets for the reorganization.
    * Argument to be made: under certain circumstances where the third-party (owner/manager) is essential to the reorganization plan, the action against the third party may be stayed
      * Either they are putting up some of the money OR they will be distracted from the reorganization effort by the litigation
    * Note: this is a very controversial case that is not absolutely followed
  * *Matter of Supermercado Gamboa, Inc.*
    * The court stated that it would not follow the rationale of Otero unless there was a clear showing that the non-debtor guarantor would have detrimental impact on the debtor’s reorganization
  * Note: There is a debate as the extent injunctions are permissible to maintain a debtor’s ability to formulate a reorganization plan
* Letters of Credit Lender
  * Letter of credit
    * This obligates a bank to pay the creditor if certain conditions are met. This will give rise to a claim of the bank against the debtor.
    * Does an automatic stay prevent an action to collect from such a letter?  In re Page, the court on appeal answered no because although it creates indemnification claim it does not create, perfect, or enforce a lien in the property of the estate.
  * Rules:
    * The automatic stay does NOT extend to letters of credit
      * If the debtor has defaulted and is in bankruptcy, the creditor can enforce the letter of credit since the letter of credit is not property of the estate and it will not divest the estate of property.  (In re Page)
    * Note: Letters of credit are not subject to the automatic stay even if they are secured by property/collateral of the debtor. This is because the security interest was voluntarily provided pre-filing and thus there is no creation of a new claim (simply activation of a contingent claim). Any attempt to actually take the property of the debtor would be stayed, however
  * Note: there really is no difference between a letter of credit and a guarantor.
    * Skeel: a letter of credit is effectively a form of guarantee
* Insurance Contracts
  * ARE subject to the automatic stay
  * Insurance policies are assets/are part of the estate

### Relief from Automatic Stay for Cause (362(d))

* Considerations for lifting the stay:
  * Whether the issues in the pending litigation involve only state law, so the expertise of the bankruptcy court is unnecessary
  * Whether modifying the stay will promote judicial economy and whether there would be greater interference with the bankruptcy case if the stay were not lifted bc matters would have to be litigated in bankruptcy court
  * Whether the estate can be protected properly by a requirement that creditors seek enforcement of any judgment through the bankruptcy court

### *In re Holtkamp*

* Facts: There was a pending civil action (personal injury suit) initiated in 1979 and set for trial in 1980. Five days before trial was scheduled to begin, Debtor filed for Ch. 11 bankruptcy and claimed the personal injury claim as an unsecured debt.
* Holding: lifting the stay was proper
  * Allowing the suit to proceed merely determined debtor’s liability, but did not change the plaintiff’s status in relation to other creditors
  * Allowing the civil action to go forward did not jeopardize debtor’s estate bc his insurance co assumed full financial responsibility for defending that litigation
  * Interests of judicial economy bc the court date, witnesses, etc had already been scheduled
    * Skeel: from the bankruptcy court’s point of view, allowing the litigation to proceed is preferable bc it will just result in an unsecured claim (will determine liability but automatic stay will stop any enforcement of a judgment) and this way the bankruptcy court will not have to evaluate the value of the claim. It is especially persuasive bc the case was so close to a judgment already bc litigation is so far along already before filing
* Take-Away:
  * A desire to permit an action to proceed to completion in another tribunal may provide adequate cause for a 362(d) lifting of the automatic stay
  * Other causes may include the lack of any connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case

## Scope of the Automatic Stay - Hypotheticals

### Hypothetical 1 - Generic Example

* Setup (Practice Problem 3 on pg. 162): Creditor has gotten a judgment lien before bankruptcy. On July 1, debtor files for bankruptcy. On July 15, creditor gets a writ of execution
* Does obtaining the writ of execution violate §362 (automatic estate)? **YES! The violation can be classified under a series of different provisions within 362(a)**
  * **§362(a)(1)** -- The commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title
    * Could potentially argue this is continuation of the judgement or that execution is the commencement
  * **§362(a)(2)** -- Enforcement of a pre-petition judgment against the debtor
  * **§362(a)(3)** -- Act to obtain possession of/exercise control of property of estate
  * **§362(a)(4)** -- Creating/perfecting/enforcing a lien against property of the estate
  * **§362(a)(5)** -- Any act to create, perfect, or enforce against any property of the debtor any lien to the extent that such lien secures a claim that arose before the commencement of a case under this title
    * Skeel - Having both (4) and (5) in the statute seems redundant. May be that (4) most naturally applies to liens that arise after bankruptcy filed; 5 focusing on property of debtor, 4 focusing on property of estate
  * **§362(a)(6)** -- Any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before commencement of the case
  * Note: Obtaining a writ of execution is NOT a ministerial function (which would be ok –Soares)

### Hypothetical 2 - Oil and Gas Company

* Setup: A law mandates that oil and gas company (DR) clean the land up after they cause wild fires. The EPA comes after them and they enter into a consent order in which the DR will: (1) rebuild 100 homes and (2) build a mini-museum on the land to talk about conservation and environmentalism. The DR takes its time fulfilling these obligations and the EPA approaches the AG, alleging that the DR entered the consent agreement fraudulently. The AG wants to pursue a fraud claim against the DR. The DR then enters bankruptcy
* Can the AG continue to pursue the fraud claim after the DR has filed for bankruptcy?
  * Yes.  This is a **criminal case and is excluded from the automatic stay under Section 362(b)(1)** – the only way a criminal action would violate the stay is if it looks like the government is actually just collecting a debt (under the guise of a criminal act)
* Can the EPA continue to pursue its claims after the bankruptcy filing?
  * Argument in favor of continuation:  This is **part of the regulatory power and exempt from the automatic stay under Section 362(b)(4)**
    * State exercise of police power is excepted – governmental units are allowed to bring legal action against the DR to stop violations of regulatory laws such as fraud and environmental protection laws
    * Could potentially even argue that museum is exercise of police powers as it promotes health, safety, and welfare of the state’s populace
  * Argument against continuation:  Although the fixing of the land/prevention of future erosion is probably within the EPA’s regulatory power, the museum requirement is outside the scope of the government’s regulatory powers and is actually just a money judgment
* The court ultimately held for the EPA – even though this is going to cost the company money, it does not qualify as simply enforcing a money judgment because the EPA is exercising its regulatory power.  However, the court notes that acts that seem like money judgments might be exempted from the automatic stay (it does not have to be actually asking for money).  This particular case was on the line
  * The **EPA is not acting like a regular CR when it is preventing future harm**
  * But if they are just trying to collect money to mend pre-petition harm the EPA looks a lot more like a CR

### Hypothetical 3 - Energy Holdings Company

* Energy holding company with subsidiaries in electricity, natural gas, and nuclear energy. For purposes of bankruptcy, treated as independent. Electric subsidiary borrows $500M from bank. Bank requires as part of loan:
  1. Electric Co must get insurance policy for top managers
  2. Loan must be guaranteed by the Holding Company
  3. Required to get a letter of credit, which will pay Bank if Electric Co fails to pay. Letter of Credit to be secured by assets of Electric Co.
     * (Letter of Credit = a promise by a 3rd party to pay a lender in the event debtor is unable to pay. Functions like a secured loan, except the one paying is not Debtor, but Letter of Credit Lender)
* If Electric Co files for Bankruptcy, are each of these 3 things subject to the stay? (Electric Co is in Bankruptcy; Holding Co and Gas Estate Co are NOT)
  1. Insurance policy
     * Cannot terminate because this would be taking equity away from estate
     * If the insurance policy had a clause that said either party can terminate at any time with 30 days notice, can the insurance company terminate?
       * Courts have consistently held they can NOT. If policy is property of the estate, it is something valuable to estate. Terminating violates § 362(a)(3)
  2. Guarantee of loan by Holding Co
     * Can Bank sue Holding Co – or is that subject to stay?
     * This is ok. Not affecting property of the estate; Holding Co is a third party – Not part of the bankruptcy
     * Argument stay should apply - If Op Co and Holding Co have such a close relationship with each other, they are intertwined (i.e. Robins case). Posner opinion?
  3. Letter of Credit
     * Can Bank go after Letter of Credit lender?
       * Normal rule: An action against Letter of Credit lender is NOT stayed – they are 3rd party
          * Would not change amount of assets. Only creates a new claim
          * Policy argument: whole point of LOC is for it to be available when debtor can’t pay
       * Argument to preserve stay (weak)
          * Perfected security interest that LOC lender has on electric company assets upon failure to meet bank obligations effects the estate
     * Twist here: Security interest of LOC is in Electric Co’s assets!
       * However this does NOT change the analysis
       * The LOC Lender is secured creditor. Cannot take the assets, this will be stayed
       * Bank going after 3rd party is extraneous to estate. Entire purpose is to provide alternative means of ensuring payment upon failure to meet obligation
       * Why are we not worried that there is a new secured creditor here? Security interest was granted before the fact! LOC Lender is effectively a secured creditor from the start
     * **Basic Rule: The stay does not stop an action by the creditor, against the LOC Lender. LOC Lender is a 3rd party**
       * We are not worried about this “sudden security interest” in debtor’s assets by LOC Lender, because it is NOT sudden! It was always there, just became necessary when LOC was invoked. Action against property by LOC Lender would be stayed

### Hypothetical 4 - Bank

* Setup: Bank made an unsecured loan to debtor (500k) and the bank requires that the debtor do its banking with the Bank as a condition (unsecured loan agreement). Debtor has 100k in working capital in a savings account with the Bank. Debtor owes the bank 500k.
* Can the Bank take money from the debtor’s bank account (exercise its set-off right under state law)? NO! violation of the automatic stay
  * §362(a)(7)-- Setoff (of mutual debts)
* Can the Bank freeze the debtor’s account? Technically, YES!! (Scalia’s decision in Strumpf)
  * Argument that freezing the account is a shield rather than a sword. Actions that are a sword (affirmatively doing something) would be a violation of the automatic stay
  * Note: Skeel does not necessarily think this view is a good reading. Could use §362(a)(7) because freezing the account is simply a backhanded way at achieving a set-off OR §362(a)(3) because it is an attempt to exercise control over property of the estate
