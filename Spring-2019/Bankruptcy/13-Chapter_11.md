# Chapter 11 -Corporate Reorganization

## Key Provisions

* **§1104(a) - Allows for appointment of a Trustee if necessary in Ch. 11 case**

* **§1104(c) - Examiners**

* **§1102 - Creditor’s Committee**

### §1107 - Debtor-in-Possession

* Subject to any limitations of trustee, debtor in possession shall have all the rights (except that to compensation) and powers to perform all functions and duties of the trustee
  * D.I.P. financing agreements of contracts have emerged and curtailed the freedoms that debtor of a possession has

### §1121 - Proposing the Plan (DIP exclusive agenda control for at least first 120 days)

* For the first 120 days, only DR may file a plan. If DR files a plan within 120 days of filing for bankruptcy, DR has 60 additional days (ending 180 days from filing petition) to obtain acceptance of the plan
* §1121(d) -- Court can reduce/increase these periods, but exclusive periods cannot be extended beyond 18 months (for 120 day period) and 20 months (for 60 day period)

### §1122 - Classification of Claims

* DR may classify CR into classes, which function as voting units
* Important because voting on acceptance/rejection of plan is done by classes
* Requirements:
  * Claims/interests may be placed in a class only if such claim/interest is “substantially similar” to other claims/interests of the class
    * Substantially Similar: includes equal priority rank in liquidation
  * All claims/interests in a class must be treated alike
* US Trucking: some differences between CRs treated equally can warrant classification in different classes
* Greystone: DR cannot strategically classify classes just to gerrymander an affirmative vote on a reorganization plan

### §1126(c) - Voting on a Ch. 11 Plan

* A class of claims has accepted a plan if such plan has been accepted by…
  * (1) Creditors that hold at least 2/3rd  in amounts AND
  * (2) Represent more than ½ the number of the allowed claims of such class held by CRs that have accepted or rejected such plan
* Note: only impaired classes vote. Unimpaired classes are deemed to accept plan
* Figter: a CR with multiple claims gets to vote his claims independently (e.g. if have two claims, have two votes)

### §1124(1) - “Impairment” (could mean CRs receiving less than amount of their claim; getting different value for their claim -like shares/stock in reorganized company instead of money)

* Note: important because only impaired classes vote. Unimpaired classes are deemed to accept plan.
* Broad definition, which includes almost all claims/interests in chapter 11 reorganization
* “Impairment is present UNLESS plan leaves unaltered rights of holder”
* Only NOT impaired if rights are (1) unaltered or (2) there is a cure for DR’s default
  * “Cure”--Cash payments may not be considered a cure if under the terms of the agreement the CR was going to receive payments over a period of time with interest. Arguably a CR paid in full under Ch. 11 would still be an impaired class because under loan agreement would have received more (i.e. would’ve received the interest also)
  * Skeel: for our purposes assume that a CR that is paid in full in cash is NOT impaired even though some of the caselaw says otherwise

### §1126(e) - Disqualification of Votes for Plan

* Designate = disqualify
* Allows court to disqualify vote accepting or rejecting plan that was not done in good faith after a motion by party, notice, and a hearing
* What counts as bad faith/ulterior motive?
  * Buying blocking position in several classes to prevent confirmation of a compelling plan
  * Attempt to get more than CR rightly deserves (obtain benefits they are not entitled to)
  * Attempt to block plan in favor of their own competing plan
* Note: CR not necessarily acting in bad faith if motivated by desire to protect their own interests (Figter)

### §1129(a) - Consensual Plan

* §1129(a)(3) - Good Faith Requirement
  * Note: CR acting self-interestedly to preserve his claim is not necessarily acting in “bad faith.” Only reaches level of bad faith when CR is demanding things he is not entitled to

* §1129(a)(7) - Best Interest Test
  * If a plan is approved by all impaired classes of claims/interests in §1126(c) and (d), dissenting members of each class are bound so long as they best interest test is met
  * Best Interest Test Analysis: dissenters must receive at least as much as they would have received under a Chapter 7 liquidation plan

* §1129(a)(8) - Requirement that all classes have to vote yes

* §1129(a)(10) - If any impaired classes of CRs, at least one impaired class has to vote yes
  * Note: this requirement doesn’t matter for an (a) -consensual plan because you also still have (a)(8) requirement that ALL classes vote yes. This matters for a cramdown/non-consensual plan because no matter when, there still must be at least ONE impaired class that votes yes to confirm a plan

* §1129(a)(11)-Feasibility requirement for the plan

### §1129(b) -- Non-Consensual Plan [Cramdown]

* Have to meet all requirements of §1129(a) EXCEPT (a)(8)-unanimous voting requirement
  * (a)(3) - Good Faith Requirement
  * (a)(7) - Best Interest Test
  * (a)(10) - If any impaired classes of CRs, at least one impaired class has to vote yes
    * Note: An impaired class that contains an insider is ineligible to satisfy this requirement. An impaired class of “interests” also does not count (e.g. class of stockholders)
  * (a)(11)-Feasibility requirement for the plan

* Cannot discriminating unfairly
  * I.e. cannot treat one class differently than another even though they are comparable
  * Basic rules: similarly situated CR must receive similar treatment; all claims classified together must be treated alike; laws against treating any particular CRs poorly

* Absolute Priority Rule
  * If a class objects, cannot give anything to lower down groups
  * Negative implication that parties can agree to take less than entitled to
* Note: there was a cramdown in the Detroit bankruptcy and people weren’t happy. Argument that the plan discriminated unfairly because it gave pension-holders more than similarly situated CRs

### §1129(b)(2)(B) - Absolute Priority Rule

* If class of unsecured CRs objects, lower classes get NOTHING
* This rule bars junior interest holder’s receipt of any property on account of his prior interest
  * Normally dealing with shareholders who get value in reorganized company based on prior position as shareholder
* Note: some jurisdictions follow the new value exception, whereby existing equity holders can retain equity in reorganized company by having their equity interest valued and contributing this amount of cash to DR for use under plan

* §363(c)(1) - Sale/Lease of Property In Ordinary Course
  * Debtor-in-possession may sell/lease property of estate without court approval if done in the ordinary course of DR’s business (without notice to CRs or court authorization)
    * Allows DR in business of selling goods/leasing equipment may continue to operate after filing
    * Should allow DR to continue selling/leasing on same terms it employed before filing OR same terms generally followed in the industry

* §363(b)(1) - Going Concern Sales under §363
  * If debtor-in-possession wants to sell/lease property of estate “other than in the ordinary course of business,” it can do so after notice and a hearing
  * E.g. Chrysler case

## Key Players in Chapter 11 Case

* Debtor-In-Possession (§1107)
  * Has trustee powers, like avoiding preferential transfers or fraudulent transfers it made as a DR before bankruptcy
    * Premised on assurance that the officers and managing employees can be relied on to carry out fiduciary responsibilities of the trustee
  * Does NOT investigate its own past conduct
  * Only one who can propose a reorganization plan within the first 120 days of the case (gives the managers agenda control for at least the first 4 months of the case and potentially for longer. Capped at 18 months)

* Trustee (§1104(a))
  * A trustee is only appointed in Ch. 11 case if absolutely necessary. This occurs in exceptional cases when there has been cause (including fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, gross mismanagement of affairs by current management)
  * Appointment is done by US Trustee unless trustee is elected by creditors but a 20% vote
  * Can appoint trustee if it is in the best interests of CRs, estate, etc.
  * Can appoint trustee instead of dismissing a case

* Examiner (§1104(c))
  * Instead of appointing a trustee in chapter 11 case, courts may appoint an examiner who is seen as a middle ground
  * Role/Duties:
    * Can be limited to investigation powers or expanded to include almost all functions of trustee
    * Generally would look for preferences, fraudulent conveyances, accounting inconsistencies, look into behavior of high level officials
  * Examiner can be appointed on request of a party if…
    * (1) Appointment is in the interests of CRs, any security holders, or the estate OR
    * (2) Unsecured non-trade and non-insider claims exceed $5M
    * May be appointed when negotiations between parties reach an impasse

* Creditor’s Committee (§1102)
  * Generally comprised of persons holding the 7 largest unsecured claims
  * Act as primary negotiating body for reorganization effort
  * Powers of Creditor’s Committee:
    * Serve as a voice for unsecured CRs
    * Negotiate with debtor-in-possession about terms of reorganization plan
    * Propose rival plan (after DR exhausts his statutory exclusivity period)
    * Carry out investigations of DR’s financial condition
    * Can prosecute estate causes of action
    * Can employ professionals to carry out these functions
  * Note: fees incurred would be expenses of administration

## Proposing/Accepting the Chapter 11 Reorganization Plan

### Two ways for Ch 11 plan to be approved

* (1) Consensual Plan (§1129(a))
  * §1129(a)(3) - Good Faith Requirement
    * Note: CR acting self-interestedly to preserve his claim is not necessarily acting in “bad faith.” Only reaches level of bad faith when CR is demanding things he is not entitled to
  * §1129(a)(7) - Best Interest Test
    * If a plan is approved by all impaired classes of claims/interests in §1126(c) and (d), dissenting members of each class are bound so long as they best interest test is met
    * Best Interest Test Analysis: dissenters must receive at least as much as they would have received under a Chapter 7 liquidation plan
  * §1129(a)(8) - Requirement that all classes have to vote yes
  * §1129(a)(10) - If any impaired classes of CRs, at least one impaired class has to vote yes
    * Note: this requirement doesn’t matter for an (a) -consensual plan because you also still have (a)(8) requirement that ALL classes vote yes. This matters for a cramdown/non-consensual plan because no matter when, there still must be at least ONE impaired class that votes yes to confirm a plan
  * §1129(a)(11)-Feasibility requirement for the plan

* (2) Non-Consensual Plan (§1129(b)) (Cramdown)
  * Have to meet all requirements of §1129(a) EXCEPT (a)(8)-unanimous voting requirement
  * §1129(a)(3) - Good Faith Requirement
  * §1129(a)(7) - Best Interest Test
  * §1129(a)(10) - If any impaired classes of CRs, at least one impaired class has to vote yes
    * Note: An impaired class that contains an insider is ineligible to satisfy this requirement. An impaired class of “interests” also does not count (e.g. class of stockholders)
  * §1129(a)(11) - Feasibility requirement for the plan
  * Cannot discriminating unfairly
    * I.e. cannot treat one class differently than another even though they are comparable
  * Absolute Priority Rule
    * If an unsecured class of creditors objects, cannot give anything to lower down groups
    * If a class is not paid in full, junior creditors cannot receive anything (stockholder interests are always junior to any class of claims)
    * Shareholders are not allowed to keep their equity interest in reorganized Ch. 11 unless unsecured CRs class consents (§1129(a)) OR is paid in full over the life of the plan
    * This is because priority rules designate unsecured CRs above equity holders
    * Incentive for DR who wants to allow continued equity participation to offer plan that unsecured creditor classes will accept
    * Negative implication that parties can agree to take less than entitled to
  * §1129(b)(2)(B)(iii) - bars junior interest holder’s receipt of any property on account of his prior interest

### Possible Objections CRs Could Raise to Ch. 11 Plan

1. Plan doesn’t satisfy the §1129(a) requirements or §1129(b) requirements for confirmation
2. Best interest of CRs problem
   * Note: any objecting creditor can raise best interest objection even if their class as a whole votes yes to the plan
3. Good faith problem
4. Feasibility Issue
   * Note: feasibility becomes an issue when company is not writing down their debts enough (aka coming out of bankruptcy with too much debt)
5. Classification of CRs problem
6. Violation of absolute priority rule

### Who is Eligible to Vote for Proposed Ch. 11 Plan?

* Impaired classes only (for Skeel’s purposes NOT classes that are paid in full in cash)
* CRs can buy/sell claims and then have number of votes that corresponds to number of claims CR holds
  
* *In Re Figter Limited*
  * Facts:
    * DR: Figter (apartment complex)
    * CR: Teachers (secured CRs who thought it was partially unsecured)
    * DR proposed a plan Teachers did not like. Teachers bought 21 of 23 unsecured claims in Class 3 to vote down plan. Already was the only CR in Class 1.
  * Arguments:
    1. Teachers should be disqualified from voting in Class 3 because acted in bad faith
    2. Even if Teachers acted in good faith, it cannot vote on 21 claims separately
  * Holding:
    * Teachers acted in good faith. Acted to protect its genuinely believed valid interest as CR. Not ulterior motive
    * Teachers could vote each of its 21 claims separately because §1126(c) talks in terms of number of claims not number of CRs

### Business Justification Test - Second Guessing DR’s Classification of Creditors (*US Truck* / *Greystone*)

* Limitations on DR’s Ability To Classify Similar Claims Differently:
  * DR cannot classify similar claims separately just to gerrymander the vote and ensure an impaired class will vote yes [Greystone]
  * DR can classify similar claims separately if there are legitimate business justifications for doing so [Greystone]
    * DR can classify similar claims separately if groups of claimants have significantly different non-creditor interests that might affect their votes [US Trucks]

* *In Re US Truck Co*
  * Facts: CRs (Teamsters) argue DR does not meet requirements for plan acceptance because DR improperly classified claims by not putting T’s claim in same class as others with similar interest. Contend DR did this strategically so that it would have at least one class of impaired creditors’ approval of plan
  * Issue: can a DR keep a CR from joining a class of similarly situated CRs?
  * Holding: there were some differences between Teamsters’ claim and others in desired class making classification DR chose appropriate

* *Matter of Greystone III Joint Venture*
  * Facts: Single asset real estate case. CR (Phoenix) is under-secured. DR classified Phoenix’s deficiency claim in separate class from other trade unsecured claims to make sure it could use cramdown powers (secure one impaired class’s approval)
  * Holding: cannot classify similar claims differently in order to ensure an affirmative vote on a reorganization plan
  * Note: tenants were not an impaired class (could not actually vote) because DR assumed their leases, which meant that they did not hold “claims” against DR (only would hold claims against DR if DR rejected their leases)
  * Skeel: this doesn’t tell us specifically what is ok, just says that there are some limits on DR’s ability to separate CRs into classes

### Absolute Priority Rule (§1129(b)(2)(B))

* Each member of a senior class of claims/interests must receive full compensation before members of a junior class or equity holders could receive anything
  * Note: if class of impaired CRs (those who technically receive something different than what they bargained for) is paid in full, class will not have an absolute priority rule violation
* Absolute priority rule applies in Ch. 11 to a class of claims/interests that rejects the plan
* What does the absolute priority mean for shareholders?
  * Shareholders are not allowed to keep their equity interest in reorganized Ch. 11 unless unsecured CRs class consents (§1129(a)) OR is paid in full over the life of the plan
  * This is because priority rules designate unsecured CRs above equity holders

* New Value Exception To Absolute Priority Rule:
  * New value exception allows existing equity holders to retain or buy back their equity in the DR by having the equity interest valued and contributing this amount of cash to DR to be used under the DR’s plan
  
* Three Main Approaches
  * Reinhardt Approach
    * Old owners can retain interest in reorganized entity IF…
      * Owner makes a capital contribution that is new, substantial, money/money’s worth, necessary for successful reorganization, reasonably equivalent to the value of interest received
      * DR’s plan may give old owners exclusive right to purchase ownership interest in new entity
  * Easterbrook Approach
    * Leaves the question to CRs. When there is value to be gained by allowing a lower class to kick in new value and keep its interest, the CRs should be willing to go along with it
  * *Bank of America v. 203 North LaSalle*
    * Issue: whether a DR’s pre-bankruptcy equity holders may, over the objection of a senior class of impaired CRs, contribute new capital and receive ownership interests in reorganized entity?
    * Holding: cannot provide equity holders with exclusive opportunity free from competition and without benefit of market valuation
    * §1129(b)(2)(B)(iii) - bars junior interest holder’s receipt of any property on account of his prior interest
    * Note: seems to take market test view (like Reinhardt except no exclusive right to purchase equity in new entity)

## §363 Sales - Possible Alternative to Full CH. 11 Reorganization

### §363(c)(1) -Sale/Lease of Property In Ordinary Course

* Debtor-in-possession may sell/lease property of estate without court approval if done in the ordinary course of DR’s business (without notice to CRs or court authorization)
  * Allows DR in business of selling goods/leasing equipment may continue to operate after filing
  * Should allow DR to continue selling/leasing on same terms it employed before filing OR same terms generally followed in the industry

### §363(b)(1) - Going Concern Sales under §363

* If debtor-in-possession wants to sell/lease property of estate “other than in the ordinary course of business,” it can do so after notice and a hearing
* Common approach now. Beauty of these sales is that you can fix the financial distress situation quickly and easily without going through the whole confirmation of a plan mess
* E.g. Chrysler case

* *In Re Chrysler* (2nd Cir)
  * §363(b) sale OK even if DR selling all assets so long as “good business reason” for doing so
  * Facts: Old Chrysler wanted to sell all assets to New Chrysler (set up for this) for $2B.
  * Complaint: Circumventing reorganization through this sale /sub rosa plan of reorganization
    * Looks like a violation of absolute priority rule - higher priority CRs were owed 6.9B and got 2B and unsecured creditors got paid a lot more; suppliers were paid in full, retired union members got paid in full
    * Other argument - unfair discrimination (some unsecured claims get paid a lot others don’t); response to this: payment was being made by New Chrysler, not Old Chrysler and this doesn’t affect the value that was given
      * If Chrysler was worth over 2B, the value that was given because of this organization would have been different
  * Bankruptcy court granted motion to sell substantially all of DR’s (Chrysler’s) assets under §363(b)
  * Holding: §363(b) sale is ok even though it involved substantially all of DR’s assets
  * Satisfies “good business reason” requirement-- with its revenues were sinking, factories dark, massive debts growing, Chrysler fits within the melting ice cube standard

* *Lionell* - Business Justification for §363(b) Sale
  * Says there must be a business justification to go through a 363 sale rather than Ch. 11 reorganization
  * “Melting ice cube” argument - idea that if we don’t act quickly, the value will evaporate almost immediately (need to sell now because value is deteriorating rapidly and do not have time to wait for a full reorganization)

* *Braniff* - §363(b) Sale **Cannot** Be Used When Sub Rosa Plan Of Reorganization
  * Sub rosa plan of reorganization = disguised reorganization plan
  * Skeel: even though the second cir gave short change to this argument in Chrysler, Skeel thinks this is a sub rosa problem. Looks like a disguised reorganization plan. Why?
    * Part of the plan involved New Chrysler taking on some of Old Chrysler’s debts and agreeing to pay some of the unsecured CRs
      * E.g. VEBA 55%, $4.6B/Trade CRs $5.3B
    * Would have an absolute priority rule problem -Argument that it is really a reorganization plan because $2B sales price is going to the senior lienholders (secured CRs) while the other CRs (even unsecured CRs) are getting close to being paid in full.
  * Argument against sub rosa plan: this is a sale and $2B is really what the assets are worth. Further argument is that New Chrysler is free to do whatever they want so long as the $2B is a fair price. Can take on debts and it has nothing to do with the sale. Since there was a good business reason for the sale it is ok (court’s reasoning)

## Chapter 11 Summary HYPO

* Setup:
  * The Debtor has assets worth somewhere between $1000 and $3000. Debtor has three creditors: Bank, whom Debtor owes $1000, and who holds a perfected security interest in Debtor's equipment, which is worth $1000 at all relevant times; Union, whom Debtor owes $500; and Supplier, whom Debtor also owes $500
  * Debtor proposes a reorganization plan that classifies the parties as follows:
    * Class 1:  This class consists of the Bank. Bank's $1000 loan to Debtor will be reinstated under the plan, all defaults will be cured, and the bank will retain its security interest in Debtor's equipment
    * Class 2: This class consists of both Union and Supplier
      * Each will receive 500 shares of stock in the reorganized debtor.
      * Note: since stock is different than what CRs went in with, they are still considered impaired even though technically it looks equal (gave $500 and get 500 shares)
    * Class 3:  This class consists of the Debtor, who is the sole shareholder of Debtor
      * Debtor will retain 1000 shares in the firm after it is reorganized.

### Question One: If Bank and Union (and Debtor) favor the plan, but Supplier is unhappy with it, can the plan be confirmed over Supplier's objection? What objections could Supplier raise to the plan?

* Fail §1129(a)(8) requirement that every class of CRs must vote yes for a consensual plan
  * §1126(c) says that in order for a class to vote in the affirmative for a proposed plan, (2) more than 1/2  of number of CRs in the class AND (2) at least 2/3 in amounts of claims must vote yes.
  * Here, the Supplier is ½ of the CRs in the class and holds ½ of the amount of claims in that class. Thus, because of the Supplier’s opposition, Class 2 will not vote in favor of the plan. This precludes a unanimous vote
* Fails cramdown option in §1129(b) because no class of impaired CRs is voting yes. In this case, only Class 2 and Class 3 are impaired. Class 2 is going to vote not and Class 3 is ineligible to count as the one impaired class voting for the plan because the DR is an insider.
* Might have a best interest of CRs problem, but we would need to know what the business is worth/what a liquidation would bring and we don’t really know enough
* Might have a Good faith problem - probably IS in good faith. Hard to rebut
* Feasibility requirement problem - probably not. Since the value of the assets is btw 1-3k and Bank is owed only 1k, this plan is likely feasible.
  * Note: feasibility becomes an issue when company is not writing down their debts enough (aka coming out of bankruptcy with too much debt)
* Could make a classification argument - say it was inappropriate to create classes this way because a supplier and union are a little bit different by nature

* Answer: **This plan fails**

* Modification 1 - Suppose the DR proposes paying the Bank 1k in cash
  * Note: this potentially helps get the plan confirmed under the §1129(b) -cramdown option. Why? Because Class 1 (Bank) could be seen as an impaired class that is now eligible to vote on the plan. This is a very creative way for DR to get an impaired class to vote yes so the plan could be confirmed.
  * Skeel: we are going to assume that if a CR is paid in full, they are NOT impaired. Assume that even when a claim is bifurcated into a secured claim and unsecured claim (at least assume it is unimpaired for the secured portion of the claim).

* Modification 2 - Suppose the Supplier is indifferent to the plan. Hedge fund comes around and wants to buy claims (wants to purchase distressed debt strategically)
  * What should the hedge fund do?
    * Might want to buy enough claims to force a unanimous vote yes for a favorable plan. At a minimum, would want to buy at least 334 shares because then the hedge fund would have veto power over a consensual plan it didn’t like (334 shares is a little over 1/3 of the amount of claims so couldn’t get the 2/3 vote required for an affirmative vote).
      * Note: court can disqualify votes under §1126(e) if it seems like they are just buying a blocking position. Hedge fund would need to be careful. Buying debt in bankruptcy is fine, but it is not fine to buy just to blow up a favorable plan.
    * Hedge fund wants to target the fulcrum class - the highest priority unsecured class that is NOT getting paid in full. If CRs are paid in full, they are not impaired and cannot vote so hedge fund’s desire to buy debt to control reorganization plan will be futile

* Modification 3: Suppose hedge fund buys 5 claims from suppliers (only 5 supplier claims) and half of the Union claim. Now have 750 out of 1000 in amount
  * Does hedge fund have control over Class 2? YES, could guarantee a vote/confirmation of plan under §1129(b) cramdown option because because now hedge fund would have a majority in number and over 2/3 in amount
  * When hedge fund buys five of the supplier claims, that is five claims (and five votes), not one. Focus is on number of claims, not claim holders
  * Note: It is claims, not claim-holders, that is important in voting context (§1126; *Figter*)

### Question 2: If Debtor amends the reorganization plan, and puts Union and Supplier in separate classes (but does not otherwise change their treatment-- ie, each still would receive 500 shares of stock in the reorganized debtor), could the amended plan be confirmed over Supplier's objection

* Amended re-org plan
  * Class 1: Bank (loan repaid)
  * Class 2: Union (500 shares)
  * Class 3: Supplier (500 shares)
  * Class 4: DR (1000 shares)

* Why might a DR do this?
  * If DR knew that the Suppliers would reject the plan and the Union would vote in favor of it, might separate the two to ensure that at least one impaired class of CRs votes yes and satisfy §1129(b) -cramdown option

* What would be the Supplier’s objections?
  * Improper classification - unclear
    * Could say that the union and suppliers can be separated even though they are treated the same because they have different interests. Union comprised of employees who arguably have a greater interest in the reorganization of the corporation than suppliers (US Truck-DR’s classification of CRs is ok it makes sense/there is a business justification)
    * Could say that DR cannot classify just to gerrymander vote (Greystone - cannot separate unsecured CR and Bank’s deficiency claim which are treated the same just to get a favorable class vote)
    * Note: this classification looks odd if trying to argue Class 3 /4 are different kinds of creditors because they are given the same treatment. DR could signal a difference between the two groups of CRs by giving them different treatment. YET, this may raise a disco problem (discriminating unfairly).
  * Absolute priority rule problem --
    * Absolute priority rule: if class of CRs objects, cannot give any classes below the objecting CRs anything
    * Here, it might be a problem that Class 4 (DR who is given 1000 shares) gets anything because Suppliers (in Class 3) objected
    * But, this scenario might fit into the new value exception to the absolute priority rule
      * If DR gave new money, may be able to retain shares despite a seeming absolute priority violation. SCOTUS never said for sure that the new value rule was legitimate. OK based on market test (if there was an auction). Might be OK if DR waived exclusivity (aka others had an opportunity to put up the new value)
    * Note: only way this scenario would not violate absolute priority rule without new value exception is if the above classes were being paid in full
      * So, Supplier would have to be paid in full ($500). 500 shares would have to be $500. Possible only if the value of this company is at the high end of the range because have 2,000 shares and 1k payment required
    * Wouldn’t ask this q: Does this plan violate the absolute priority rule? Value of company is somewhere between1K and 3K dollars, but if DR is worth anything less than 3K, this wouldn’t satisfy absolute priority rule; would only satisfy the absolute priority rule if supplier was paid in full; if assets were worth 3K, Union and Supplier would be paid in full (even though Supplier’s class is voting no, they’re being paid in full)
      * Absolute priority rule: if a class votes no, either it has to be paid in full or nobody beneath it can get anything
    * If the supplier had 5x $100 claims, the hedgefund would want to purchase at least 4 of them in order to get the 2/3 of the amount of the total claims (would count as 4 claims not 1 bundled claim, under Figter)

* Suppose DR promises a cash contribution of $250 to the reorganization in exchange for keeping half of its stock (*La Salle*)  - new value exception
* Needs to be some sort of market test - hard to know if what DR is contributing is equitable, which is why this requirement exists
  * Two ways to satisfy (with some uncertainty)
    * Let other people bid on the stocks
    * If debtor waived exclusivity, the prospect of competing plans might justify a new value contribution
