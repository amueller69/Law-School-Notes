# Claims

## Key Provisions

### §101 - Definitions

* §101(10) – **Definition of Creditor**
  * An entity holding a claim that arose before filing petition in a voluntary case OR before the order of relief in an involuntary case
  * Skeel: to be a creditor in a bankruptcy case, you have to have a claim that arose before the order of relief. Definition of creditor is where we get the distinction between pre and post bankruptcy. Technically, the person owed money for post-petition activity is NOT a creditor, but rather the holder of an administrative expense (e.g. BR counsel)

* §101(5) – **Definition of Claim**
  * Broad interpretation - Can be contingent
    * Purpose of broad definition is because framers of BR code wanted to ensure all possible issues against DR are brought into BR so they could be addressed through the collective process and allow DR to leave without overhanging/encumbering issues. This is consistent with both fresh start and creditor's bargain theories
    * There are certain situation where having a claim would be undesirable for CR, such as when DR is re-organizing and CR would be able to get full dollar value for their claim if they waited until after BR to bring a suit
  * Any right to payment whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured
  * Includes right to equitable remedy for breach of performance if breach would give rise to a right to payment (see equitable remedy section below)

### §501 – Gate Keeping Provision (“A creditor may file a claim”)

* Enables creditor's to submit proof of a claim - controls who gets a piece of the pie and how big
  * If creditor doesn't file proof of claim in timely manner, trustee or debtor may file such a claim (§501(c))
  * §501(d) outlines what is needed in order to have a valid claim

### §524(g) – Future Asbestos Claims (Mansville trusts)

* Enjoins future claimants from pursuing the assets of a debtor who has already been through bankruptcy, so long as the debtor forms a trust pursuant to its plan of reorganization that assumes the liabilities of the debtor for these personal injury/wrongful death/property damage actions resulting from the manufacture of asbestos

### §502 — Determining The Value Of A Claim

* **§502(b)** – Determines who has claim, who doesn't, and to what extent
  * Court is charged with determining the amount of an unsecured claim
    * Fixed amount claims: Bankruptcy court does not have to do anything unless the value of the claim is contested
      * However, §502(a) allows interested parties to object to claim
    * Otherwise, court must conduct a summary hearing to determine the validity and amount of the claim
      * Allows the court to fix the amount of the claim as of the date of filing the petition
  * **§502(b)(2)** - Matured/accrued interest IS included in the value of the claim (un-matured interest NOT)
    * Claim for principal + accrued interest up unitl filing date but NOT unaccrued interest
  * **§502(b)(6)** - Restriction on real estate leases
    * The claim is limited to the greater of (1) 1 year of rent OR (2) 15% of the remaining rent on the lease, not to exceed three years of the remaining term
  
* **§502(c) – Pending cases**
  * Bankruptcy court can estimate (i.e. put a tentative amount on) the amount of contingent/unliquidated claims where liquidating or fixing them would unduly delay the BR case
    * Courts typically do this when BR judge does not have authority to decide the claim
    * Example: Court can only estimate personal injury claims (cannot fix them)
  * Also estimates any right to payment arising from a right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance.
* With a contractual obligation, the claim is generally for the amount of the contract (although there is no statutory support for this)

### §506 – Secured Claims

* **§506(a) – Scope of a secured claim**
  * Secured creditor has a claim up to the value of the collateral
  * Undersecured creditor (claim > collateral) will have a secured claim in the amount of the collateral’s value + unsecured claim for the rest (bifurcates undersecured creditor’s claim)
  * Value to be determined by court in light of purpose
    * **Rash analysis** – Foreclosure v. replacement value **depends on what debtor intends to do with property**
  * **§506(a)(2)** – Waives Rash in Chapter 7, 13 involving individuals when dealing with personal property (non-real estate)
    * > Value with respect to personal property securing an allowed claim shall be determined based on the replacement value of such property as of the date of the filing of the petition without deduction for costs of sale or marketing
      * Personal Property = anything except real estate if the debtor is an **individual**
      * Note: Does not matter what the debtor intends to use the property for
    * If consumer good (goods a debtor would use for personal household needs), replacement value is defined in a very specific way (“price a retain merchant would charge for property of that kind considering the age and condition of the property at the time value is determined”)
    * Note: This is because individuals are allowed to redeem consumer goods if debtor can cough up the value of the property in cash in full (722). §506(a)(2) defines what §722 value means
  
* **§506(b) – Interest To Oversecured Creditors** (up to amount of value of collateral)
  * > To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which...is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges
  * Note: applied to voluntary and involuntary over-collateralized creditors. Thus, IRS (secured creditor via a statutory lien) can also obtain interest
  * Under-collateralized creditors CANNOT receive interest (or payment for delay of enforcement of states rights) (Timbers)
  
* **§506(d) – Avoiding Liens**
  * Natural reading of §506(d)
    * > To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void, unless…
    * Such claim was disallowed only under §502(b)(5) - domestic support claim, or §502(e) - certain claims for reimbursement/contribution OR
    * Such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of an entity to file a proof of such claim under §501
    * Under non-Dewsnup approach, traditionally, §506(d) was interpreted to permit debtors to “strip down” secured claims to the value of collateral (assuming a claim was over-secured) in certain situations and void the unsecured portion.
  * Dewsnup Reading – Only if the claim is not allowed (illegitimate), then it is void. Does **not** void a lien in excess of the amount at which the court valued the secured claim
    * Ex: If Bank’s loan was fraudulent -> Bank would have no claim
    * Supreme Court read (§506(d)) in a tortured way. Why? Because they interpreted the history to suggest that a lien rides through bankruptcy (bankruptcy discharges debtor’s personal liability but not the in rem liability)
    * Note: this does not get applied in Ch. 11 or 13, just used in Ch. 7. Would cause major problems in application in 11 or 13 and negatively impact the reorganization efforts

## Claims in General (Unsecured Creditors)

* Types of Claims
  1. Secured
  1. Priority – unsecured claims that are given priority over others (ex: DSOs)
  1. Unsecured – creditors get a pro-rata share of the estate

### Filing of Claims

* Chapter 7:
  * Claim has to be filed within 90 days of the date set for the date set for the first meeting of creditors
    * Meeting of creditors: meeting of creditors that the court is not allowed to come to, creditors are able to ask questions to the debtor. It is not a violation of the automatic stay for the creditors to yell at the debtor
* Chapter 11:
  * No absolute rule on relevant date (bar date)
  * Bar date is whatever the date the court sets
  * Exception: if the debtor lists you and the amount you are owed, you are ok and do not need to file a claim.
  * Basically lose the claim if you fail to file by the bar date (unless there is excusable neglect)
    * Excusable Neglect: it might be excusable that a creditor does not file a claim if he never received notice

### Who Has A Valid Claim

* Rule: Need conduct + relationship prior to BR in order to have a claim
  * Relationship defined as when the creditor comes in contact with the DR in whatever gave interaction rise to the claim
  * Note: We do not want the definition of claim to be too limited because we want to pull as many claims into bankruptcy as we can. A pure conduct claim, however, would open the floodgates. Piper adds relationship to conduct requirement, meeting somewhere in the middle
    * Example: Nuclear power plant explodes and energy company files for BR. However, people don't experience effects of radiation exposure until several years later. If pre-filing conduct is all that is needed, victims claim would have been discharged
  * Note: If don't have a claim under the rule, possible to bring it post-BR since it isn't discharged
* **Piper Test:**
  * **(1) Pre-Petition Conduct of Debtor**
    * Conduct has to be before bankruptcy filing or confirmation
    * Conduct: injury, design, manufacture, sold, etc
  * **(2) Relationship must be established before confirmation**
* Note: whether a creditor wants to have a claim depends on the chapter debtor has filed under. If it is a chapter 7 case, creditor want to have a claim because otherwise you do not get anything. If it is a chapter 11 (reorganization) case, creditor might not want a claim, but instead want everyone else to have a claim and you not to have a claim. This is because then you could potentially get 100-cents on the dollar from the post-reorganization debtor post-bankruptcy. The debtor, however, wants everything to be considered a claim so that it can be discharged in bankruptcy

### *In re Piper Aircraft*

* Test: Pre-petition conduct + relationship pre-confirmation
* Facts: Piper has faulty aircrafts and has been defendant in several law suits for damages arising out of these defects. It iles for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Appointed legal representative fields proof of claim on behalf of future claimants for $100MM
* Issue: Do future claimants (those presently unknown individuals who may be injured in the future) hold claims against debtor within the meaning of §101(5)?
* Holding: No. Conduct + Relationship both needed
  * Here, there is no pre-petition exposure to specific defective products; no pre-confirmation relationship between debtor/future claimants.
  * Since there was no way of determining who these future parties would be, these future claimants did NOT have a claim in Piper’s bankruptcy case and thus could not be discharged
* Rule: In order for a claim to fit within §101(5), **the events that caused the injury must occur pre-petition and must create some type of relationship between the claimant and the debtor’s product. This relationship must be with an identifiable claimant or group of claimants and the basis of the claim must be the debtor’s pre-petition conduct in designing, manufacturing, and selling the allegedly defective or dangerous product**
* Question: What if Piper filed for bankruptcy after one accident knowing that there are thousands of bad planes?
  * Under Chapter 7 – Piper would get a windfall (because of liquidation)
  * Under Chapter 11 – Piper would not get off free because future victims don't have dischargeable claims and would be able to sue after bankruptcy (because of reorganization)
  * Piper was a bit of a hybrid since they filed for Chapter 11, yet opted for the liquidation plan so it resembled Chapter 7
    * Successor Liability - After sale is clear of liability, a claimant cn nonetheless argue that the buyer is responsible for the claim because it's a continuation of the same business
* Posner Note case (*Fogel*):
  * Concrete manufacturer sold defective concrete to Denver airport. Manufacturer files for Chapter 11 after it had been sued by 8 different purchasers. Airport did not file claim before the deadline. Pipes exploded and airport wants to bring suit.
  * Issue: Did they have a claim that was discharged at the time of confirmation?
  * Under Piper test, they had a claim, but they missed their chance. Conduct would be defined really broadly (i.e. when the concrete was installed, not when the injury ocurred)
  * The *Fogel* Court: finds no claim not because of a precise rule surrounding conduct and relationship, but due to the circumstances of the tort in that case
  * Posner: thinks it is crazy to call this a claim
    * Posner advocates a reasonableness test (cost/efficacy of providing notice)
      * **Reasonableness test**: Bearing in mind cost and efficacy of providing notice perhaps long before any tort claim arose. If it would be unrealistic to take account of these kinds of claims, it is not really a claim
      * Is it reasonable to expect the creditor to know it had a claim by the time of the bar date or confirmation (whichever is earlier)? In *Fogel*, Posner concluded it would not be reasonable to expect this
    * "It may not be possible to say anything more precise than that if it is reasonable to do so, bearing in mind the cost and efficacy of notice to potential future claimants and the feasibility of estimating the value of their claims before any harm giving rise to a tort claim has occurred, the bankruptcy court can bring those claimants into the bankruptcy proceeding and make provision for them in the final decree."
  * It would be unfair to say that all possible future-claimants have claims that are discharged in bankruptcy (because those claimants would be deprived recovery) = not fair. This is an adjustment of *Piper* test
  * Skeel: Easier way to get to Posner’s result = due process argument (no notice/no reason for the creditor to know of the filing).
    * To deal with this fact, you tend to get national notice to cut this argument off

### Hypothetical Based on *Piper*

* Debtor is a manufacturer of planes
* Timeline:
  * 12/1: 2 pilots buy planes
  * 1/1: Debtor files for bankruptcy (Ch. 11)
  * 2/1: Pilot #1 and customer crash
  * 3/1: Chapter 11 plan is confirmed
  * 4/1: Pilot #2 and customer #2 crash
* Question: Which of these individuals have claims in bankruptcy case?
  * Rule: Need pre-petition conduct AND pre-confirmation relationship in order to have a claim
  * Pilot #1: Yes - has a claim
    * There is pre-petition conduct (pre-petition manufacturing of the plan)
    * There is a pre-petition relationship (pre-petition buying the plane on 12/1, connecting pilot to manufacturer)
  * Customer #1: Yes - has a claim
    * There is pre-petition conduct (pre-petition manufacturing of the plan)
    * There is a pre-petition relationship (buying the ticket to go on the plane, connecting pilot to manufacturer)
  * Pilot #2: Yes - has a claim, but it is discharged
    * There is pre-petition conduct (manufacture, sale, etc)
    * There is a pre-confirmation relationship (buying the plane on 12/1)
    * There is a potential due process issue here if Pilot #2 did not have notice
      * Would violate DPC if potential claimant did not have notice of the BR proceedings and and the proceedings discharged his claim
        * What counts as notice? Direct notice, for one. Newspaper publication of notice is usually enough to give potential claimants notice as well
        * Even if Pilot #2 had been given notice, should we have expected him to make his claim? This would depend partially on the expectation of injury. Why would he make a claim if he never expected to be injured?
  * Customer #2: No - does not have a claim
    * There is pre-petition conduct
    * The relationship was post-petition (UNLESS he bought the ticket before 3/1, his connection to the debtor/manufacturer occurred after the 3/1 confirmation date)
* Adjusted Hypo: If pilots don’t buy plane
  * Pilot #1 still has relationship because flew plane before Ch. 11 confirmation

### Mass Future Claims in Bankruptcy - §524(g) (Asbestos Cases)

* Johns-Manville - Early case where company had huge tort exposure. Even people who were exposed to asbestos before BR might not experience effects for several decades (due process issue)
  * Holding: Asbestos claims were technically pre-petition claims because the asbestos causing the injuries was manufactured pre-petition even though some of the individuals who later suffered from diseases did not have any symptoms at the time of bankruptcy. However, court did not decide who had claims
  * Instead, it set up a channeling trust, put aside most of the value of the company (50-60% of the stock of the re-organized company). Put in place a channeling injunction that said that no matter when the harm arises, you can only exercise the claim against the trust, not against the re-organized company. Ensured due process through a future claimant’s representative
  * Constitutionality of this trust was initially questioned, so Manville went to congress who then enacted §524(g)
* §524(g) – Future asbestos claims
  * Enjoins future claimants from pursuing the assets of a debtor who has already been through bankruptcy, so long as the debtor forms a trust pursuant to its plan of reorganization that assumes the liabilities of the debtor for these personal injury/wrongful death/property damage actions resulting from the manufacture of asbestos
  * Requirements:
    * **§524(g) only applies to asbestos-cases**
    * Trust has to:
      * (1) Own a majority of the stock in the re-organized company;
      * (2) Claimants who do exist have to approve the proposed plan by 75% (higher than average—idea being that many people will not actually be part of the vote);
      * (3) There has to be a representative of the future victims (future claimants’ representative)
  * If you put together a trust that looks like the Manville trust, it has been treated as legitimate. Trust has been used in a number of cases/even non-asbestos cases although there has been no decision on the Constitutionality of it
    * Assumed these trusts are ok, that they satisfy due process although it has never been actually decided

### Equitable Rights - When are equitable rights considered claims within the meaning of §101(5)

* **General Rule**: Equitable rights are claims within the meaning of §101(5) when breach of performance triggers an equitable remedy AND an alternative right to payment (i.e. choice between equitable and monetary damages)
  * Specific performance generally treated as a claim because there may be an alternative right to payment
  * Covenants-not-to-compete are questionable depending on how they are structured/whether the court adopts the Udell or Ward approach
* **Specific Performance**:
  * If the creditor could insist on specific performance outside of bankruptcy, there can be an argument for no claim (e.g. Real estate sales - Often the theory is that land is so unique that monetary damages are insufficient to remedy the breach)
* **Covenants Not To Compete**:
  * Courts are hesitant to allow injunctions enforcing non-complete covenants to be stayed in bankruptcy even though the underlying breach of K gives rise to money damages
* **Udell Approach** (majority, pro-creditor view) – Depends on whose choice it is:
  * **If creditor's choice -> No claim** (i.e. if  debtor can't force creditor to tke money damages outside of BR, then there is no claim)
  * **If debtor's choice ->  Claim** (i.e. if debtor can force creditor to take money damages, then there is claim. Debtor would always chose monetary damages since unsecured claim is less burdensome than post-BR enforceable injunction)
  * **If no choice -> No claim**
  * Udell court looks to see whose choice it is to determine whether the covenant can be considered a claim
    * If the creditor gets the choice of which to take (monetary damages/injunction), it is not a claim if the creditor doesn’t want monetary damages
      * In other words, if the creditor could get a court to force the debtor to comply with injunction, then no claim
    * If the debtor could force the creditor to take monetary damages outside of bankruptcy (in other words, if the creditor could NOT insist on the injunction), then it is a claim
      * Example: 3rd Circuit case involving a Continental/United merger. As part of the collective bargaining agreement, pilots of Continental had a provision that if there was any merger, their seniority rights would be honored. During the merger, they realized that it would be impossible to honor seniority rights. Question was whether seniority rights could be converted into damages? Looked to state law for guiding principle. Under PA state law, court would award damages for a refusal to honor this principle, so this would be a claim
      * Note: this shows that there is an option for the debtor to force the creditor to take monetary damages
    * Pro-creditor: This is in line with the Butner principle (attempts to mirror non-bankruptcy law). The state law of covenants-not-to-compete already wrestles with issues of fresh start, so it is not that this law ignores the debtor’s needs
    * Skeel: Endorses this approach
* **Ward Approach** (minority, pro-debtor view) – If there is A choice, almost always considered a claim
  * If anyone (debtor/creditor) has a choice of monetary damages outside of bankruptcy, it is a claim (almost always a claim)
  * When does debtor have the option?
    * Statute allowing option of turning injunction into monetary damages
    * Common law rule allowing option of turning injunction into monetary damages
  * If there is an alternative to equitable relief, then there is a claim that can be discharged
    * Possibility of money damages is sufficient to constitute a claim. The only exception is if it is too speculative
  * Only time there would NOT be a claim is when there is no choice to get monetary damages
  * Pro-debtor: this is in line with a strong fresh-start policy

### Non-Compete Covenant Hypothetical

* Setup - Debtor is a mid-level employee at Target. As part of his employment contract, there is a covenant not to compete – debtor is not permitted to work at another retail store within 25 miles of a Target store for 5 years if he is fired or leaves voluntarily. If debtor breaches covenant, Target can get an injunction to prevent debtor from working at other retailer and for every month of violation, debtor has to pay $25k/month. Debtor quits Target, goes to work at Walmart. Target finds out after debtor has been violating it for two months and goes after debtor. Gets an injunction and then the debtor files for bankruptcy.
* Issue - Debtor wants to get rid of the injunction in bankruptcy. Can he?
* Debtor’s Arguments:
  * Consistent with Fresh start policy view of bankruptcy - Target is ubiquitous. Seems impossible for him to get a job
  * Is this enforceable covenant-not-to-compete under state law? Assume it is enforceable
    * This is somewhat debatable even in a state that enforces these covenants. States typically have common-law restrictions (“reasonableness”—duration, geographical regions, etc.) Too wide and too long here
    * CA does not enforce covenants-not-to-compete; really helpful for an emerging industry if people can move around a lot (in this case, end of story)
  * Argument that this is equitable relief that gives right to payment so it is a claim in bankruptcy under §101(5) that can be discharged
    * Yet, this looks like *Udell* covenant, where the injunction is NOT a claim because the creditor is entitled to BOTH money and the injunction under the covenant (one is not a substitute for the other)
* Target’s Arguments:
  * They can get remedy AND the injunction too because they can’t get the injunction immediately and so the remedy would provide for this lost time and attorney fees
* Assume the contract is enforceable:
  * *Udell*: Who has the choice outside Bankruptcy?
    * **If the creditor gets the choice to choose between money damages or injunction (the debtor cannot force the creditor to take money damages outside of bankruptcy) --> No claim**
    * **If the debtor could choose outside of Bankruptcy - to force creditor to take money damages --> There is a claim**
  * Under *Ward*, if there is a possibility of money damages, it is a claim
    * Only not a claim if the creditor would not be entitled to monetary damages (if damages too speculative - unlikely to happen)
  * On the other hand, Posner in *Apex*: Nobody has a right to money judgement, so the non-debtor's only choice is to get injunction for SP of the remedy. Therefore, it is not a claim; it is only equitable relief
  * Skeel: Dollar sign and injunction doesn’t necessarily make this a claim. Dollar sign would be a claim if it was serving as a replacement for the injunction
* Note: This is essentially the same issue as Penn Terra (does this violate the stay?)
  * Only if it is a claim - otherwise injunction won't be discharged

* Recap
  * 99% of the time, creditors do have claims. The 1% of times there isn’t a claim is in cases like:
    * Piper – when creditors have not been hurt yet, so their potential future claims are not valid claims in bankruptcy
    * Udell/Ward – if outside of bankruptcy, obligations would give rise to specific performance

* Other remarks:
  * Widely held view: the non-enforcement of covenants not to compete is one reason Silicon Valley took off
  * Seniority Respecting Provision in a Contract:
  * Continental merges with United; United refused to honor the continental airlines pilots’ seniority rights
  * The question: whether the K could be rejected, and if it was, whether the seniority rights could be converted into damages
    * 3rd circuit did a Udell-like decision: asked, under PA law – could the debtor refuse to accept the seniority rights and the non-debtor get money damages?
    * Looked at state law, under that state law the non-debtor would NOT be able to insist on SP. So the court awarded damages.

### Environmental Claims

* *United States v. Apex Oil*
  * Facts: debtor oil company has an injunction against it requiring it to clean up contaminated sites. Company will have to hire an independent contractor to do the work (cost 150M)
  * Issue: does the government have a claim that is dischargeable in bankruptcy because of the injunction?
  * Holding: NO. The cost incurred by debtor carrying out an equitable decree is NOT a “right to payment” making an injunction a disposable claim under §101(5)
  * Note: a claim is dischargeable only when the holder of the equitable claim (here, the injunction) could obtain monetary damages instead of the injunction/in the event that the injunction cannot be obtained otherwise (here applies a Ward analysis but says there is no claim)
  * Posner’s approach: Does NOT take a side on the Udell/Ward. Simply says government's injunction would NOT be a claim because only equitable relief is available. There is no monetary damages option. Non-debtor’s only choice is to obtain an injunction calling for specific performance
  * Kovacs case is a problem here
    * Kovacs allows something that looks like solely injunctive relief to be a claim
* Question: How does this issue (is this a claim?) fit with Penn Terra issue (is this a violation of the stay?)
  * Same legal issue – is this part of the bankruptcy process?
    * If this is a claim, it will also be subject to the automatic stay
    * If this is NOT a claim, it will NOT be subject to the automatic stay/NOT going to be discharged in bankruptcy
  * Is the government acting like an ordinary creditor or is it doing something else?
    * If fixing pre-existing harm…govt looks like an ordinary creditor
    * If fixing future problems….govt does NOT look like an ordinary creditor (doesn’t look like the sort of thing we are going to deal with in bankruptcy and so it does not seem to be a claim that would be dischargeable in bankruptcy)

### Hypotheticals Determining The Amount of An Unsecured Claim - §502(b)

* Hypothetical 1:
  * Setup - Bank makes a loan to debtor in the amount of 1M. Ten-year loan, 100k/year, 5% interest rate. After one year, DR pays nothing and files for bankruptcy. What is the value of the claim?
  * Claim = 1M (principal) + 50k (matured interest)
    * Debtor still owes the whole thing. Effectively bankruptcy accelerates the loan + interest that has accrued at the time of bankruptcy
  * Rule: **A claim is in the amount of the entire principal + interest that has come due already**
    * §502(b) makes it clear that un-matured interest is not part of the creditor’s claim
  * Question: how are Banks getting around this rule?
    * Make-whole payment requirement – Lending contracts often have penalty provision - if you default, you must pay it. Looks like un-matured interest (interest remaining on the loan)

* Hypothetical 2:
  * Contract in which manufacturer sells machine (equipment) to the debtor. Unsecured agreement. Sale on credit situation. Sales contract arrangement is $100k payment each year for 7 years. After one year (before making first 100k payment), the debtor files for bankruptcy.
  * What is the amount of the claim? Note that here the manufacturer has NO interest to the equipment
  * 700k (full purchase price)
  * Skeel: Arguably this is not a fully accurate value
    * Implied loan here because ownership transfers
    * If you were to be precise here, you would have to look at which portion of this price is the purchase price for the equipment and which portion is interest. Then determine how much of the interest has accrued.
  * Note: this is an unsecured creditor!!
  * Skeel: with a contractual obligation, the claim is generally for the amount of the contract (although there is no statutory support for this)

* Hypothetical 3:
  * Setup - Debtor gets accused of an anti-trust violation. Claim is filed before bankruptcy. It is a claim for $10M and there is a 3% likelihood that the plaintiff will win against the debtor
  * Question - What is the value of the claim?
  * Option One: most logical way to do it is to do something like….expected value approach
    * Look at the likelihood of success, look at whether the damages requested are reasonable
    * Expected value approach /probability analysis
    * 0.03 x 10M = 300k
  * Other possibilities…
    * Option Two: say it is zero. Low probability suit will result in no claim against debtor (this is the approach taken by the actual case)
    * Option Three: lift the stay and allow the plaintiff to pursue litigation/make the court ultimately determine the value of the claim if plaintiff does win
  * Point: under §502, court has a lot of discretion because it has a lot of power to value the claims

## Secured Creditor Claims

* Secured Creditors:
  * Those who have liens on certain property (real or personal) of the debtor; top priority in bankruptcy
  * Secured creditors have a voluntary lien on property when they have an Article 9 security interest
  * §506(a)(1) - Secured party has a **secured claim to the extent of the value of its collateral**
    * If value of the collateral is less than the claim, difference becomes an unsecured claim
  * Undersecured Creditor:
    * Creditor whose claim is bigger than the value of the collateral (claim > collateral)
    * In bankruptcy, all proceeds of sale go to secured creditor who will then have an unsecured claim for the remaining amount
    * Other Options:
      * Trustee can abandon the property (§544(a))
      * Lift the stay under §362(d) to save expenses of sale (collateral deteriorating in value or debtor has no equity in property and it is not vital to reorganization)
  * Oversecured Creditor:
    * Creditor whose collateral is worth more than the amount due on their loan to debtor [claim < collateral]
    * In bankruptcy, trustee will sell collateral, pay secured creditor, and distribute rest to other creditors
    * Note: Oversecured creditors are entitled to interest and fees

* Remedies for secured creditors OUTSIDE bankruptcy:
  * If borrower does not pay loan on time, secured creditor has the right to repossess its collateral, sell collateral to pay down the loan, and pursue the debtor for deficiency judgment (part of the loan that was not paid off from sale)
  * Note: for deficiency judgment, creditor is an unsecured creditor

* Process for secured creditor INSIDE bankruptcy:
  * Primary role of Trustee in Chapter 7
    1. Disposing of property where there are secured claims
    1. Liquidating the rest and distributing it based on priorities
  * Make sure security interest is perfected (otherwise the trustee can avoid secured claim -> make it unsecured claim)
  * File a proof of claim
  * Note: secured creditors cannot simply repossess/foreclose on collateral because they are subject to the automatic stay (§362(a)(4))
    * Yet, secured creditors can ask for the stay to be lifted, however

### How to Value a Secured Creditor’s - Claim §506(a)

* "Cram down" - In re-org, debtor can elect to keep the property over CR's objections and makes payments over the life of the plan equal to the value of the collateral at time of filing
* §506(a) – “Value should be determined in light of the purpose of valuation and of the proposed disposition/use of such property”
  * Foreclosure Value (how much you would get through foreclosure) v. Replacement Value (how much it would cost to purchase comparable collateral) depends on the situation
* **Rash Test – look to see what the debtor intends to use the property for**:
  * **If debtor liquidates -> foreclosure value**
  * **If debtor using it for business purposes -> replacement value** (determining this value left to the BR courts, though it should not reflect items/features not retained in the property but are reflected in the retail price)
  * **If debtor reorganizes but doesn’t use tractor for business purposes -> foreclosure value or amount debtor sells tractor for**

* Pre-Rash Views
  * Easterbrook Valuation (*Hotchkins*) – should always use the foreclosure value
    * Logic: this is the only value the creditor would get outside of bankruptcy
    * Note: this view ignores the language in the statute (court is supposed to look at the proposed purpose of the property)
  * Posner Valuation: split the difference between the two values
    * Foreclosure value and replacement value
    * Ex: private sale (30k); replacement value used (40k) -> 35k
    * Why? Outside of bankruptcy, there would be a negotiation (the debtor would be willing to pay anything less than 40k –replacement value; the Bank would take anything more than 30k –value bank would get if it underwent a foreclosure sale… thus, it would be somewhere between 30 and 40)

* *Rash* Case:
  * Facts: Ch. 13 case (though also applies to 7 and 11). Debtor exercises its “cram down” power under §1325(a)(5), permitting him to keep property over objection of creditor. Creditor retains a lien securing the claim to the value of the collateral
  * Issue: How should the collateral be valued?
  * Holding: Under §506(a), the property retained via exercise of cram down power should be valued at replacement value because that is cost debtor would incur to obtain comparable collateral
  * > Proposed disposition or uses is important to the valuation question
  * Appropriate to use replacement value (higher value) because creditor is exposed to higher risks. Under cram down, replacement value standard would deprive CR of immediate possession of the collateral while also exposing him to risk of another default while the collateral continues to deteriorate
    * High probability CR receives less in a failed re-org than in prompt foreclosure
  * Rash test reflects reality, don't use foreclosure value if there is no sale
  * Note: §506(a)(2) – Changes Rash applicability when debtor is an individual in Chapter 9 or 13. Still applied when debtor is a corporation and in Ch. 11 cases

* Post-Rash
  * Congress added § 506(a)(2): If a debtor is an individual in Ch. 7 or 13, and creditor has security interest in personal property -> valuation is replacement value
    * Courts used to let Debtors pay foreclosure value. Now personal property in Ch. 7 and 13 must be replacement value.
    * §722 redemption provision: Debtor files for Ch. 7 – Wants to keep things like microwave. If debtor pays trustee value of microwave, can keep it (unlike cram down, CR is paid in full at time of redemption)
* Skeel: Rash applies in Ch. 7, 11, and 13: Every context except the § 506(a)(2) context

* Valuation Hypothetical - Determining Payout of Unsecured Claims:
  * Setup - Small business debtor files for Ch. 11 bankruptcy
    * Assets: (Total = 75k)
      * Tractor -> 50k
      * Other -> 25k
    * Liabilities: (Total = 150k)
      * Bank -> 60k (Secured claim in tractor)
      * Unsecured creditor -> 90k
  * Question: What is the secured creditor’s claim?
    * Outside bankruptcy: $50k (tractor value) along with a $10k deficiency claim (unless CR voluntarily waives it)
      * First come, first serve. Can bring suit for the $10k and get judgement, meaning they are paid in full. However, if too late bringing suit, may get nothing (Creditor's Bargain attempts to avoid this result of rushing in order to get paid)
    * In bankruptcy: Secured claim for $50k, unsecured claim in the amount of $10k (§506(a) – two claims for undersecured creditors)
    * What is the pay out for Bank’s 10k unsecured claim?
      * Pro-rata calculation - in the pool of unsecured claims, there is no ranking system:
        * (10k)/(10+90k) (25k) = 2.5k
        * Determine what fraction of total unsecured claims each CR's claim represents and payout remaining assets on that basis
          * ```(amount of CR's claim / amount of all unsecured claims) * amount of debtor’s remaining assets```
        * Note: This is different than outside of bankruptcy which is a first come/first serve payout and is thought to be a better outcome, as claims are dealt with in orderly fashion through collective process
  * Question: If the value of the tractor is unknown. Which is the correct value of the tractor?
    * Options:
      * Private sale -> $30k (foreclosure value)
      * Debtor buys a tractor like this used -> 40k (used replacement value)
      * Debtor buys a tractor like this new -> 50k (new replacement value)
    * Rash approach: Depends on what the debtor is going to do with the property…
      * If in Ch. 11 (debtor is going to keep the property/using the cramdown or stripdown power) -> replacement value
      * If debtor is abandoning or selling -> foreclosure value (foreclosure value minus cost)
    * §506(a)(2) – If dealing with an individual in a Ch 7 or 13 case (personal property), use the replacement value at the time of the filing
    * What might make the replacement value (new or used) lower?
      * If tractor was used intensely, if debtor’s tractor no longer under warranty (but new ones are)

* Additional Rash Test Hypothetical:
  * Debtor is a corporation
  * Foreclosure value of tractor: 50K
  * Debtor buys used tractor: 75K
  * Cost of new tractor: 80K
  * Debtor files for Chapter 7. What is value?
    * Since debtor is liquidating, tractor will not be used for the business -> foreclosure value, or 50K
  * If debtor files for Chapter 11 or 13. What is value?
    * If in reorganization, debtor uses tractor for his business -> replacement value standard, so 75K
    * if in reorganization, debtor will not use tractor for his business -> foreclosure value, or whatever debtor receives for tractor in the sale of it

### Avoiding Liens - §506(d) + *Dewsnup*

* Plain meaning of §506(d):
  * To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed claim, such lien is void, unless:
    * Such claim was disallowed only under §502(b)(5) – domestic support claim or §502(e) – certain claims for reimbursement or contribution OR
    * Such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of an entity to file a proof of such claim under §501
  * Traditionally, §506(d) was interpreted to permit debtors to “strip down” secured claims to the value of collateral (assuming a claim was over-secured) in certain situations
    * Plain reading suggests this as well: Lien on property would strip down to the value of the secured claim at the time of BR. The lien would survive BR, but the portion converted to an unsecured claim during BR is voided

* *Dewsnup* reading of §506(d):
  * SCOTUS reads it as if the word "secured" had been omitted. Could only void claim if disallowed as fraudulent, for example, and thus there is no strip-down of secured claims (either the whole claim is voided or the entire amount survives BR)
  * §506(d) does not void a lien in excess of amount of secured claim. Instead, under Dewsnup, a lien passes through bankruptcy. Now, after *Caulkett*, even a totally under-water claim (like the second lender in hypothetical below) passes through bankruptcy and can’t be stripped off under Dewsnup
    * Skeel: bad court decision and just about everyone in the BR world agrees
    * Note: “Lien passes through bankruptcy” means that the lienholder’s property interest does not disappear until voluntary dismissal or sale of collateral. Once property is sold (consensual sale or foreclosure proceeding), most liens disappear. Exception being environmental obligations which “run with the land” (meaning if D sold land to third party, third party would be responsible for satisfying the obligation) and tax liens
    * After a statutory sale process (foreclosure, Art. 9 sale), the lien of the creditor who initiated the sale and all subordinate to that lien will be extinguished. The higher priority liens will NOT be extinguished. Neither will the liens held by creditors not involved in the sale. This includes tax liens (highest priority), unless the tax lien holder is the one initiating or consenting to the sale.
    * The debtor selling property outside of bankruptcy will not extinguish liens
    * §363 - provision authorizing sale of property inside bankruptcy. Generally extinguishes liens, however *Dewsnup* was a weird case because it involved abandonment of the property in Chapter 7, but value of the property was not known since no trustee sale
  * The effect of this reading is that bankruptcy case discharges the debtor’s personal liability, but does NOT discharge the in rem liability
  * Additionally, under this reading, the bankruptcy court’s assignment of a secured claim value is not binding and (unlike in non-Dewsnup approach)

* Dewsnup view only applies in Ch. 7 case (not 11 or 13)
  * Why? It would negatively impact debtor’s ability to successfully reorganize and there are provisions in Ch. 11 and 13 that clearly imply debtor being able to reorganize over-collateralized lenders
  * It would also conflict with fresh start principles: purpose of re-org is to enable debtor to rebuild vialble business and we don't want bank to be able to come after th DR for the property later on
    * Without *Dewsnup* reading: Bank has 80K secured and 20 K unsecured -> Bank will get 80K secured with let’s say 20 cents/dollar on unsecured claim, for a total of 85K
    * With *Dewsnup* reading: Bank has 80K secured and 20 K unsecured -> Bank will get 80K secured with let’s say 20 cents/dollar on unsecured claim, for a total of 85K. Plus Bank still has security interest in the equipment (or for the remaining 15K) bc discharge does not include in rem obligations

* Although not limited to such occasion, Dewsnup is most applicable when the property is abandoned by trustee in a Ch. 7 case
  * Big downside of home equity loans is that if you borrowed money and give a second liens on your house, it’s not dischargeable; to get around this, people would file for Ch. 7 and ask court to strip 2nd liens and immediately file for Ch. 13 and would do a rehabilitation plan that would pay off the 1st mortgage in full (dissonance in circuits as to whether this was doable)

* Hypothetical based on *Dewsnup*:
  * Setup - Debtor is a small business in chapter 7
    * Assets: tractor -> court valued at 60K
    * Liabilities:
      * Bank -> 100k (security interest in tractor)—under-secured creditor
      * Second lender -> 25k (security interest in tractor) – Totally under water lienholder
      * Unsecured creditors -> 50k
    * Trustee abandons tractor allowing the bank to foreclose on it (costs less for trustee, bank better positioned to do so, estate won't benefit from it since all proceeds likely will go to bank)
      * Sales price outside of BR: 75k (15k more than court valued property)
  * Question: who gets the extra 15k?
  * *Dewsnup*: Bank gets the 15k because the court’s valuation of the secured claim is not binding, thus lien is not altered (only if entire claim is disallowed would it have any affect)
    * Under Dewsnup, the only way that the debtor would get any value is if the sale price of the tractor were greater than the entire 1st lien (over 100k) and greater than any other liens on the property (more than the additional 25k)
    * Since the estate gave up interest in the property by abandoning it, unsecured creditors will not get anything in ANY scenario
  * *Non-Dewsnup*: Would give the remaining value to the debtor
    * Under this approach, once the court values the claim, it is fixed at that amount and we do not go back and change it
    * Secondary lenders lien gets voided during strip-down and releasing property mean estate has no interest in it. Thus it is the DR that gets the $15k
  * What if the actual sale of the tractor miraculously was for 120k. Who would get this amount?
    * Bank would get the full 40k unsecured claim. Then second lender would get the remaining amount (second lender’s 25k becomes 20k secured claim and 5K unsecured claim)
    * Under Dewsnup, debtor would only get the additional money if the property was sold for more than the amount owed by all of the secured creditors
      * If there was anything leftover from the sale for the unsecured creditor, that goes to the debtor instead of the unsecured creditor under Dewsnup (because of trustee’s abandonment, property has been abandoned back to the debtor); if no abandonment, overages go to the unsecured creditor via the estate
    * Note: There is a logical argument that in this case, the Bank would be an over-collateralized creditor and thus entitled to interest. Yet, under §506(b) would only be able to get interest up to the value of the collateral (here, value is 120, so only able to get 20k in interest). The effect of giving the Bank this interest would be to take money that would’ve been given to the second lender
  * What if: property valued at 60k actually sold for 50k?
    * The Bank gets 50k when it should’ve gotten 60k
    * in the non-Dewsnup word, once we void the unsecured claim (under §506(d)), it is permanent (tough luck Bank). No readjustment because the separation of the claim into secured and unsecured portions (bifurcation) is permanent
    * Unfortunately, we do not live in this world due to the SCOTUS decision in *Dewsnup*

* Summary of Dewsnup Standard: Secured creditor gets proceeds of sale (up to original secured claim), because BR discharges personal liability but not in rem liability
  * The money that debtor owes to Bank is a personal liability to debtor. However, Debtor also has the in rem obligation, aka the property part of the obligation, in this case, the tractor.  lien rides through bankruptcy, assuming property is not sold during bankruptcy case
    * rides through Bankruptcy meaning that it survives through Bankruptcy until property is sold. Once sold, proceeds distributed to whoever has property interest in it
  * SCOTUS’s Rationale:
    * §506a removes security interest to the extent that secured creditor is under-collateralized (so creditor is only secured to extent of value of collateral)
    * However, §506d removes security interest to the extent it’s not an allowed claim under §502 (this can happen if security interest was gotten through fraudulent behavior for instance) or to extent that entity did not file proof of claim. In all other circumstances, lien rides through bankruptcy

* Sold outside of BR for less than estimated value:
  * If property sells for more than court’s value: Secured creditor gets paid MORE than it should, bc it gets paid $80K secured claim + pro rata part of $20K unsecured claim in bankruptcy  PLUS it would get the $15K after bankruptcy!
  * On the flip side, if property sells for less than court’s value: Secured creditor gets paid less than it should, bc it gets what it sold the tractor for (secured claim) + pro rata part of $20K (but that unsecured claim should have been worth more, since truck sale did not cover the full secured claim amount)
  * Therefore, it evens out

* Sold during BR for less than amount of original secured claims -> No Dewsnup Problem
  * If property is sold during the bankruptcy proceeding, the in rem obligation becomes cash and secured creditor gets the cash and there’s no more Dewsnup-type issue!

* Sold during BR for more than amount of original secured claims -> No Dewsnup problem
  * If tractor was sold for more than 100K during bankruptcy, Bank would get up to 100K (its original secured claim) and the rest will go to unsecured creditors (if there was no one else with lien on the tractor)
  * If secured creditor is owed $100k, property worth $120k, and we are inside BR -> secured creditor gets interest on that claim – §506(b): to the extent that you are over-collateralized, you get interest

### Post Filing Interest on Secured Claims - §506(b)

* Over-secured creditors are entitled to interest up until the value of the collateral
  * Interest to be calculated using the contract rate generally (if voluntary)
  * Interest is capped at the “equity cushion” (collateral value – claim amount)
    * In other words, if collateral is worth 110k and Bank owed 100k. Bank can only get up to 10k in interest
  * Concerns post-petition claims (§502(b)(2) worried about pre-petition)
* Also includes reasonable fees, costs, charges
* Undersecured creditors do not get interest (or anything that might resemble interest)
  * Do not get compensated for delay in states’ rights because of bankruptcy and automatic stay application (*Timbers*)

* *Ron Pair*: (Comma case) an over-secured creditor is entitled to interest regardless of whether the lien is consensual/voluntary
  * SCOTUS read §506(b) to allow for interest in both voluntary and involuntary over-collateralized cases (including the IRS)
  * However, only entitled to fees if it says so in the written agreement

* *Timbers*:
  * Facts: Bank (under-secured creditor) was asking for interest starting 6 months after bankruptcy petition was filed.
  * Tom Jackson’s creditors bargain theory: outside of bankruptcy, debtor would not have been able to stop foreclosure proceedings, which would’ve taken approximately 6 months for Bank to complete. After 6 months, theoretically, Bank would’ve reinvested and been receiving interest, so Bank is entitled to interest inside bankruptcy. Statutory hook for this argument in §362(d)(1) – creditors entitled to “adequate protection”
  * Holding: denied any interest because under-secured creditors are not allowed interest. (506(b) clearly spells out that only over-secured creditors are entitled to it)
  * Note: everyone agrees that “adequate protection” means that a creditor should be compensated if the value of the collateral securing its loan depreciates over the course of bankruptcy. This argument unsuccessfully tried to stretch “adequate protection” to include consideration for lost opportunity costs.
    * This is because compensation for delay would be seen as interest and §362(d)(1) only guarantees “adequate protection” (i.e. that the value of secured collateral will not go down/drop during the bankruptcy case)
    * BUT, an under-secured creditor can still get rents (so long as creditors have an appropriate security interest in rents under §552(b))
      * Ex: if creditor has 110k claim and collateral is worth 95k, but creditor has security interest in rents (2k/month)…creditor gets 2k every month from rents until 95k reaches full 110k
  * Creditors do get interest on the value of property the debtor keeps in a reorganization (Ch.11) starting from the date of confirmation

* Class Hypothetical Setup
  * Individual debtor files chapter 7. Has a house valued at 100k. Claims involved are:
    * Bank -> 125k
    * Secondary Lender -> 80k
    * Unsecured -> 50k
  * Trustee abandons house to the bank who has a security interest in it. House sells for $110k ($10k over)
    * Note - Bank is undercollateralized and unsecured creditors, meaning there is nothing that would be left over for unsecured creditors. Thus there is no benefit in trustee further pursuing. Could be that bank is simply in better position to sell the house
* Question: Who gets the $10k in surplus value?
* Dewsnup Court
  * Bank would get this. Grounded in idea that security interest rides throughout bankruptcy. This means if property is still there after bankruptcy (e.g. doesn't get sold), that property interest is still there and thus bank (lienholder) entitles it the entirety of the proceeds
    * Lien dissolves at the time of sale, but if never sold lien still exists
    * Bankruptcy does not discharge *in rem* liability (i.e. liability of the property)
* Alternative Interpretation
  * Lien doesn't "slide" through bankruptcy. Value of home is permanently fixed at $100k at time of valuation and at that time, the extent to which lienholder is undercollateralized converts to an unsecured claim. Fact that property sells above this value doesn't matter because lien on everything in excess of $100k has been voided (i.e. lien is stripped down)
    * Seems like a more natural reading of §506
