# Consumer Bankruptcies - Chapter 7 & Chapter 13

## Key Provisions - Chapter 7

### 109(b) - Basic Eligibility for Chapter 7 Filing

* Person (defined in §101(41) includes individuals, partnerships, or corporations) OR a corporation (defined in §101(9)).
  * Excluded: Commercial banks, Insurance companies, Railroads

### §101(8) - Definition of consumer debts (imp. bc determines whether DR subject to means test)

* Debts incurred by an individual primarily for personal, family, or household purposes
  * Note: to be distinguished form an individual with business debts or partnerships/corporations with debts

### §707(b) - Means Test for Chapter 7

* Exempts all DRs whose (current monthly income x 12) is at or below the median family income from being rejected from Chapter 7 on the basis of the means test
  * §101(10A) - Current Monthly Income (CMI)
    * Average monthly income for the 6 months pre-bankruptcy
    * Includes income from all sources (NOT social security benefits)
    * Note: If dealing with a joint case, it includes spouse’s income as well
  * Note: CMI can be easily manipulated so that it is below the state median by waiting a few months to file after a lay off for instance (see HYPO below with two identical employees filing at different points)
* Even though DR cannot be kicked out of Ch. 7 because of the means test, DR can still be screened under it

* §707(b)(7) - DRs whose **current monthly income is below the state median are eligible for Ch. 7** and do not have to be subject to the means test

* Once you have determined that DR’s current monthly income is above the state median, look to see if DR fails part two of the means test. If DR fails means test, DR is kicked out of Ch. 7 (presumption of abusive filing that can only be rebutted in special circumstances under §707(b)(2)(B)

* **Application of Means Test**:
  * Pre-Step: determine whether the DR’s current monthly income x 12 (annual income) is above the state median provided by the IRS
  * Step One: Determine which category DR falls into based on the amount of unsecured debt he owes. The category will provide the amount DR must be able to pay in order to fail the means test
    * Unsecured less than 29,900 -> fail if over $7,475
    * Unsecured btw 29,900- 49,900 -> fail if over 25% of debt owed
    * Unsecured over 49,900 -> fail if over $12,475
  * Step Two: Determine whether the DR can pay the amount identified in step one.
    * Look at excess/disposable monthly income [CMI - deductions/allowances based on living expenses] x 60 [usual term of plan]
    * Note: if this number is greater than the number in step one, then the DR fails the means test and is kicked out of Ch. 7 because of a presumption of abuse

* **§707(b)(3)** - Allows court to throw out a case that is filed in bad faith or as an abuse of the system regardless of the means test or CMI below median
  * Includes abusive pre-bankruptcy planning; living so extravagantly; purchases made in anticipation of filing; etc.
  * Note: motion can only be made by US trustee or judge, NOT creditors
  * Limitation on Ct’s ability to dismiss: charitable contributions cannot be used as the basis to show bad faith filing

* **§707(b)(2)(B)** - DR can rebut the presumption of abuse created by failing the means test under “special circumstances”
  * “Special Circumstances” - limited to situations, like serious medical condition, call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces
  * Note: can use these limited circumstances to the extent they justify additional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income for which there is no reasonable alternative

## Key Provisions - Chapter 13

### §109(e) - Eligibility for a Ch. 13 case

* DR must be a “natural person”/individual with regular income
* DR must have **non-contingent and liquidated** debts less than:
  * $394,725 in unsecured
  * $1,184,200 in secured

* DR must also satisfy other requirements:
  * §109(h) - DR must meet credit counseling requirements
  * §1325(a)(7) - DR must have filed petition in good faith

### §1325 Confirmation of Plan

* **§1325(a)(3) - Good Faith Requirement for Filing**
  * The plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law
  * Skeel: Good faith provision has extra teeth when DR wants to use the super discharge

* **§1325(a)(4) - Best Interest of Creditors Test**
  * Value of property to be distributed among unsecured CRs is just as much as they would under a Ch. 7 liquidation

* **§1325(b)(1) - Disposable income test**
  * If any creditor objects, DR must show that plan provides for all disposable income to be dedicated towards repayment of unsecured CRs
  * In the event that CR objects, Court would have to figure out DR’s disposable income, which raises issues about how to evaluate standards of living

* **§1325(a)(5) - Modifying secured claims in Ch. 13 (stripdown)**
  * Allows DR to modify some agreements and security interest in chapter 13

### §1322 - Contents of Plan

* **§1322(b)(2)**
  * Limits ability to modify mortgages secured only by a security interest in real property that is the DR’s principal residence

### §1328 - Discharge in a Chapter 13 situation

* **§1328(a)** - Super Discharge (see discharge section)

* **§1328(b)** - Hardship discharge in non-completed Ch. 13 plan
  * Applies in a situation where the debtor fails to complete a Ch. 13 plan, but tried really hard to comply. Hardship discharge (non-completed Ch. 13 plan)
  * Get a discharge for everything except your §523(a) non-dischargeable debts.

## The Means Test for Chapter 7 Filing (Did not discuss in detail during class)

* §707(b) establishes means test
  * Main form to file for Ch. 7 case.
  * Point: Tries to weed out those who are able to pay back most of their debts
  * If DR fails means test, he is kicked out of chapter 7 bankruptcy because there is a presumption of abuse
    * Skeel: Requirement can be justified in principle, but not a test that can be defended in practice. Widespread view of hostility toward it in the community. Main effect is to make it a little more expensive to file for Ch7 case (price to get a bankruptcy lawyer went up)
  
* Who is subject to the means test?
  * Only individuals with mostly consumer debts (§101(8))
  * NOT…individuals with business debts; partnerships; corporations
  * NOT…individuals who fall below the state median income

## Choosing Between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13

### Hypothtetical: Choosing between Chapter 7 & Chapter 13

* Setup: Debtor makes $35k/year
  * Assets:
    * Beach house worth $100k
  * Debts:
    * Bank -> 75k
    * Credit Card -> 50k
    * Neighbor Lawsuit Pending -> 1M (based on DR’s intentional destruction to property)
  * Plan:
    * Bank: Cure and reinstate loan
    * Credit card: pay $15k
    * Neighbor: pay $15k
* Should DR file in Chapter 7 or 13?
  * The answer is almost certainly Chapter 13
    * Lawsuit will be dischargeable under Chapter 13 if plan is completed ((a)(6) is excluded from non-dischargeable debts in Ch13 when applied to property, but non-dischargeable in Chapter 7 (§523(a)(6) -willful and malicious injury to person/property non-dischargeable)
    * DR gets to keep the beach house
* Can this DR file for Ch. 13?
  * Chapter 13 has debt ceilings - §109(e): DR must have non-contingent and liquidated debts less than
    * $394,725 in unsecured
    * $1,184,200 in secured
* Issue: At this point, there is just a lawsuit filed (unsecured obligation that would put it over the threshold). But, the DR can still file for Ch. 13 bc this lawsuit is contingent and the threshold only looks at non-contingent, liquidated debts

* Modification: The court determines that the value of the neighbor’s lawsuit claim is $50k
  * Note: it is still contingent even if the bankruptcy court puts a value on the claim. The bankruptcy court putting a value on the lawsuit is not a judgment, so it is still considered contingent. Need a final judgment (court ruling at the time of bankruptcy filing) for it to be non-contingent and included in the threshold amount in 109
  * Skeel: Once there is a final judgment pre-bankruptcy, it is liquidated, non-contingent, and secured claim (there is a property interest)

* What happens if the neighbor objects to the Ch. 13 plan?
  * Would have to apply the §1325(a)(4) -Best Interest Of Creditors Test. Determine how much neighbor would’ve gotten in a chapter 7 liquidation case to see if this payout (15k) is less than that amount
    * Unsecured CR would get 25k btw the two of them bc cottage is worth 100k, but subject to 75k mortgage. This would result in 12,500 each bc their claims are valued at the same 50k amount.
* Result: since 12,500 is less than the 15k promised under the Ch 13 plan, the neighbor does not have a valid objection under §1325(a)(4) - Best Interests Test
  * Note: it would be possible for the neighbor to invoke §1325(a)(3) -Good Faith Requirement for Filing.
  * Could also look to §1325(b)(1) - Determine whether the DR has devoted all of his disposable income to the plan

## Overview of Chapter 13

* Multi-year repayment plan that must be confirmed by creditors
* Basic Eligibility Requirements:
  * DR must be a “natural person”/individual with regular income
    * Note: source of income is irrelevant. Spouses of DR with regular income are eligible for Ch. 13 even if they themselves to not have regular income
  * DR must have non-contingent and liquidated debts less than…
    * $394,725 in unsecured
    * $1,184,200 in secured
  * DR must also satisfy other requirements:
    * §109(h) - DR must meet credit counseling requirements
    * §1325(a)(7) - DR must have filed petition in good faith

### Challenges to Chapter 13 Plan

* DR is subject to the Good Faith Filing Requirement (§1325(a)(7))
* DR’s plan must satisfy Best Interest of CR Test if plan is challenged (§1325(a)(4))
* DR must devote all disposable income to plan if CR objects (§1325(b)(1))
  * If below median income, use IRS standards to determine disposable income amount. Otherwise, court makes an ad hoc determination
  * Note: use the calculations based on the means test to determine the amount of disposable income DR has

### Chapter 13 Discharge

* §1328(a) - Super Discharge
  * Do NOT get a discharge unless DR makes all payments on debts as proposed in Ch 13 plan. Do not get any benefit if fail to meet the requirements of the plan. If fail, debts return to the original amount rather than the proposed amount in the plan
  * Note: different than chapter 11, which discharges obligations upon confirmation of the plan (ex: if under the plan you propose paying CR 20 cents on the dollar then that is all CR is entitled to demand in the event DR defaults)

* §1328(b) - Hardship Discharge
  * Good faith effort to pay + not DR’s fault that he couldn’t repay
  * Note: courts are pretty tough. Limited exception (similar to the student loan undue hardship exception)

## DR’s Power To Modify Secured Claims Under Ch. 13

* §1325(a)(5) - Allows DRs to modify some agreements/security interests
  * Note: Dewsnup has not been construed to apply in Ch. 13 plan. If property is worth less, CR has a secured claim to the extent of the value of the property

* §1322(b)(2) - Limitation on ability to modify some secured claims
  * Cannot modify a home mortgage that is secured just by the DR’s primary residence
  * Example: House is worth 50k, mortgage secured by just the house (which is DR’s primary residence) is 75k. Once bifurcated under §506(a), Bank really has a 50k secured claim and 25k unsecured claim. BUT, the entire mortgage cannot be modified under Chapter 13 plan because of §1322(b)(2)
  
* Nobelman v. American Savings Bank
  * Facts: Bank loaned DR 68k to buy house, took a security interest in the residence. DR filed for Ch. 13 at time when the house was valued at only 23k. So, Bank was an undersecured CR
  * DR argued it should only have to make payments under Ch. 13 plan up to 23k, interpreting §1322(b)(2) to apply only to the secured portion of the home mortgage
  * Holding: §1322(b)(2) applies to the whole mortgage, so DR cannot re-write/modify the unsecured portion after §506(a) bifurcation

* When does the special §1322(b)(2) protection apply?
  * ONLY when home mortgage is secured by only the DR’s principal residence
    * Key word in §1322(b)(2) special protection = ONLY
    * Note: standard additions to security interests for mortgages ok (such as insurance on the house)
  * NOT when mortgage is secured by things beyond the principal residence
    * Examples: SI on things in the house (paintings/computers), fixtures (e.g. microwave attached to the wall)

* Wilson v. Commonwealth Mortgage Co
  * Facts: Mortgage is secured by DR’s residence and “any and all appliances, machinery, furniture, equipment now or hereafter installed on premises”
  * Holding: 1322(b)(2) exception does not apply to this mortgage because it is not only secured by the DR’s principal residence
  * Note: 1322(b)(2) protection also does not apply to a mortgage that is secured by a vacation home (rather than DR’s primary residence)
    * NOT when mortgage is secured by another residence that is not DR’s primary residence (e.g. beach house). In this case, mortgage on the beach house can be written down/stripped down and bifurcated into secured and unsecured claims

* What happens if entire second mortgage is under water?
  * Note: second mortgages (often called “home equity loans”) are very common. Double-edged sword—way to consolidate other types of debt and get a lower interest rate. Problem is that it pulls DR into §1322(b)(2), which means you cannot re-negotiate down these claims and it may cost you your house.
  * Some courts say DR can stripdown a second mortgage that is totally under water -as opposed to under secured-(*Tanner*), but Skeel suggests that it is unclear given *Caulkett* (holding that *Dewsnup*’s policy of a lien riding through bankruptcy applies to a fully underwater lien) means it is no longer so clear that you can allow stripdown for fully underwater mortgage
  * Argument still allow stripdowns:
    * Not so inclined to fuel the second mortgage market. So might conclude that we do not really want to help that market and so we should still allow the stripping down of fully underwater second mortgages
  * Argument not to allow stripdown:
    * Completely underwater mortgage is not a really allowed secured claim (ct rejected this arg in Caulkett)

### Hypothetical - Mortgage Write-Down

* Setup - House worth 75k
  * First Mortgage = 100k.
  * Second Mortgage = 50k. (completely underwater)
  * Mortgage 1 is a mortgage on the house, computers in the house, painting.
  * Mortgage 2 is exclusively secured by home
* Question: Is the DR going to be able to write down the mortgages on the house in Chapter 13 case?
  * **Yes**, §1322(b)(2) protection for home mortgages does not apply here because the mortgage is secured by more than just the DR’s primary residence (also secured by the computers, painting)
* Can you stripoff  Mortgage 2 (completely underwater)?
  * This depends: *Tanner* would say yes, but Skeel believes *Caulkett* decision suggests otherwise
