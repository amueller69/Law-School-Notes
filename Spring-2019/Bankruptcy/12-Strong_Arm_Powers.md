# Trustee's Strong Arm Powers

## Key Provisions

### §544 – Trustee’s “Strong Arm” Powers

* Empowers trustee to avoid unperfected property interests, thereby turning CR claims into unsecured claims
  * > The trustee shall have, as of the commencement of the case, and without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor, the rights and powers of, or may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable \[under the conditions listed under this subsection\]
* Essentially treats trustee as having a lien on every piece of property that the DR has starting at the moment of the filing
* Note: This power prevails even if the trustee has knowledge of other creditors (support provided by introduction language in (a) saying “without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditors”). Does NOT prevail if trustee has notice or if applicable state law deems constructive notice sufficient for perfection

* **§544(a)(1) + (a)(2) – Personal property lien “strong arm” powers**
  * Trustee assumes the status of a creditor that is a judicial lien holder (whether or not such exists), which has priority over unperfected claims
    * Note: Trustees trying to capture the differences in state law regarding when a judicial lien takes effect (properly perfect lien)
    * Bottom line  = trustee can eliminate any property interest that is not properly perfected
  * Beware of retroactive effect to perfection
    * When applicable non-bankruptcy law provides retroactive effect to perfection, perfection after bankruptcy defeats rights of trustee under §544(a)(1)

* **§544(a)(3) – Real Property Strong Arm Power**
  * Trustee has status of a bona fide purchaser of real estate/real property (minus fixtures) that has perfected such transfer prior to commencement
  * Puts holder of an unrecorded mortgage in the same position as a holder of an unperfected UCC security interest
  * Note: there is a difference here based on the differences in real estate (needed to make the trustee more powerful, although it has the same effect as (a)(1)/(2))

### §541(d) - Property of Estate

* **What to do with Property Held by DR as Nominee or Trustee**
  * §541(d) – Estate provision that says that property the DR holds only legal title to comes into the estate under §541(a)(1) and (a)(2), but is limited to just the legal title. NOT equitable/beneficial interest
    * Skeel: By its very terms, §541(d) does NOT apply to property the trustee recovers using the strong arm powers (incl 544(a)(3)), which is brought into the estate under §541(a)(3). §541(d) is limited to property that comes into the estate through 541(a)(1) and 541(a)(2)
  * Compared with §544(a)(3). §544(a)(3) is the strong arm provision that allows for the trustee to avoid unrecorded property interests (i.e. can avoid equitable interest of those who failed to record their interest in the property)
    * Note: Technically, this property is brought into the estate under §550, which is the provision that empowers the trustee to actually recover the property identified under 544(a)(3)
  * Some courts held that 541(d) and 544(a)(3) do NOT conflict, meaning that unrecorded interests in real property can be avoided by the trustee using 544(a)(3) (*Belisle v. Plunkett*)

## When Can Strong Arm Powers (§544) Be Invoked

* Strong arm powers are extremely important. These powers are meant to discourage secret liens. Applicable in circumstances where there was a failure to perfect (either because of a failure to file financing statement or failure to provide notice in real estate context). These powers do not eliminate the claim, but make a property interest into an unsecured claim
* When the trustee has “notice”?  NO
  * Rule: Notice is NOT the same as knowledge. Notice is sufficient for perfection, which disallows trustee’s avoidance power under §544. Trustee having knowledge is ok/can still avoid
  * Note: beware of instances in which applicable state law provides for constructive notice as sufficient for perfection (example= PA)

  * *McCannon v Marston*
    * Facts: McCannon bought condo from DR (hotel) and lived there, never having properly perfected the sale.
    * Trustee tries to avoid M’s interest in condo under §544(a)(3)
    * Under PA law, interest is automatically perfected if actual or constructive notice is giving. Living in property qualifies as constructive notice
    * Holding: DR’s trustee CANNOT avoid M’s interest under §544(a)(3)
    * Rule: notice is not the same as knowledge. Under applicable state law, constructive notice is enough for perfection, which means that §544 does not apply

* When DR holds property as a nominee or trustee? Courts are split
  * Some jurisdictions hold that what it says on the deed is actual ownership (in which case legal title would convey actual ownership) and under §544(a)(3) the trustee as a bona fide purchaser has priority over unrecorded interest of others

### Hypothetical: Diocese As Legal Title Holder

* Setup: Church bankruptcy cases. Many churches filed for bankruptcy. Property is technically owned by the Church corporation because that is what is listed on the deed (legal title). Church corporation files for bankruptcy. Nominally the church is the owner of the property, but there is an argument that the property is truly owned by the parish/parishioners. Tension between legal ownership (diocese) and beneficial ownership (parish/parishioners).
* Question: Who owns the property?
  * Note: This question is important because if the diocese (DR) owns the property, it is part of the estate, whereas if the parish/parishioners own the property, it is not part of the estate
* Parishioners argue that it is their property. Could point to 541(d) and say that even if the property is part of DR’s estate, it is limited to the legal interest (not beneficial interest)
* Trustee will argue that even if the parish/parishioners are have a beneficial interest in the property, §544(a)(3) grants the trustee the status of a bona fide purchaser of real property, which has the power to obtain this property free and clear of the unrecorded beneficial interests of the parishioners. Since the parish/parishioners’ name is not on the deed, their interests are unrecorded/unperfected
* Plunkett: A constructive trust/beneficial interest of the parish/parishioners could be overridden by §544(a)(3) because as the legal title owner, the Diocese would have been able to sell the property free and clear of any interests to third parties
