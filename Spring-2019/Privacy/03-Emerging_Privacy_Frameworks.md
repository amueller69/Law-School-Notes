# Emerging Privacy Frameworks

## GDPR

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant update to Europe's comprehensive privacy law. The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018
  * Strengthens data protection under law, providing new data protection rights to individuals and responsibilities for entities handling personal data

### GDPR Overview

* **Chapter 1: General Provisions**
  * GDPR generally applies when **personal data** of a data subject is processed
    * Personal data is information that can identify an individual (including some pseudonymized data if it can be linked back to an individual, but not fully anonymous data)
    * Certain sensitive data, like biometrics, warrant heightened protection
  * **Processing** is broadly defined and includes may types of activities related to handling data, like collection, transmission, and storage
  * GDPR applies to **controllers**, those who direct the purposes and means of how data is processed, and **processors**, those that actually process the data on behalf of the controller
  * GDPR applies to both the public and private sectors (national security/law enforcement exception. It also applies to **all companies which process European consumers' personal data**. This includes:
    * Companies with an “establishment” in the EU, regardless of where they process personal data. This would mean cloud-based processing performed outside of the EU for an EU-based company is covered
    * Companies that monitor behavior and collect data on subjects who are located within the EU (even if no transactions take place). Generally, these companies will need to appoint a representative in the EU
    * Companies based outside the EU that provide services or goods to the EU (including for free). These companies may also need to appoint representative in the EU

* **Chapter 2: Principles**
  * General Principles for Processing Data - Data must be:
    * Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals
    * Collected for specified, explicit and **legitimate purposes** and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (unless public interest exception)
    * Adequate, relevant and **limited to what is necessary** in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
    * Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; Reasonable steps taken to
    * Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
    * Processed in a manner that **ensures appropriate security** of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss
  * Lawfulness of processing One of six lawful bases for processing must be present before any processing can occur:
    * Consent of the data subject - Made by clear **affirmative action** (opt-in)
    * Contract
    * Legal obligation
    * Vital interests
    * Public interest
    * Legitimate interests - Where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller, except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject)

* **Chapter 3: Rights of the Data Subject**

  * The right to be informed - When their data is collected, data subjects must be informed about the purposes for which the data will be processed, the categories of personal data obtained, how long it will be retained, and more
  * The right of access - Right to information about whether their data is being processed, and, if so, have a right to access their personal data which is being processed
  * The right to rectification - Right to correct their personal data or complete any data which is incomplete
  * The right to erasure - Right to erasure of personal data which has been collected (i.e. a right to be forgotten) in certain circumstances, including that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected
  * The right to restrict processing - Right to request that an entity limit the processing of his or her data in certain circumstances, for instance where the individual alleges the data is incorrect or is being unlawfully processed
  * The right to data portability - Right to obtain their data from a service and transmit it to another service for use
  * The right to object - Data subjects have a right to object to processing based on "legitimate interest", to direct marketing, and to processing for research purposes
  * Rights related to automated decision making and profiling - Special heightened rights when they are profiled or evaluated by some automated process or algorithm, including the right not to be subject to them where it has legal or similarly significant effects or the right to know that they are subject to one
    * Exceptions to data subject's ability to object: Necessary for performing a contract between controller; Authorized by EU or Member state law; Is based on explicit (opt-in) consent; Legitimate grounds that override rights of data subject/legal claims

* **Chapter 4 : Obligations of Controller and Processor**
  * Data protection by design and by default - Technical and organizational measures must be implemented to advance data protection principles
  * EU representative - Entities outside the EU but subject to the GDPR must have a representative in the EU
  * Record-keeping - Records of processing activities must be kept
  * Security of processing - Technical and organizational measures must be implemented to ensure security, like pseudonymization and encryption
  * Notification of data breach - Within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach that poses a risk to individual rights and freedoms, a supervisory authority must be notified. Data subjects must be notified without undue delay
  * Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) - An assessment of the risks to data protection is required processing runs a high risk for individual rights, and must consult a supervisory authority before processing where the DPIA indicates a high risk is no protective measures are taken
  * Data protection officers - DPOs must be appointed to oversee and advise on compliance issues if the entity is a public authorities, or an entity with core activities involving large scale, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals or large scale processing of special categories of data or data concerning criminal convictions and offenses

* **Chapter 5: Transfers of personal data to third countries or international orgs**
  * The transfer of personal data outside the EU is limited unless data protection guarantees under the GDPR will be maintained - such as where commission decides country adequate protections/safeguards and contractual
  * Commission takes into account a number of considerations in assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, including: the country's legislation, respect for freedoms, national security measures, etc
  * In the absence of an adequacy determination,  a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country **only if** the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available (usually via contract)

* **Chapter 6: Independent supervisory authorities**
  * Each member state must provide independent supervisory authorities that monitor and enforce GDPR (e.g. through fines, investigations, orders, guidance, etc.). Purpose of this is consistent application of GDPR throughout the EU

* **Chapter 7: Cooperation and consistency**
  * Establishes a system of coordination, information sharing, and assistance between aforementioned supervisory authorities. Creates a consistency mechanism to ensure common approach to enforcement of GDPR. Also establishes a European Data Protection Board, an official body of the EU that will resolve disputes between authorities and work to adopt new guidelines and recommendations

* **Chapter 8: Remedies, liability and penalties**
  * Individuals have the right to lodge complaints with a supervisory authority and a right to challenge in court an authority's legally binding decision concerning them

* **Chapter 9: Provisions relating to specific processing situations**
  * Sets out special standards for specific processing situations, such as how to reconcile protection of personal data with values like transparency, public access, and freedom of expression. This chapter permits (and sometimes requires) member states to set separate rules and conditions for certain specific contexts

* **Chapter 10: Delegated acts and implementing acts**
  * Authorizes European Commission to adopt delegated acts further developing and implementing the GDPR provisions

* **Chapter 11: Final Provisions**
  * Repeals the previous data protection directive and sets date of GDPR's applicability

### Key Changes from the EU Data Protection Directive

* Data processors as well as data controllers are directly liable under GDPR. Under the 1995 Directive, only controllers were directly liable. Data processors are now required to have a contract with data controllers to process personal data

* Slightly expands definition of personal data, which is defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier (e.g. name, uuid, IP, location,)...or to one or more factors specific to the...identity of that person". Under the Directive, personal data was defined as data such as names, photos, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and personal identification numbers (social security, bank account, etc.)

* Two new categories of data, genetic and biometric data, join the prior list of “sensitive” or “special” personal data: data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and data concerning health or sex life and sexual orientation

* Under GDPR, organizations must delete data that is not being used for its original purpose

* Heightened consent requirements. GDPR requires explicit opt-in for the processing of any personal data, and **consent for the use of personal data must be informed, specific, and unambiguous**. Thus, now require clear affirmative action, and individuals can revoke their consent to data processing at any time. Consumers also cannot be asked to agree to contract terms in exchange for their consent

* New rights established
  * Right to access - Gives individuals the right to obtain from data controllers information on how their data is being used, where, and for what purpose. Also entitled to copy of information stored on them, free of charge
  * Right to be forgotten - if a person submits such a request, data controllers must erase and cease all further use of the data

* Along with new documentation requirements, organizations are now required to actively track how and where data is stored and used throughout the supply chain. This entails adopting risk management tools, building security and privacy into their operations by design, and conducting impact assessments on certain activities

* Imposes single uniform breach notification law. Under the Directive, member states were free to adopt their own. Under GDPR controllers must notify their supervisory authority and individuals affected by a personal data breach within 72 hours of learning about the breach and must provide certain details in the notification

* Penalties - For some GDPR violations, such as lacking consent to process data or violating privacy by design, organizations could be charged up to 4% of their global revenue. Other violations such as failing to keep records could see fines up to 2%

* The territorial scope has been increased. The regulation applies to all companies that process personal data of people residing in the EU, regardless of the company’s location

* Other Changes - The minimum age for individuals whose data can be collected rises from 13 to 16. Large data controllers must appoint a data protection officer. There is a single national office for complaints

### CCPA

* Differences From GDPR
  * Small firm exemption
  * Incl. of firms controlled by covered firms
  * Inclusion of households and devices
  * Omission of pseudonymous data
  * No right of correction
  * Opt out instead of opt in
  * No ability to limit processing
  * Bundling of consent
  * 12-mo. limit on consent
  * Time limits on data retention
  * Smaller penalties(?)
  * Fewer institutional obligations

## Cases Under Arising out of the EU Data Protection Directive of 1995

### *Bodil Lindqvist v. Jönköping* (ECJ, 2003)

* Facts: D set up a site for her church with information about her and other staff members of her parish. Information included their full names, telephone numbers, and family circumstances. However, D did not inform her colleagues or the proper authorities. She was charged with violating the Swedish data protection law that was passed to satisfy the 1995 Directive
* Holding: ECJ addresses several questions regarding the interpretation of the Swedish law and the 1995 Directive
  * The act of referring, on an internet page, to persons and identifying them by name or by other means constitutes the "processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means" under the meaning of the Directive. Thus, D's failure to notify subjects prior to this "processing" was a violation
    * Names are clearly information relating to an identifiable person, and loading personal data on an internet page is processing that information
  * Reference to the fact that one of the staff members injured their foot and was on medical leave constitutes sensitive data concerning health for the purpose of the Directive. Processing this information without prior authorization violated the law
  * There was no transfer of data to a third country, within the meaning of the directive, where an individual loads personal data onto an internet page which is hosted within an EU member state, but accessible by anyone who connects to the internet (including those people in a third country)
    * The alternative construction would to be too broad of a reading. People could never share information online since many countries with access to the internet lack the privacy protections of the EU. Thus, D’s sharing of information online did not constitute a transfer of data to a third country
  * Finally , Directive does not conflict with freedom of expression and other freedoms because it is the obligation of national authorities, in implementing the directive through its own legislation. to ensure a fair balance between the rights and interests in question. Any such infringements on freedoms are the result of the member state's implementation, not the directive itself

### *College van burgemeester en wethouders van Rotterdam v. Rijkeboer* (ECJ 2009)

* Background: Case concerning individual's right, under the 1995 Directive, of access to data and information on the sharing of that data. Rijkeboer, P, brought suit against the College after it declined to fully provide him information on the disclosure of his personal data to third parties over the last three years. The College, however, had partially complied with his request by providing such information, but only that which dated back to the previous year. The College argues that the Directive does not provide any fixed time period and that it had complied with the law of the Netherlands (which only requires 1-year history)
* Holding:
  * Court holds the Directive clearly requires Member States to ensure a right of access to information on the recipients of personal data and on the content of that data, not only in respect of the present but also in respect of the past. However, the court says it is for Member States to fix a time-limit for storage and access to that information which constitutes a fair and reasonable balance between privacy interests of the individual and the burden it would impose on the controller
  * Asserts limiting the storage of this information to a period of one year, while basic data is stored for a much longer period, **do not constitute a fair balance of the interest and obligation at issue, unless it can be shown that longer storage of that information would constitute an excessive burden on the controller**
    * However, ECJ says it is up to the for the national courts (of the Netherlands) to make this determination about the burden such expanded retention periods would have on data controllers

### *Heniz Huber v. Germany* (ECJ 2008)

* Facts: Huber, an Austrian national, moved to Germany in 1996 in order to work there as a self-employed insurance agent. The following data was stored in the German Central Register of Foreign Nationals: his name, date and place of birth, nationality, marital status and gender; a record of his entries into and exits from Germany, and his residence status; details of passports issued to him; a record of his previous domicile; and reference numbers issued by the Bundesamt (Office for Migration). Huber claimed he was discriminated against because no such database existed in respect of German nationals and unsuccessfully moved to have this data erased
* Holding:
  * ECJ rules that a system for processing personal data relating to EU citizens, who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, and intended to support to the national immigration authorities, does not satisfy the requirement of necessity as an exception to the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality, unless:
    * It contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities, and
    * Its centralized nature enables the legislation relating to the right of residence (i.e. immigration law) to be more effectively applied as regards EU citizens who are not nationals of that Member State
  * It is up to the national courts of Germany to determine whether such criteria are met
    * The storage and processing of individualized personal information for statistical purposes cannot, for example, could not be considered as necessary under this meaning

## The Safe Harbor Arrangement

* 1995 DPD regulated transfer of personal data to third countries with the following principles:
  * Transfer may take place only if the third country in question can ensure adequate levels of protection
    * Adequate protection does not mean equivalent protection. Shall be assessed in light of the circumstances surrounding the transfer, the nature of the data, proposed use/processing, the rules of law of the of the country, and its professional rules, standards, and security measures
  * Member states must information each other in cases where they determine the third country cannot ensure such adequate protection. Member state must then take measures necessary to avoid all such future transfers of the same nature to that third country

* Major differences between the EU privacy directive and the US approach
  * US also lacks omnibus privacy protection law
  * Threatens the free flow of information between the two
  * Also leaves American as second class citizens in the global market as many areas adopting the EU approach and its heightened privacy

* To preserve the billions of dollars in trade and data flows of US based MNCs operating in the EU, the US and EU successfully negotiated a "Safe Harbor" arrangement in 2000
  * Designed to protect privacy of EU citizens without forcing the US to adopt EU style privacy rules
  * Under the agreement, US firms may transfer data if they participate in self-certification/regulatory privacy program that conforms to the Safe Harbor (e.g. TRUSTe)

* Certifying firms are expected to adopt a published privacy policy and adhere to the seven Safe Harbor principles:
  * **Notice**: an organization must inform individuals about the purposes for which it collects and uses information about them, how to contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses information, and the choices and means the organization offers individuals for limiting its use and disclosure
    * Notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information
  * **Choice**: an organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information is
    * To be disclosed to a third party or
    * To be used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected
      * If information sensitive (e.g. medical information, race, etc.), then must opt in
  * **Access**: individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate
  * **Onward transfer**: to disclose information to third parties, organizations must follow the notice and choice principles. Must ensure that the third party is following the same stringent privacy standards
  * **Security**: must protect personal information
  * **Data integrity**: personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used
    * An organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current
  * **Enforcement**: effective privacy protection must include mechanisms to assure compliance with the principles

## Right to Be Forgotten

### *Google Spain v. AEPD* (2014 ECJ)

* Facts: Complaint based on fact that a Google search linked two newspaper old articles to a man’s name. Article pertained to 16 year old data about real-estate auction connected with attachment proceedings for recovery of social security debt
* Holding: Links must be removed from the list of results
* Reasoning:
  * Uploading information to internet is processing personal data. Thus, search engine engages in processing personal data when it searches and collects such information
    * This makes search engine operator a controller of personal data
  * Court concerned about ability to use a name to get a list of information on a person through a search engine, especially when it is likely personal
    * Needs to be a balance between privacy interests and the interest in having readily available information. Usually privacy interests outweigh accessibility, but may not be the case when great public interest in having the information or when the cost of removing would be particularly burdensome on the processor
    * Here, privacy is given more weight. Some exceptions, such as if person a public figure and interest in their life. Basically needs to be an overriding public interest in that information. However, such public interest is not served here and thus privacy prevails
  * Person may request information be removed from search results, even if true and not prejudicial, and the search engine must erase it

* Notes
  * Establishes that the operator of a search engine is a processor of data under the Directive and could not simply justify its activity through economic interest in processing and it was not protected by language regarding journalism
    * Further, even when the publication of information may have been lawful, the operator could still be required to remove the person’s name from search results
  * Court also found that a person has a strong interest in the right to be forgotten, which often outweighs the economic interest of the operator in running the search engine and the interest of the public in having access to the information
  * Ability to have keep information on the web almost indefinitely a problem. However, the decision poorly addresses it because it only talked about removing links to personal information. Didn’t address requiring information to be removed from the web entirely
  * Responding to the decision, Google set up a web page allowing people to request search removal. Stated that it would balance the rights of the individual against the public’s interest to know and the right to distribute information. Would look at whether the information was outdated and whether there was a public interest in it

* Related Proceedings
  * Highest German court says Google Autocomplete can violate personality rights because it reflects search activity of users and content of web pages; software generates untrue statements of fact
  * Not really about the right to be forgotten because web site still exists
  * The goal is to keep individuals from forming an initial opinion with prejudicing info

### *IMS v. Sorrell* (SCOTUS – 2011)

* Facts:
  * Vermont law restricts sale, disclosure, and use of pharmacy records that reveal prescribing practices of individual doctors
  * Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard medical privacy and diminish the likelihood that marketing will lead to prescription decisions not in the best interest of the patients or the state
  * Issue of free speech in marketing also comes in
  * Case brought by 3 Vermont data miners and an association of pharma manufacturers that produce brand name goods
* Rule: **Prescriber-identifying info is speech for 1A purposes since facts marking beginning point of speech essential for advancement of human knowledge**
* Holding:
  * State cannot engage in content-based discrimination to advance its own side of the debate
  * Privacy is a concept too integral to the person and a right too essential to freedom to allow
  * State “burdened” a form of protected expression that it found “too persuasive” – but the court cannot do this (so the law is unconstitutional)
* Dissent (Breyer):
  * The law is constitutional as the only type of expression being regulated is means of data collection aimed to benefit pharma sales

### GDPR Article 17 - Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten)

* Data subject can request erasure of personal data when:
  * Personal data are no longer necessary
  * Consent is withdrawn
  * Data subject objects and there are no legitimate grounds
  * Processing has been unlawful
  * Erasure is for compliance with legal obligation
* Guidance from Data Protection Board
* Right shall not apply if processing is necessary for:
  * Right of freedom of expression and information
  * Compliance with legal obligation or task in the public interest or in the official authority vested in the controller
  * Reasons of public interest in area of public health
  * Archiving for pub. int., sci., hist. research, stat. purposes
  * Establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims
* Guidance from Data Protection Board
  * Blacklisting/Early Warning Systems and Asset Freezing

### American vs. European Conceptions of Privacy

* **American**
  * Primarily concerned with protection of the home; little focus on media
  * Sovereignty within our own walls
  * Most concerned with deprivations of liberty by the state
  * Home is primary defense and state is primary enemy
  * State action is the biggest issue
* **European**
  * Common to maintain a fundamental right to privacy
  * Continental law of privacy protects dignity and honor broadly
  * Europeans concerned w/ display of consideration for public dignity
  * Historical legacy of Fascism and monarchical societies led to desire for personal honor/dignity
