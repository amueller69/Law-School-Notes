# Private Sector Access

## Origins of the Right To Privacy and Privacy Torts

* Warren and Brandeis' first to call for express "Right to Privacy" tort claim
  * Argued for explicit recognition of the "right to be left alone"
    * While also referring to the "sacred precincts of domestic life" in their article, the intrusion into the home wasn't the threat to privacy they emphasized
    * Instead, they stressed the problem of unwanted publicity about private life as the basis for a privacy tort
    * This would protect the individual's interest in "inviolate personality"

* *De May v. Roberts* (Michigan – 1881)
  * Facts: A doctor and a friend travelled to assist a woman in childbirth. Woman consented to friend’s presence, but later learned he was not a healthcare professional at all , and brought suit
  * Holding: Court held that P **had a legal right to privacy of her apartment at such time** and to be free of any violation thereof. The fact that she consented to the friend's presence does not preclude her from recovering, as failure to disclose full identity/character was deceit and thus a wrong by D which lead to substantial damages from shame and mortification. Accordingly, D is entitled to relief
  * Notes:
    * Here, privacy is characterized as a intimate knowledge of one's physical body, the compromise of a woman's modesty, intrusion into private home life, and a shattering of ones expectation of privacy

### *Manola v. Stevens* (NY 1890)

* Facts: Female stage performer’s manager published a photo of her in tights, and she brought suit for violation that “offended her modesty”
* Holding: Woman entitled to relief
* This case was used by Warren and Brandeis to show that courts were already open to the idea of **protecting privacy against unwanted publicity**
  * Violation of female figure's modesty and autonomy to control use of her likeness was evidence that court has extraordinary willingness to protect individual privacy

### Edwin Godkin, “*The Rights of the Citizen to his Reputation*”

* Defense of privacy with elitist undertones
* Doubted the law could adequately incorporate a right to protecting “so ethereal a quality” as sense of privacy
* Embraced both privacy of the apartment and of unwanted publicity (combines *Roberts* and Warren/Brandeis conceptions of privacy)
* Views privacy as a “luxury of civilization,” previously unknown in “barbarous societies”
  * Element in society **which most contributes to its moral and intellectual growth**
* Right to control information about his thoughts, feelings, and private doings is the same as natural right to decide how much to eat, what to wear, etc.
* Privacy valued more by some individuals than others (e.g., women more than men)

### Warren and Brandeis, “*The Right to Privacy*”

* “That the individual shall have full protection in person and in property is a principle as old as common law, but it has been found necessary from time to time to define anew the exact nature and extent of such protection”
* There is no doubt in the need to protect privacy
  * The intensity and complexity of life have rendered it necessary some retreat from the world and individuals, under the refining influence of culture, have become more sensitive to publicity, making this all the more important
  * Gossip perverts belittles by inverting the relative importance of things, thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of people
  * Gossip is fed by supply/demand – so protections are needed to curb
* “It is our purpose to consider whether existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of an individual, and if so, to what extent and nature”
  * **Common law indicates a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions and sensations, especially in the form of intellectual or artistic property** (property as basis for privacy)
    * It secures the right of determining the extent to which thoughts, sentiments, and emotions shall be communicated to others
    * This should not be dependent on the method or medium of expression adopted (i.e. limited to art, music, etc.)
    * These protections are merely an instance of the more general right to be left alone
    * Since common law indicates such a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions, etc., then **they should receive the same protections**
  * Conclude that privacy rights are not arising from contracts or special trusts, nor the general principle of private property,” but “**rights against the world”**
* Limitations to the right of privacy
  1. Does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest - only those that are unwarranted
      * “Protect those persons with whose affairs the community has no legitimate concern, from being dragged into an undesirable and undesired publicity, and to protect all persons, whatsoever their position or station, from having matters which they may properly prefer to keep private, made public against their will”
  1. Does not prohibit communication of matter when the publication is made under circumstances that render it a “privileged communication according to laws of slander and libel”
  1. Should not grant redress for invasion of privacy by oral publication in absence of special damage
  1. Right to privacy ceases upon publication by the individual or with his consent
  1. Truth of the matter does not afford a defense
      * “It is not for injury to the individual’s character that redress or prevention is sought, but for injury to the right of privacy”
  1. Absence of malice is not a defense
      * Suggested remedies for violation of privacy include: compensation, injunction

### *Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance* (Georgia – 1905)

* Facts: Photo of man used in ad implying that he had purchased that company’s insurance, which he had not
* Holding: The fact that the man is an artist does not establish a waiver of the man’s right to privacy, and using a man’s image without his permission is a serious invasion of one’s right to privacy
  * Court cites numerous bases for right to privacy
    * Natural law - right to live as one will, provided no interference with others
    * Even Romans recognized the importance of providing protection against physical intrusion on privacy
    * Constitutional - e.g. 4th Amendment
    * Precedent - *Manola*
* Other considerations:
  * Right to live a life of seclusion without interference, if one so choses
  * Realization that one's image is being used is to recognize his liberty has been taken away from and he is now under the control of another
    * Difficult question of where this liberty ends of others and the public begins
  * Nothing from which to infer that D waived rights. Mere fact that he is an artist doesn't do this
  * No semblance of an expression that warrants 1A protection

### William Prosser, *Privacy* (California Law Review, 1960)

* Previously, most privacy cases dealt with where there existed a right to privacy – however now able to form some definite conclusions on the topic
* Law of privacy comprises 4 kinds of invasion of 4 different interests of the plaintiff:
  1. Invasion on P’s seclusion or into his private affairs
  1. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about P
  1. Publicity that places P in a false light in the public eye
  1. Appropriation for the D’s advantage of the P’s name or likeness

### Restatement (Second) of Torts – Invasion of Privacy, General Principle (§652A)

1. One who invades the right of privacy of another is subject to liability for the resulting harm to the interests of another
1. The right of privacy is invaded by:
    1. Unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another, as stated in 652B
    1. Appropriation of another’s name or likeness, as stated in 652C
    1. Unreasonable publicity given to the other’s private life, as stated in 652 D, or
    1. Publicity that unreasonable places the other in a false light before the public as stated in 652E

### *Spokeo v. Robins* (2016)

* Facts: Privacy case with grounding in statutory (FCRA) protections. Spokeo (D) operated a “people search engine” enabling users to search for personal information about a subject that is aggregated from many sources. Information it had gathered about P was incorrect. P finds out and files complaint on his own behalf and on behalf of class of similarly situated individuals. District court dismissed for lack of standing. Circuit court reverses on grounds that P's own statutory rights were violated
* Issue: Did the district court err in dismissing Robins’ complaint for lack of standing? Question is one of Article III case or controversy, aka “standing” – which is intended to ensure judiciary is not encroaching
* Holding: Concreteness of injury not necessarily met (does not take its own position on this question). SCOUTS vacates and remands to to Circuit Court for determination of concreteness
* Reasoning:
  * Court applies 3 Part test to determine standing:
    1. There must be **injury in fact**, meaning the injury must be **concrete and particularized**
        * Particularized - Injury must be particular to the individual. Cannot be some generalized grievance
        * Concrete - Some actual or imminent injury to the individual. Although some intangible harms such as risk can be concrete, bare procedural allegations are not
    1. Fairly **traceable to defendant’s challenged conduct**
    1. **Likely to be redressed by favorable decision**
  * The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements. Where a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly allege facts demonstrating each element
  * Court determined that **the dissemination of false information does not necessarily cause concrete injury**
    * Court recognized that while Congress may create a statutory right and “elevate” “intangible harms” that were previously “inadequate at law”, Article III standing requires a concrete injury “even in the context of a statutory violation.”
    * Thus, it does not follow that a person with a bare allegation that a statute was violated can establish Article III standing

## Privacy Torts - Breach of Confidentiality

### *Humphers v. First Interstate Bank* (1985)

* Facts: Closed adoption where biological mother intended to conceal identity from child. Adopted child seeks to contact mother and reaches out to physician that originally delivered her in childbirth for assistance locating her. Physician knowingly gives false statement about biological mother's health so as to justify disclosing sealed health records that would enable daughter to identify her birth mom. Birth mother sues under multiple theories of relief, including breach and invasion
* Reasoning
  * Court distinguishes breach and invasion
    * While both assert right to control information, they depend on different premises. Not every secret concerns personal or private information
    * **Only one who holds information in confidence can be charged with breach of confidence where as an act of tortious invasion of privacy could theoretically be committed by anyone**
    * One theory **recognizes tort of breach of confidence in non-personal confidential relationships**, which would exclude liability for failing to keep secrets among friends and family
      * May be difficulty identifying such relationships. Some commentators suggest the **duty arises in all non-personal relationships "customarily understood" to carry such an obligation**
  * Clear legal constraints that impose such obligations and no privilege of the doctor can allow him to disregard it
* Notes:
  * Strengths of case: Sensitive data, statutory backing, behavior of disclosure, irreversible consequences
  * Challenges in breach of confidentiality: Absence of a statue and problem of appropriate remedy

### *Morris v. Consolidation Coal* (1994 WV)

* Facts: P was injured in workplace accident and is examined by a physician attempting to get worker's compensation. Company (D) goes to physician and shows him videos of P working after injury without showing any signs of it. Physician wrote Worker's Comp a letter stating he is unable to verify D's injuries. Company suspends and ultimately discharge P from work pursuant to CBA. P files suit against both physician and company for breach of and interfering with confidential relationship, respectively.
* Issue: Did conduct of physician or company violate confidential relationship?
* Holding: P has valid claim against physician for breach of confidentiality. Also a claim against company for inducing breach if elements of test are met
* Reasoning:
  * Court recognizes validity of ex parte contact with claimant physician in order to expeditiously resolve injury claims, however this communication is limited to the information contained in the written medical reports or other routine inquiries which do not exchange confidential information
  * **While disapproving of fraud, court says this is still not sufficient to ignore principles that prohibit unauthorized ex parte communication between employer and physician**
    * There were proper ways to submit evidence of fraud to Worker's Compensation Fund without unauthorized communication
    * Purpose of this prohibition is to prevent disclosure of confidential information in the first place
    * Patient did not waive this right, thus confidentiality was breached
  * Court holds **there is a claim against third party for inducing breach if:**
    1. Third party knew or should have known about privileged relationship
    1. Third party intended to or should have reasonable known that his conduct would induce physician to wrongfully disclose
    1. Third party did not reasonably believe physician could disclose without violation
    1. Physician does in fact disclose such information

### *Bagent v. Blessing Care* (2007 IL)

* Facts: Tort claim based on HIPAA. Employee of D conducts blood work that reveal P's pregnancy. Outside of work, employee inadvertently reveals to P's sister, a friend, about the news and immediately backtracks after realizing what she had done. Hospital is sued for employee's actions under theory of respondeat superior. Employee also sued in individual capacity.
* Issue: Who is liable under what circumstances? (scope of employment question)
* Holding: Summary judgement in favor of hospital is affirmed
* Reasoning:
  * **An act is outside of the scope of employment if it has no connection with the conduct the employee is required to perform**
    * However, employer can't avoid vicariously liability for act within employee's scope of employment merely by telling them to act carefully
    * **The fact that hospital expressly prohibited the act supports finding that the prohibited act is outside scope of employment**
    * Employee was in no way attempting to serve her employer in disclosing the information, she merely incorrectly assumed that sister had already known 

## Privacy Tort - Psychotherapist-Patient Relationships

* **Tarasoff Rule**
  * Therapists are expected to keep patients' secrets, though required by state law to report child abuse/neglect that they learn about
  * State law might also impose requirement that therapist report to potential victims evidence that a patient has imminent plans to commit murder or other serious harm
    * Comes from *Tarasoff v. University of California*, which established rule of negligence liability which imposed civil duty of care
    * Thus, **mental healthcare providers are expected to warn third parties of threats patients make to inflict serious bodily harm to others**

### *Jaffee v. Redmond* (1996)

* Facts - On-duty police officer (Redmond) responds to an incident and shot (and killed) a man whom she claimed brandished a knife and chased another person. Estate brings a §1983 claim against Redmond. In discovery, it is revealed that Redmond had participated in several counseling sessions with a clinical social worker. Records of these sessions are requested by P to the objection of both Redmond and the therapist. After resisting discovery, judge instructs jury to presume contents of these records would be unfavorable to Redmond
* Issue: Can privilege baed on a confidential relationship be asserted here? **Does confidentiality in this relationship promote sufficient interests that outweigh the need for probative evidence?**
* Holding: Yes, Court held that there is a protected psychotherapist-patient privilege in court
* Reasoning:
  * Court acknowledges fundamental maxim serving as foundation for discovery ("that the public has the right to every man's evidence"), though recognized that exceptions exist and are justified by a public good which outweigh that general principle
  * Psychotherapist-patient privilege is rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust. Necessary for effective treatment, which depend upon patient willingness to make frank and complete disclosures of facts, emotions, thoughts, etc.
  * **The mere possibility of disclosure may impede development of the confidential relationship needed for successful treatment**
  * Mental health is a public good of transcendant importance and evidentiary benefit of denying privilege would be modest
* Scalia Dissent
  * Majority position comes at significant cost of occasional injustice
  * Not clear to him that denying privilege would be unacceptable state of affairs and there is a slippery slope in extending this privilege on this basis

### Moravek v. US (2008 SC)

* Facts: P tells psychiatrist he is thinking about going to courthouse, where he is scheduled for appearance, and taking out secret service agents. Psychiatrist discusses with hospital counsel, who makes inquiry with federal court. US attorney's office subsequently requires records, which leads to arrest warrant being issued. P seeks damages on several theories. State of S.C. limited in what it recognizes, so no tort for disclosure to one or a few people
* Issue: Does P have right to relief on any of the causes of action?
* Holding: No. Summary judgement granted in favor of D.
* Reasoning:
  * Court recognizes exception to privilege identified by SCOTUS in *Jaffee* where serious threat of harm to patient or others can be averted by therapist
  * No invasion of privacy under any of the recognized torts in state of SC
  * Applying *Tarasoff*, a special relationship exists where D has the ability to monitor/supervise/control an individual's conduct and this is the basis for duty to warn potential victims when specific threat of harm is directed at them
  * **Must be a specific threat to harm a readily identifiable third party**. Here, this is satisfied as the place, time, nd parties wer all identified

### Gracey v. Eaker (2002 FL)

* Facts: Couple sues psychotherapist who sabotaged their marriage by informing each one what the other had said in individual therapy sessions. Bring claim for emotional damages that have resulted from the fallout of their marriage
* Holding - Court rules that P's have properly stated recognized claim
* Reasoning
  * Impact rule inapplicable in fiduciary duty and statutory cases where duty of  confidentiality was breached
    * Impact rule requires emotional damages in negligence action demonstrate that emotional distress flowed from physical injuries sustained in an impact
    * Intended to keep from opening the floodgates of purely emotional damage cases
    * Exceptions to this rule are recognized torts where damages tend to be mostly emotional (e.g. defamation, invasion of privacy, etc)

## Statutory Law and Fair Information Principles

* Regulation is sectoral: some sectors escape regulation, such as e-commerce and social media
* Concerns over stifling information flows, innovation, and growth of self-regulation

### Fair Information Principles or Practices

* Have powerfully influenced the development of modern privacy law. They define rights and responsibilities and aim to correct information asymmetries in the collection and use of personal data
* Can be viewed as a set of practical guidelines for constraining the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal data
  * Creators intended a body of enforceable standards similar to Fair Labor Standards, as opposed to an articulation of high level aspirational principles
  * Original FIPs and OECD guidelines noticeably omitted Notice and Choice. These two "principles" seem to be at odds with original purpose of FIPs of establishing ongoing obligations associated with data collection of use. These simply operate as a waiver/disclaimer, a mechanism to obtain consent for the use of personal data
* The original 5 (1973):
  * Openness - No secret personal-data recordkeeping; no secret systems
  * Individual Access - Individuals must be able to access info stored and know how it is being used
  * Individual Participation - Person must be able to correct or amend the substance of information maintained about them
  * Use Limitation - Limit types of info collected and prevent info obtained for one purpose being used for another without individual’s consent
  * Use Limitation - Ensure data reliability and limitations for intended use and take reasonable precautions to prevent data misuse
* OECD Guidelines add 3 more (1980):
  * Disclosure limitation - Limits on external disclosures of information about the individual
  * Information Management - Responsibility for establishing reasonable/proper polices and practices which assure lawful and necessary use of data collection, use, and sharing and that information is current/accurate
  * Accountability - Organization accountable for its personal-data record-keeping policies, practices, and systems
* Today’s Fair Information Principles or Practices
  * Notice – transparency value; individuals know what info others have; institutions must assess data
  * Appropriate or Expected Use – blocks off choice and gives areas for use
  * Choice – opt-in (not shared w/o consent) versus opt-out (shared unless otherwise requested)
  * Other Uses and Policy Priorities – doesn’t benefit person, but good for society (i.e. health outbreak)
  * Access and Amendment or Correction – correct and review information maintained
  * Minimization – limit who can see info; only get what you need
  * Security and Breach Notification
  * Enforcement – make sure privacy laws are being followed
* Privacy by Design - Goes beyond the FIPs ("raises the bar"). Presents top-down design-thinking approach to privacy, can be viewed as reference framework for more building more detailed criteria
  * **Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial** - Activities that seek to avoid or reduce risk before it arises rather than respond to it (e.g. centralized governance, external stakeholder engagement, identifying deficient practices, etc.)
  * **Privacy as the Default** - Minimize collection and usage to that which is necessary, maximum amount of privacy afforded to users by default
  * **Privacy Embedded into Design** - Integrate privacy into development lifecycle, change management, and process design
  * **Full Functionality** - Not a zero sum approach, no unnecessary tradeoffs between privacy and functionality (easier said than done)
  * **End-to-End Security** - Protection throughout entire data lifecycle without gaps in accountability
  * **Visibility and Transparency** - Readily available and well defined practices/standards and assurance that they are operating/adhered to as intended (i.e. independent verification)
  * **Respect for User Privacy** - Building a culture of privacy. Concern for user privacy is always at the forefront and guides decisions

### Federal Record-Keeping Privacy Statutes

* **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)**
  * All persons have right to inspect and copy records and documents maintained by any federal agency, federal corporation, or federal department.
  * Notable Exemptions:
    * (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
    * (7)(C) Records or info compiled for law enforcement purposes…which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
* **Privacy Act of 1974**
  * Justification:
    * Individual privacy is affected directly by collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by Federal agencies
    * Thereat to privacy magnified by increasingly sophisticated technology
    * Opportunity for employment, insurance, and credit, right to due process, and other protections are endangered by misuse of certain information systems
    * Right to privacy is a fundamental right protected by constitution
    * Necessary and proper to regulate such activities in order to protect privacy
  * Does the following:
    * Permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by federal agencies.
    * Permit an individual to prevent records pertaining to him obtained by such agencies for a particular purpose from being used or made available for another purpose without his consent.
    * Allow an individual to access and correct his personal data maintained by federal agencies.
    * Ensure that information is current and accurate for its intended use, and that adequate safeguards are provide to prevent misuse of such information.
* Applicability and Scope
  * Applies to federal agencies, not to state or local agencies, or business or private sector organizations
  * Applies only to information about an individual that is part of a federal "record" or "maintained" in a "system of records"
  * Any alleged violation must show that agency breached duty imposed by act, information must have been identifiable and contained within federal record system, and adverse impact resulted from violation and was willful and intentional

### *United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press* (1989)

* Facts: The FBI maintains a database of criminal rap sheets. CBS reporter seeks FBI rap sheets of a private family, which controlled a company that seemed to be a front for criminal activity, through a FOIA request. The rap sheet compiles lots of public records about the individual in one place. The argument was that information of the rap sheet was publicly available through different sources, so there was no privacy interest
* Issue: Is the individual privacy interest at stake the type Congress intended to protect with exemptions from the FOIA?
* Holding: Court grants DOJ summary judgement because FOIA has an exception for violations of personal privacy. FOIA was established to provide transparency into government activities for the public, not to violate the privacy of individuals. This is an unwarranted invasion of privacy
* Reasoning
  * FOIA identifies 9 exemptions to the broad disclosure requirements, including 7(C) which excludes records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, "but only to the extent that the production of such...could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."
  * Privacy is about the individual’s control over information relating to himself or herself
    * There is a privacy interest in keeping facts out of the public eye and just because an event is not wholly private, it does not follow that there is not some privacy interest
    * Difference between going out and getting information from different sources (no privacy interest) and getting it from a centralized location (privacy interest)
      * Substantial privacy interest in the information of a rap sheet because it provides an easy means of accessing information that previously would have been forgotten
      * Similar to argument about surveillance in *Jones*
  * The release of information under the FOIA was meant to further public scrutiny of the government. This interest is not served by disclosing information about private individuals, but which reveals little or nothing about an agency’s conduct
    * While there is some public interest into the activity of the family, it falls outside of the scope of the FOIA
  * “A third party’s request for law enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen’s privacy, and that when the request seeks no official information about a Government agency, but merely records that the Government happens to be storing, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.”
* Concurrence: Doesn’t like the broad rule established. Thinks that the disclosure of a rap sheet could be justified in certain instances, e.g. when it involves a candidate for public office.
* Notes:
  * Mosaic theory: bits and pieces combine to provide a wealth of information
  * Practical obscurity: just because info is out there doesn’t mean it is readily available
  * This case is pre-Google; now, value is in true and accurate information as
  * Think about the difference between transfers of information between the government and private persons vs. intra-government [catching criminals and those defrauding gov’t]
