# Private Sector Access

## Origins of the Right To Privacy and Privacy Torts

* Warren and Brandeis' first to call for express "Right to Privacy" tort claim
  * Argued for explicit recognition of the "right to be left alone"
    * While also referring to the "sacred precincts of domestic life" in their article, the intrusion into the home wasn't the threat to privacy they emphasized
    * Instead, they stressed the problem of unwanted publicity about private life as the basis for a privacy tort
    * This would protect the individual's interest in "inviolate personality"

* *De May v. Roberts* (Michigan – 1881)
  * Facts: A doctor and a friend travelled to assist a woman in childbirth. Woman consented to friend’s presence, but later learned he was not a healthcare professional at all , and brought suit
  * Holding: Court held that P **had a legal right to privacy of her apartment at such time** and to be free of any violation thereof. The fact that she consented to the friend's presence does not preclude her from recovering, as failure to disclose full identity/character was deceit and thus a wrong by D which lead to substantial damages from shame and mortification. Accordingly, D is entitled to relief
  * Notes:
    * Here, privacy is characterized as a intimate knowledge of one's physical body, the compromise of a woman's modesty, intrusion into private home life, and a shattering of ones expectation of privacy

### *Manola v. Stevens* (NY 1890)

* Facts: Female stage performer’s manager published a photo of her in tights, and she brought suit for violation that “offended her modesty”
* Holding: Woman entitled to relief
* This case was used by Warren and Brandeis to show that courts were already open to the idea of **protecting privacy against unwanted publicity**
  * Violation of female figure's modesty and autonomy to control use of her likeness was evidence that court has extraordinary willingness to protect individual privacy

### Edwin Godkin, “*The Rights of the Citizen to his Reputation*”

* Defense of privacy with elitist undertones
* Doubted the law could adequately incorporate a right to protecting “so ethereal a quality” as sense of privacy
* Embraced both privacy of the apartment and of unwanted publicity (combines *Roberts* and Warren/Brandeis conceptions of privacy)
* Views privacy as a “luxury of civilization,” previously unknown in “barbarous societies”
  * Element in society **which most contributes to its moral and intellectual growth**
* Right to control information about his thoughts, feelings, and private doings is the same as natural right to decide how much to eat, what to wear, etc
* Privacy valued more by some individuals than others (e.g., women more than men)

### Warren and Brandeis, “*The Right to Privacy*”

* “That the individual shall have full protection in person and in property is a principle as old as common law, but it has been found necessary from time to time to define anew the exact nature and extent of such protection”
* There is no doubt in the need to protect privacy
  * The intensity and complexity of life have rendered it necessary some retreat from the world and individuals, under the refining influence of culture, have become more sensitive to publicity, making this all the more important
  * Gossip perverts belittles by inverting the relative importance of things, thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of people
  * Gossip is fed by supply/demand – so protections are needed to curb
* “It is our purpose to consider whether existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of an individual, and if so, to what extent and nature”
  * **Common law indicates a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions and sensations, especially in the form of intellectual or artistic property** (property as basis for privacy)
    * It secures the right of determining the extent to which thoughts, sentiments, and emotions shall be communicated to others
    * This should not be dependent on the method or medium of expression adopted (i.e. limited to art, music, etc.)
    * These protections are merely an instance of the more general right to be left alone
    * Since common law indicates such a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions, etc., then **they should receive the same protections**
  * Conclude that privacy rights are not arising from contracts or special trusts, nor the general principle of private property,” but “**rights against the world”**
* Limitations to the right of privacy
  1. Does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest - only those that are unwarranted
      * “Protect those persons with whose affairs the community has no legitimate concern, from being dragged into an undesirable and undesired publicity, and to protect all persons, whatsoever their position or station, from having matters which they may properly prefer to keep private, made public against their will”
  1. Does not prohibit communication of matter when the publication is made under circumstances that render it a “privileged communication according to laws of slander and libel”
  1. Should not grant redress for invasion of privacy by oral publication in absence of special damage
  1. Right to privacy ceases upon publication by the individual or with his consent
  1. Truth of the matter does not afford a defense
      * “It is not for injury to the individual’s character that redress or prevention is sought, but for injury to the right of privacy”
  1. Absence of malice is not a defense
      * Suggested remedies for violation of privacy include: compensation, injunction

### *Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance* (Georgia – 1905)

* Facts: Photo of man used in ad implying that he had purchased that company’s insurance, which he had not
* Holding: The fact that the man is an artist does not establish a waiver of the man’s right to privacy, and using a man’s image without his permission is a serious invasion of one’s right to privacy
  * Court cites numerous bases for right to privacy
    * Natural law - right to live as one will, provided no interference with others
    * Even Romans recognized the importance of providing protection against physical intrusion on privacy
    * Constitutional - e.g. 4th Amendment
    * Precedent - *Manola*
* Other considerations:
  * Right to live a life of seclusion without interference, if one so choses
  * Realization that one's image is being used is to recognize his liberty has been taken away from and he is now under the control of another
    * Difficult question of where this liberty ends of others and the public begins
  * Nothing from which to infer that D waived rights. Mere fact that he is an artist doesn't do this
  * No semblance of an expression that warrants 1A protection

### William Prosser, *Privacy* (California Law Review, 1960)

* Previously, most privacy cases dealt with where there existed a right to privacy – however now able to form some definite conclusions on the topic
* Law of privacy comprises 4 kinds of invasion of 4 different interests of the plaintiff:
  1. Invasion on P’s seclusion or into his private affairs
  1. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about P
  1. Publicity that places P in a false light in the public eye
  1. Appropriation for the D’s advantage of the P’s name or likeness

### Restatement (Second) of Torts – Invasion of Privacy, General Principle (§652A)

1. One who invades the right of privacy of another is subject to liability for the resulting harm to the interests of another
1. The right of privacy is invaded by:
    1. Unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another, as stated in 652B
    1. Appropriation of another’s name or likeness, as stated in 652C
    1. Unreasonable publicity given to the other’s private life, as stated in 652 D, or
    1. Publicity that unreasonable places the other in a false light before the public as stated in 652E

### *Spokeo v. Robins* (2016)

* Facts: Privacy case with grounding in statutory (FCRA) protections. Spokeo (D) operated a “people search engine” enabling users to search for personal information about a subject that is aggregated from many sources. Information it had gathered about P was incorrect. P finds out and files complaint on his own behalf and on behalf of class of similarly situated individuals. District court dismissed for lack of standing. Circuit court reverses on grounds that P's own statutory rights were violated
* Issue: Did the district court err in dismissing Robins’ complaint for lack of standing? Question is one of Article III case or controversy, aka “standing” – which is intended to ensure judiciary is not encroaching
* Holding: Concreteness of injury not necessarily met (does not take its own position on this question). SCOUTS vacates and remands to to Circuit Court for determination of concreteness
* Reasoning:
  * Court applies 3 Part test to determine standing:
    1. There must be **injury in fact**, meaning the injury must be **concrete and particularized**
        * Particularized - Injury must be particular to the individual. Cannot be some generalized grievance
        * Concrete - Some actual or imminent injury to the individual. Although some intangible harms such as risk can be concrete, bare procedural allegations are not
    1. Fairly **traceable to defendant’s challenged conduct**
    1. **Likely to be redressed by favorable decision**
  * The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements. Where a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly allege facts demonstrating each element
  * Court determined that **the dissemination of false information does not necessarily cause concrete injury**
    * Court recognized that while Congress may create a statutory right and “elevate” “intangible harms” that were previously “inadequate at law”, Article III standing requires a concrete injury “even in the context of a statutory violation.”
    * Thus, it does not follow that a person with a bare allegation that a statute was violated can establish Article III standing

## Privacy Torts - Breach of Confidentiality

### *Humphers v. First Interstate Bank* (1985)

* Facts: Closed adoption where biological mother intended to conceal identity from child. Adopted child seeks to contact mother and reaches out to physician that originally delivered her in childbirth for assistance locating her. Physician knowingly gives false statement about biological mother's health so as to justify disclosing sealed health records that would enable daughter to identify her birth mom. Birth mother sues under multiple theories of relief, including breach and invasion
* Reasoning
  * Court distinguishes breach and invasion
    * While both assert right to control information, they depend on different premises. Not every secret concerns personal or private information
    * **Only one who holds information in confidence can be charged with breach of confidence where as an act of tortious invasion of privacy could theoretically be committed by anyone**
    * One theory **recognizes tort of breach of confidence in non-personal confidential relationships**, which would exclude liability for failing to keep secrets among friends and family
      * May be difficulty identifying such relationships. Some commentators suggest the **duty arises in all non-personal relationships "customarily understood" to carry such an obligation**
  * Clear legal constraints that impose such obligations and no privilege of the doctor can allow him to disregard it
* Notes:
  * Strengths of case: Sensitive data, statutory backing, behavior of disclosure, irreversible consequences
  * Challenges in breach of confidentiality: Absence of a statue and problem of appropriate remedy

### *Morris v. Consolidation Coal* (1994 WV)

* Facts: P was injured in workplace accident and is examined by a physician attempting to get worker's compensation. Company (D) goes to physician and shows him videos of P working after injury without showing any signs of it. Physician wrote Worker's Comp a letter stating he is unable to verify D's injuries. Company suspends and ultimately discharge P from work pursuant to CBA. P files suit against both physician and company for breach of and interfering with confidential relationship, respectively
* Issue: Did conduct of physician or company violate confidential relationship?
* Holding: P has valid claim against physician for breach of confidentiality. Also a claim against company for inducing breach if elements of test are met
* Reasoning:
  * Court recognizes validity of ex parte contact with claimant physician in order to expeditiously resolve injury claims, however this communication is limited to the information contained in the written medical reports or other routine inquiries which do not exchange confidential information
  * **While disapproving of fraud, court says this is still not sufficient to ignore principles that prohibit unauthorized ex parte communication between employer and physician**
    * There were proper ways to submit evidence of fraud to Worker's Compensation Fund without unauthorized communication
    * Purpose of this prohibition is to prevent disclosure of confidential information in the first place
    * Patient did not waive this right, thus confidentiality was breached
  * Court holds **there is a claim against third party for inducing breach if:**
    1. Third party knew or should have known about privileged relationship
    1. Third party intended to or should have reasonable known that his conduct would induce physician to wrongfully disclose
    1. Third party did not reasonably believe physician could disclose without violation
    1. Physician does in fact disclose such information

### *Bagent v. Blessing Care* (2007 IL)

* Facts: Tort claim based on HIPAA. Employee of D conducts blood work that reveal P's pregnancy. Outside of work, employee inadvertently reveals to P's sister, a friend, about the news and immediately backtracks after realizing what she had done. Hospital is sued for employee's actions under theory of respondeat superior. Employee also sued in individual capacity
* Issue: Who is liable under what circumstances? (scope of employment question)
* Holding: Summary judgement in favor of hospital is affirmed
* Reasoning:
  * **An act is outside of the scope of employment if it has no connection with the conduct the employee is required to perform**
    * However, employer can't avoid vicariously liability for act within employee's scope of employment merely by telling them to act carefully
    * **The fact that hospital expressly prohibited the act supports finding that the prohibited act is outside scope of employment**
    * Employee was in no way attempting to serve her employer in disclosing the information, she merely incorrectly assumed that sister had already known

## Privacy Tort - Psychotherapist-Patient Relationships

* **Tarasoff Rule**
  * Therapists are expected to keep patients' secrets, though required by state law to report child abuse/neglect that they learn about
  * State law might also impose requirement that therapist report to potential victims evidence that a patient has imminent plans to commit murder or other serious harm
    * Comes from *Tarasoff v. University of California*, which established rule of negligence liability which imposed civil duty of care
    * Thus, **mental healthcare providers are expected to warn third parties of threats patients make to inflict serious bodily harm to others**

### *Jaffee v. Redmond* (1996)

* Facts - On-duty police officer (Redmond) responds to an incident and shot (and killed) a man whom she claimed brandished a knife and chased another person. Estate brings a §1983 claim against Redmond. In discovery, it is revealed that Redmond had participated in several counseling sessions with a clinical social worker. Records of these sessions are requested by P to the objection of both Redmond and the therapist. After resisting discovery, judge instructs jury to presume contents of these records would be unfavorable to Redmond
* Issue: Can privilege baed on a confidential relationship be asserted here? **Does confidentiality in this relationship promote sufficient interests that outweigh the need for probative evidence?**
* Holding: Yes, Court held that there is a protected psychotherapist-patient privilege in court
* Reasoning:
  * Court acknowledges fundamental maxim serving as foundation for discovery ("that the public has the right to every man's evidence"), though recognized that exceptions exist and are justified by a public good which outweigh that general principle
  * Psychotherapist-patient privilege is rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust. Necessary for effective treatment, which depend upon patient willingness to make frank and complete disclosures of facts, emotions, thoughts, etc
  * **The mere possibility of disclosure may impede development of the confidential relationship needed for successful treatment**
  * Mental health is a public good of transcendant importance and evidentiary benefit of denying privilege would be modest
* Scalia Dissent
  * Majority position comes at significant cost of occasional injustice
  * Not clear to him that denying privilege would be unacceptable state of affairs and there is a slippery slope in extending this privilege on this basis

### Moravek v. US (2008 SC)

* Facts: P tells psychiatrist he is thinking about going to courthouse, where he is scheduled for appearance, and taking out secret service agents. Psychiatrist discusses with hospital counsel, who makes inquiry with federal court. US attorney's office subsequently requires records, which leads to arrest warrant being issued. P seeks damages on several theories. State of S.C. limited in what it recognizes, so no tort for disclosure to one or a few people
* Issue: Does P have right to relief on any of the causes of action?
* Holding: No. Summary judgement granted in favor of D
* Reasoning:
  * Court recognizes exception to privilege identified by SCOTUS in *Jaffee* where serious threat of harm to patient or others can be averted by therapist
  * No invasion of privacy under any of the recognized torts in state of SC
  * Applying *Tarasoff*, a special relationship exists where D has the ability to monitor/supervise/control an individual's conduct and this is the basis for duty to warn potential victims when specific threat of harm is directed at them
  * **Must be a specific threat to harm a readily identifiable third party**. Here, this is satisfied as the place, time, nd parties wer all identified

### Gracey v. Eaker (2002 FL)

* Facts: Couple sues psychotherapist who sabotaged their marriage by informing each one what the other had said in individual therapy sessions. Bring claim for emotional damages that have resulted from the fallout of their marriage
* Holding - Court rules that P's have properly stated recognized claim
* Reasoning
  * Impact rule inapplicable in fiduciary duty and statutory cases where duty of  confidentiality was breached
    * Impact rule requires emotional damages in negligence action demonstrate that emotional distress flowed from physical injuries sustained in an impact
    * Intended to keep from opening the floodgates of purely emotional damage cases
    * Exceptions to this rule are recognized torts where damages tend to be mostly emotional (e.g. defamation, invasion of privacy, etc)

## Statutory Law and Fair Information Principles

* Regulation is sectoral: some sectors escape regulation, such as e-commerce and social media
* Concerns over stifling information flows, innovation, and growth of self-regulation

### Fair Information Principles or Practices

* Have powerfully influenced the development of modern privacy law. They define rights and responsibilities and aim to correct information asymmetries in the collection and use of personal data
* Can be viewed as a set of practical guidelines for constraining the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal data
  * Creators intended a body of enforceable standards similar to Fair Labor Standards, as opposed to an articulation of high level aspirational principles
  * Original FIPs and OECD guidelines noticeably omitted Notice and Choice. These two "principles" seem to be at odds with original purpose of FIPs of establishing ongoing obligations associated with data collection of use. These simply operate as a waiver/disclaimer, a mechanism to obtain consent for the use of personal data
  
* The original 5 (1973):
  * Openness - No secret personal-data recordkeeping; no secret systems
  * Individual Access - Individuals must be able to access info stored and know how it is being used
  * Individual Participation - Person must be able to correct or amend the substance of information maintained about them
  * Use Limitation - Limit types of info collected and prevent info obtained for one purpose being used for another without individual’s consent
  * Use Limitation - Ensure data reliability and limitations for intended use and take reasonable precautions to prevent data misuse
  
* OECD Guidelines add 3 more (1980):
  * Disclosure limitation - Limits on external disclosures of information about the individual
  * Information Management - Responsibility for establishing reasonable/proper polices and practices which assure lawful and necessary use of data collection, use, and sharing and that information is current/accurate
  * Accountability - Organization accountable for its personal-data record-keeping policies, practices, and systems
* Today’s Fair Information Principles or Practices
  * Notice – transparency value; individuals know what info others have; institutions must assess data
  * Appropriate or Expected Use – blocks off choice and gives areas for use
  * Choice – opt-in (not shared w/o consent) versus opt-out (shared unless otherwise requested)
  * Other Uses and Policy Priorities – doesn’t benefit person, but good for society (i.e. health outbreak)
  * Access and Amendment or Correction – correct and review information maintained
  * Minimization – limit who can see info; only get what you need
  * Security and Breach Notification
  * Enforcement – make sure privacy laws are being followed
  
* Privacy by Design - Goes beyond the FIPs ("raises the bar"). Presents top-down design-thinking approach to privacy, can be viewed as reference framework for more building more detailed criteria
  * **Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial** - Activities that seek to avoid or reduce risk before it arises rather than respond to it (e.g. centralized governance, external stakeholder engagement, identifying deficient practices, etc.)
  * **Privacy as the Default** - Minimize collection and usage to that which is necessary, maximum amount of privacy afforded to users by default
  * **Privacy Embedded into Design** - Integrate privacy into development lifecycle, change management, and process design
  * **Full Functionality** - Not a zero sum approach, no unnecessary tradeoffs between privacy and functionality (easier said than done)
  * **End-to-End Security** - Protection throughout entire data lifecycle without gaps in accountability
  * **Visibility and Transparency** - Readily available and well defined practices/standards and assurance that they are operating/adhered to as intended (i.e. independent verification)
  * **Respect for User Privacy** - Building a culture of privacy. Concern for user privacy is always at the forefront and guides decisions

### Federal Record-Keeping Privacy Statutes

* **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)**
  * All persons have right to inspect and copy records and documents maintained by any federal agency, federal corporation, or federal department
  * Notable Exemptions:
    * (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
    * (7)(C) Records or info compiled for law enforcement purposes…which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
  
* **Privacy Act of 1974**
  * Justification:
    * Individual privacy is affected directly by collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by Federal agencies
    * Thereat to privacy magnified by increasingly sophisticated technology
    * Opportunity for employment, insurance, and credit, right to due process, and other protections are endangered by misuse of certain information systems
    * Right to privacy is a fundamental right protected by constitution
    * Necessary and proper to regulate such activities in order to protect privacy
  * Does the following:
    * Permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by federal agencies
    * Permit an individual to prevent records pertaining to him obtained by such agencies for a particular purpose from being used or made available for another purpose without his consent
    * Allow an individual to access and correct his personal data maintained by federal agencies
    * Ensure that information is current and accurate for its intended use, and that adequate safeguards are provide to prevent misuse of such information
  
* Applicability and Scope
  * Applies to federal agencies, not to state or local agencies, or business or private sector organizations
  * Applies only to information about an individual that is part of a federal "record" or "maintained" in a "system of records"
  * Any alleged violation must show that agency breached duty imposed by act, information must have been identifiable and contained within federal record system, and adverse impact resulted from violation and was willful and intentional

### *United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press* (1989)

* Facts: The FBI maintains a database of criminal rap sheets. CBS reporter seeks FBI rap sheets of a private family, which controlled a company that seemed to be a front for criminal activity, through a FOIA request. The rap sheet compiles lots of public records about the individual in one place. The argument was that information of the rap sheet was publicly available through different sources, so there was no privacy interest
* Issue: Is the individual privacy interest at stake the type Congress intended to protect with exemptions from the FOIA?
* Holding: Court grants DOJ summary judgement because FOIA has an exception for violations of personal privacy. FOIA was established to provide transparency into government activities for the public, not to violate the privacy of individuals. This is an unwarranted invasion of privacy
* Reasoning
  * FOIA identifies 9 exemptions to the broad disclosure requirements, including 7(C) which excludes records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, "but only to the extent that the production of such...could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."
  * Privacy is about the individual’s control over information relating to himself or herself
    * There is a privacy interest in keeping facts out of the public eye and just because an event is not wholly private, it does not follow that there is not some privacy interest
    * Difference between going out and getting information from different sources (no privacy interest) and getting it from a centralized location (privacy interest)
      * Substantial privacy interest in the information of a rap sheet because it provides an easy means of accessing information that previously would have been forgotten
      * Similar to argument about surveillance in *Jones*
  * The release of information under the FOIA was meant to further public scrutiny of the government. This interest is not served by disclosing information about private individuals, but which reveals little or nothing about an agency’s conduct
    * While there is some public interest into the activity of the family, it falls outside of the scope of the FOIA
  * “A third party’s request for law enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen’s privacy, and that when the request seeks no official information about a Government agency, but merely records that the Government happens to be storing, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.”
* Concurrence: Doesn’t like the broad rule established. Thinks that the disclosure of a rap sheet could be justified in certain instances, e.g. when it involves a candidate for public office
* Notes:
  * Mosaic theory: bits and pieces combine to provide a wealth of information
  * Practical obscurity: just because info is out there doesn’t mean it is readily available
  * This case is pre-Google; now, value is in true and accurate information as
  * Think about the difference between transfers of information between the government and private persons vs. intra-government (catching criminals and those defrauding the government)

## HIPAA

* Medical information is perceived as one of the most sensitive types of information. Disclosure of this information can lead to discomfort, embarrassment and discrimination. Confidentiality of the patient-provider relationship encourages people to seek vital medical attention and to be honest about their health concerns
* State statutes and tort law had historically provided remedies for breach of this information, though federal medical privacy laws are a more recent development

### HIPAA Overview

* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed in 1996
  * Main purpose was designed to facilitate portability of health information between providers, payers, etc
  * Privacy/confidentiality concerns implicated in promoting transmission of health information, thus a section of HIPAA intended to address this
  * Through HIPAA, Congress delegated authority to enact national data privacy and security standards to HHS. HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for implementing and enforcing privacy rules
    * Act authorized HHS secretary to provide recommendations on national health privacy standards and if Congress failed to pass federal health privacy legislation by 1999, HHS would be authorized to promulgate its own standards
    * Congress failed to pass legislation before deadline, thus HHS promulgated its own standards through administrative rule making process
* Amended through HITECH Act in 2009 to: strengthen individual level of control over information; broaden definition of covered entities; increase duties of business associates; create new breach notification obligations; add restriction on sale and marketing of health information; require development of new guidelines regarding limited and de-identified data sets; and increase violation penalties and add no enforcement provisions
  * Under broadened post-HITECH definitions, a breach occurs if there is unpermitted access, use, or disclosure of PHI unless low probability of PHI compromise
    * Nature and extent of PHI involved – likelihood of re-identification
    * Unauthorized person or to whom PHI was disclosed
    * PHI actually acquired or just viewed
* Preemption - HIPAA only a baseline of privacy protections. States can and almost do have more stringent requirements
  * HIPAA expressly provides that it not supercede any provision of state law related if it imposes more stringent requirements
  
### HIPAA Scope

* HIPAA privacy rule applies to **covered entities**, which includes:
  * Health plans: An individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of, medical care
  * Health care clearinghouse: A public or private entity that processes health information received from other entities into various formats
  * Health care provider: Provider of medical or health services and any other person or organization who furnishes, bills, or is paid for health care in the normal course of business
  * Note: Definition of "covered entity" does not extend to public health/free clinics or pharmacies. These are the two most notable omissions, though this does not appear to be an intentional carve out
  * Note: This is also contingent on

* Covered entities are prohibited from using or disclosing **individually identifiable protected health information** without consent, except as provided in the rule. This information is defined as:
  * > Any information...in any form or medium, that is created or received by a \[covered entity\], public health authority, employer, life insurer, \[or\] school or university...and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of any individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and that identifies the individual or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual
  * Thus, to fall under protection of HIPAA:
    1. Must relate to past/present/future health condition, provision of health care, or payment for provision
    1. Does or reasonably could identify an individual
  
* A **business associate** (BA) is any person or entity that, on behalf of a covered entity, creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA, including claims processing or administration, data analysis, processing or administration, utilization review, quality assurance, patient safety activities, billing, benefit management, practice management, and repricing. However, persons or organizations are not considered business associates if their functions or services do not involve the use or disclosure of protected health information
  * In order to be covered by HIPAA, a BA must have entered into business associate agreement
  * The HITECH Act makes business associates directly liable for compliance with certain aspects of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and makes these entities subject to HIPAA and HHS enforcement
    * Subcontractors now considered BAs and subject to the same HHS enforcement
    * Ensures that the privacy and security protections of the HIPAA rules extend beyond covered entities to those entities that create or receive protected health information in order for the covered entity to perform is health care functions
  
* There are no restrictions on the use or disclosure of **de-identified health information**, which neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual
  * De-Identification Requirements
    * Very low probability of identifying persons with info from generally accepted statistical and scientific principles
    * Removal of 18 data elements
      * Name, fax, phone, email, SSN, MRN, health plan no., acct. no., most geographic subdivisions smaller than state, all dates other than year, and biometric identifiers
      * The removal of dates is something that creates challenges for research and public health reporting

### HIPAA Enforcement

* HHS can impose monetary penalties or impose restrictions/corrective actions and monitor the entity’s adherence to them
  
* HIPAA provides for civil and criminal penalties
  * Civil Penalties
    * Range anywhere between $100 to $1.5MM per violation. Awareness, severity, and corrective measures all taken into account
      * Unknowing violations or reasonable cause ($100 - $150k)
      * Willful neglect ($10k-$50k if corrected; minimum of $50k if uncorrected)
    * HIPAA does not provide a private right of action to individuals whose information was subject to a violation
      * HHS must bring the enforcement
      * Individuals may file a complaint with HHS about a violation of HIPAA
  * Criminal
    * A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of the Privacy Rule may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment
    * Penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses
    * Increase to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm
  
* Corrective Action Plans
  * Involve creation and implementation policies to require reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
  * Back and forth to gain approval by HHS
  * Produce a final report
  
* Other enforcement measures that can be taken by HHS
  * Investigating complaints filed with it
  * Conducting compliance reviews to determine if covered entities are in compliance, and
  * Performing education and outreach to foster compliance with the Rules' requirements (e.g. letters of technical assistance)

### *Acara v. Banks* (2006 5th Cir.)

* Facts: P sues physician for disclosing medical information during a deposition without her consent. Filed complaint in federal court with violation of HIPAA as the sole basis of federal SMJ. Federal court determined that HIPAA does not provide private right of action and dismissed the case for lack of SMJ. P appealed
* Rule: **Congress must intend to provide private remedy for violations of a federal law in order for an individual to have a private right of action**
* Holding: Statutory language and purpose are strongly indicative that Congress intended to preclude private right of actions arising out of HIPAA violations (e.g. by delegating enforcement to HHS). P fails to meet burden of showing that congress intended the contrary. Thus, court affirms the dismissal

### HIPAA Privacy Rule

* PHI must be kept confidential and cannot be used or disclosed without a person’s authorization (consent) with the following **exceptions** (aka allowances):
  * Treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO)
  * Judicial and administrative proceedings
  * Reporting abuse
  * Avert serious health or safety threat
  * Health oversight activities and public health reporting
  * National Security/Intelligence and Presidential protective services
  * PHI may be disclosed for a law enforcement purpose to law enforcement officers without authorization if in compliance with a court order or warrant, or subpoena or summons issued by a judicial officer, or a grand jury subpoena, or an administrative subpoena or summons, a civil or an authorized investigative demand, or similar process authorized by law. Requirements must also be met:
    * Information sought relevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry
    * The request is specific and limited in scope and purpose to the extent reasonably practicable in light of the purpose for which the information is sought
    * De-identified information could not reasonably have been used
  
* A person’s authorization must be written and signed. The form must be in plain language and identify the information to be disclosed
  * Cannot condition treatment on authorization to disclose PHI. Exceptions:
    * Research-related disclosure can be a quid pro quo for treatment
    * Treatment may be conditioned if authorization is necessary to determine whether the individual is eligible for benefits or enrollment under a health plan, and for underwriting or risk rating determinations
    * Payment of a claim or benefits can be conditioned upon authorization if the disclosure is necessary to determine a payment and is not for the use of disclosure of psychotherapy notes
  
* For certain types of uses and disclosures, informal permission may be obtained by asking the individual outright, or by circumstances that clearly give the individual the opportunity to agree, acquiesce, or object
  * Where the individual is incapacitated, in an emergency situation, or not available, covered entities generally may make such uses and disclosures if it is in best interest of the patient based on their professional judgment
  
* **Minimum Necessary Rule**: When using or disclosing protected health information, covered entities must “make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary” to accomplish their goal
* Covered entities and business associates must have written policy and procedures to comply with HIPAA
* Authorization is required for the use and disclosure of health data for marketing of items and services
* Authorization is required for “any use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes” even if that use is for treatment, payment, and health care operations.”
  
* **Rights of Individuals**
  * Individuals have a right to access any PHI that is used in whole or in part to make decisions about the individual
  * People can request that their records be amended or request restrictions on the use or disclosure of health information by all covered entities
    * Individuals also have the right to require covered providers to accommodate their requests about how providers communicate with the individual
  * People have a right to file a complaint to the covered entity or to HHS alleging a HIPAA violation – without being retaliated against for doing so

### *Citizens for Health v. Leavitt* (2005 3rd Cir.)

* Facts: P, along with several other associations and citizens, bring suit against HHS challenging the routine use exception under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. They argue that allowing use and disclosure for purposes of treatment, payment, and operations without prior patient consent violates individual privacy rights
* Holding - Court affirms district courts decision to grant summary judgement in favor of D
  * Court addresses each of the bases that P rests its challenge on
    1. DPC of 5A - No violations can be ascribed to the government - any violations of DPC would have been occurred in hands of private entities
    1. 1A infringement of right to confidential communications - any chilling effect on communication does not derive from action of the government
    1. Exceeding statutory authority to promulgate rules - HIPAA requires HHS to balance health care efficiency and privacy protection, which is exactly what this routine use exception is doing
    1. APA violation because rule making was arbitrary and capricious - only arbitrary and capricious if completely ignoring important aspects of the problem, offering justification that contradicts evidence, or relying on inappropriate factors, none of which DHS did

### Impact of HIPAA Outside of Health Care Provision

* How Research Works under HIPAA
  * Research allowed with patient authorization
    * Authorization must be specific
    * Will delay research but still believe in consent
  * Can have research where the authorization requirement is waived by the Institutional Research Board based on a determination that:
    * Minimal risk to privacy because of an adequate plan
    * Research could not be conducted without waiver
    * Research could not be conducted without the data

* How Marketing Works under HIPAA
  * Marketing definition: to communicate about a product or service in a way that encourages purchase or use of the product or service. Exceptions:
    * Reminders to refill prescriptions
    * To recommend an alternative treatment/therapy, but only if no renumeration received
  * Authorization required if “marketing” (including any renumeration) except:
    * In face to face communications
    * With items of nominal values. E.g. pens
  
* How Law Enforcement Works under HIPAA
  * Pursuant to process (court order, grand jury subpoena, special administrative subpoena)
  * Limited information to locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person
    * Identifying info. such as name, height, weight, etc
  * Victims of a crime
  * Can get information on decedents 50 years after death
  * Can get information based on crimes on premises

### Security and Breach Notification Rules

* Security Rule
  * Protects only electronic health info; digital records, but not paper records (as of 2005)
    * > Protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security and integrity of \[e-PHI\]
  * Requires covered entities and BAs employment certain safeguards
    * Administrative – Risk analysis and management, access auth, security training, and security incident plans
    * Physical – Facility security plan, access limits to records, safe disposal and data backup processes
    * Technical – Login authentication, encryption, and audit controls
  * Link: [Mapping HIPAA Security Rule to NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/nist-csf-to-hipaa-security-rule-crosswalk-02-22-2016-final.pdf)

* Breach Notification Rule
  * Requires individual to be notified if their PHI is involved in a data security breach
    * Breach means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted… which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI
  * Individuals must be notified without reasonable delay
  * Presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity can show a low probability that the protected health information has been compromised based on risk assessment. Four non-exclusive factors:
    * The nature and extent of the protected health information involved, including the types of identifies and the likelihood of re-identification
    * The unauthorized person who used the protected health information or to whom the disclosure was made
    * Whether the protected health information was actually acquired or viewed
    * The extent to which the risk to the protected health information has been mitigated

## Genetic Information Privacy

* Genetic information is a subclass of medical information which can be retrieved from DNA to reveal following classes of sensitive information:
  * Personal information about the individual such as genes, traits, predispositions, etc
  * Medical information about kinship that can be attributed to one's genes
  * Information about the heritage of the individual (i.e. genetic ancestry)
* Development in technology and science related to genetic information has lead to numerous tangible benefits in the health care space. Care is more effective and targeted, costs will be lowered, profitable research uses, and increased market efficiency. However, increased proliferation of genetic information has enlarged existing privacy concerns and raised new ones

* Why we care about genetic information
  * Can reveal medical history, future health via gene linkage, and info about whole family
  * Many want to keep themselves from seeing this information in addition to others (e.g. adopted individuals)
  * Discrimination may result based on genetic information (e.g. denial of insurance because of high predisposition to costly disease)
    * Note: Basing employment decisions on genetic testing for future disabilities is a violation of the ADA
  * Free market may fail to adequately protect it because it fails to account for social externalities in the form of genetic determinism and attached stigma
  
* Conceptions of and legal/philosophical bases for genetic privacy
  * Personal property argument - Advanced in *Moore v. UCLA*, which asserted that if courts have held individuals have property interest in their own persona, then surely this would translate to similar right over over genetic information. Court ultimately rejected this
  * Future diary metaphor - may be predictive of future diseases and even lifespan, offering a probabilistic peek into future health. The value and effectiveness of genetic information as a predictor of future health has been widely disputed

* Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act
  * Prevents insurance companies and employers from using genetic tests to deny individuals health coverage or employment
    * Built on the existing protections of HIPAA which had partial protection from discrimination on the basis of genetic information
  * Prohibits genetic information in health insurance by forbidding insurers from adjusting “premium or contribution amounts” on the basis of genetic information
    * Effectively makes genetic information "health information" and thus subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure in HIPAA
  * Also prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of genetic information
    * It is an unfair employment practice for an employer “to fail, or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any employee, or otherwise to discriminate against any employee” because of genetic information
    * Further prohibits an employer from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information about any employee, subject to a few exceptions

* Issues related to usage in research and consent
  * Ability to replicate DNA gives rise to possibility that it be used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. Additionally, extraction of genetic information derived from genetic material/DNA into a large centralized database creates even greater privacy risks
  * Genuine informed consent can only be given if the research subjects understand and agree to the general nature of the research, are asked for additional consent for each different future usage, and the ability withdraw from research or object to specific uses
  * Private sector is more problematic because of profit motive. Argument that industry should adopt and abide by FIPs as a result
  * Presidential commission report makes recommendations regarding genetic privacy and consent that approximate something like the FIPs

## FERPA and Education Privacy

* Privacy concerns in the context of education
  * Protecting performance or disciplinary information - this information is commonly used as the basis of many inferences about a person and evaluating their intellectual capabilities. Disclosure without additional context can lead to false perceptions about that person
  * Fostering free exchange of ideas / learning process - may have chilling effect on what goes on in the classroom

* Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
  * Gives parents certain rights with respect to children's education records, which transfers to student once they reach adulthood
    * Parents/students have right to inspect and review education records **maintained by school**
    * Parents/students have right to request correction of records they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If declined, they have right to formal hearing and to place statement with the record
    * Schools must have written permission from parent/student in order to release any information from a student's education records. Exceptions: School officials with legitimate educational interests, other schools to which student is transferring, financial aid related parties, research or accreditation organizations, or subpoena

### *Owasso v. Falvo* (2002)

* Facts: Several teachers in the district use peer grading to grade student assignments. D had multiple children enrolled in district, including in classes utilizing such grading methods. D requests method be banned because it embarrassed her children, but district declined. D sues district, claiming it violate FERPA
* Rule: **Under the FERPA, student-graded assignments are not educational records**
* Holding:
  * FERPA requires that schools receiving federal funds comply with certain privacy requirements
    * Educational records cannot be disclosed without the written consent of the student’s parents. Educational records are defined as records, files, and documents related to a student that are maintained by a school or a person acting on behalf of a school
    * FERPA also requires the school to maintain a record of access for each student’s educational records
  * Student-graded assignments are not "maintained" by the school based on the terms ordinary understanding. This is also consistent with the statute's context, as the alternative interpretation would entitle parents to hearing to contest every graded assignment, an intrusion on traditional state function (federalism concern)

### *Gonzaga v. Doe* (2002)

* Facts: John Doe, student in teaching program Gonzaga alleged to have sexually assaulted another student. Program administrator overhead another student talking about the assault. Program director and another school official conduct ad-hoc investigation. However, John Doe was not informed of the investigation against him. Victim is interviewed in investigation, but gives equivocal testimony. After the school concluded its investigation, the Dean of the School of Education concluded John Doe was not fit to be licensed as a teacher due to problems with his moral character application from the incident. The Dean only told John of this a month later, and told him he had no right to appeal the situation. John Doe brought suit against Gonzaga for defamation, but also for the release of personal information to an unauthorized person under FERPA
* Legal Issue: Was John Doe deprived of right not to have education records disclosed to unauthorized persons, and if so, is this right enforceable in suits for damages?
* Rule: **FERPA nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enforceable rights and thus there is no private right of action**
* Holding: No individual private right of action for violation of rights conferred by FERPA. Congress established very unambiguous enforcement scheme - loss of federal funding for failures to comply, in addition to onsite inspection and complaint based investigations

### *Vernonia*, *TLO*, *Earls*, *Safford*

* All address 4A freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures in school setting
* Probable cause also replaced with reasonableness
  * Search actually conducted was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified it in the first place
    * Level of suspicion must match degree of intrusion. Reasonable expectation of privacy factors into the level of intrusion
    * Must not be excessively intrusive in light of the age/sex of the student and the nature of the infraction
  * Do not want to burden schools with full requirements of 4A (e.g. as they apply to law enforcement)
    * A requirement to obtain a warrant before searching a student suspected of a crime or an infraction of school rules would unduly interfere with the school’s need for swift and informal disciplinary procedures
* Threshold of reasonableness of policy
  * Considers degree of reasonable expectation of privacy
    * Students in extracurricular activities consensually subject themselves to greater levels of control and have reduced expectations
  * Considers level of student interest in maintaining privacy
  * Considers school's interest in maintaining order
    * Not necessary that the school use the least intrusive method to achieve its goal. The severity of the need must be viewed in balance with the expectation of privacy and obtrusiveness of the search

## Infosec and Breach Notification

* Cybersecurity
  * Consumer harm from security breaches includes identity theft, but also cybersecurity issues
  * Cybersecurity implicates stealing trade secrets, military info, and infrastructure tampering
* Information Security and Privacy are distinct, but probably compatible. Need security to make privacy viable
  * Privacy – individual’s right to know, choose, see, change
  * Security involves protecting three[3] primary aspects of data
    * Confidentiality - Limit access to authorized parties, prevent unauthorized disclosures
    * Availability – Maintain ability of authorized parties to access important information when needed
    * Integrity – Ensure no changes are made to important information
* Incidents or "breaches"
  * Not limited to large-scale compromise of systems, but small ordinary occurrences where sensitive information is exposed. Examples:
    * Mailing errors, inadvertent printing/faxing/scanning, etc
* What role should the law play?
  * Wide range of intentional and unintentional problems. Landscape is constantly and rapidly evolving
  * Possible models: Prescriptive, guided risk assessments, consequences for failures
  
* Various approaches
  * HIPAA
    * Scalability - takes into account size/complexity/likelihood/consequences of harm
    * Risk analysis - Measure impact, remediate risk, document/justify correction measures, maintain protection
  * GLBA
    * Streamlined Risk Assessments directed at specific activities required of information security program
  * Breach Notification - Incentive Based Approach
    * Allows actors to employ security measures as they see fit, bearing in mind the consequences of breach
    * Pros - Flexibility and scalability, probably more cost efficient
    * Cons - Some good organizations make mistakes, may underincentivize proper level of care
    * 50 states with 50 different notification laws - varying triggers, time frames, reporting content, etc
    * HIPAA also has breach notification rule
      * An impermissible use or disclosure of PHI is presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity demonstrates that there is a “low probability” that the PHI has been compromised
      * Following a breach of unsecured protected health information, covered entities must provide notification of the breach to affected individuals, the Secretary, and, in certain circumstances, to the media

## FTC Enforcement

### FTC Overview

* Federal Trade Commission - Administrative agency that is a subset of the executive branch; broad delegation of authority
  * Has both investigative authority and enforcement authority
  
* Investigative Authority
  * FTC may prosecute any inquiry necessary to its duties and may gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any person/partnership/corporation engaged in business affecting commerce
    * Exceptions: Banks, savings/loan institutions, Federal credit unions, and common carriers
  
* Enforcement authority
  * Following an investigation, FTC **may initiate enforcement action if it has "reason to believe" that the law is being or has been violated**
  * Primary purpose of enforcement authority is to enforce consumer protection laws. Said to possess "unfairness authority" to prohibit and prosecute unfair acts or practices harmful to consumers
    * Section 5(a) of the FTC Act - "**unfair or deceptive acts or practice in or affecting commerce are declared unlawful**"
      * Rather than enumerate individual unfair methods of competition, Congress intentionally left the development of the term unfair to the FTC through case-by-case litigation
      * However, FTC's interpreted meaning of unfair practices, based on case history, are those that:
        1. **Cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers AND**
        1. **Cannot be reasonably avoided by consumers AND**
        1. **Is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition**
      * Also a public policy component that factors into this determination, though the extent to which is not clear/consistent
        * Looks at the basis of an act's unfairness in common law, statutes, or the constitution in addition to all other evidence
  * **Administrative Enforcement**
    * FTC can challenge unfair/deceptive acts/practices through maintenance of an administrative **ajudication**
      * Where there is reason to believe there is a law violation, may issue a complaint setting forth its charges
        * Respondent can elect to settle charges, it can sigh consent agreement (no admission of liability), consent to entry of a final order, and waive all right to judicial review
      * Once FTC order becomes final, a respondent is liable for civil penalty. District court may also issue mandatory injunctions and other forms of equitable relief
        * FTC may also seek consumer redress from respondent for injury that was at issue in the proceeding
      * Can impose civil penalties on non-respondents who thereafter violate standards articulated by FTC. It must show that violator had "actual knowledge that the practice was unfair/deceptive and unlawful under §5(a). Limits wrongdoers to only a "single bite of the apple" before they are subject to monetary penalties
    * Can also use **rulemaking authority** - using trade regulation rules to remedy unfair/deceptive practices
      * §57(a) authorizes prescription of such rules. Mus provide opportunity for informal hearings and reason to believe practices targeted by rules are prevalent
  * **Judicial Enforcement**
    * FTC must still seek aid of court to obtain civil penalty or consumer redress for violations of its rules or orders to cease and desist
    * §13(b) authorizes FTC to seek preliminary and permanent injunctions to remedy "any provision of law enforced by the \[FTC\]." Whenever there is "reason to believe" that any party "is violating, or is about to violate" a provision of law enforced by the FTC, it may ask the district court to enjoin the allegedly unlawful conduct, pending completion of an FTC administrative proceeding to determine whether the conduct is unlawful. In proper cases, it may seek, and the court may grant, a permanent injunction
    * Agency adjudication offers certain advantages over direct judicial enforcement. In a adjudicatory proceeding, the FTC has the first opportunity to make factual findings and articulate the relevant legal standard. On review, the court is obliged to affirm the Commission's findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence. A reviewing court must also accord substantial deference to Commission interpretation of the FTC Act and other applicable federal laws. In a 13(b) suit, by contrast, the Commission receives no greater deference than would any government plaintiff
      * Thus, where a case involves novel legal issues or fact patterns, the Commission has tended to prefer administrative adjudication

### In the Matter of Facebook

* Facts: FTC brings enforcement action against Facebook for deceiving its customers with its privacy related promises. In the complaint, the FTC alleges that:
  * Changes were made to the website that made previously private information public without notifying users or getting approval
  * Third party apps could gain user info via “Friend” authorization or exceeding user granted permissions
  * Allowed access to photos and videos uploaded by deactivated accounts despite claiming they would be inaccessible
  * Users could not control own data privacy and disclosure as promised in the privacy policy
  * Claimed that it doesn't share personal information with advertisers or third parties even though it was doing so
* Outcome:
  * Facebook enters settlement agreement which barred them from making any further deceptive privacy claims, requires them to get approval before changing the way it shares data, and required it obtain periodic independent privacy assessments for the next 20 years
  It also require them to establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy program to address such risks in the future
* Notes:
  * Administrative complaints are issued by FTC whenever it has reason to believe has been violated or is about to be violated and that a proceeding is in the public's interest

### In the Matter of Google

* Facts: FTC settles with Google after charging that the company had been using deceptive tactics and violated own privacy promises to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. FTC alleged that Google's "Buzz" service violated its own privacy policies by using information originally provided to Gmail for another purpose without first seeking consent. Additionally, those who explicitly opted out of the program were still nonetheless enrolled in specific features of Buzz
* Outcome: Settlement barred Google from making any further deceptive claims about privacy or confidentiality of user data and from misrepresenting compliance with various privacy compliance programs. It also required it obtain periodic independent privacy assessments for the next 20 years and to establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy program to address such risks in the future
* Notes:
  * Nearly identical to the settlement reached with Facebook

### In the Matter of Snapchat, Inc

* Facts: FTC alleged the following in the claim it brought against Snapchat:
  * (1) Claimed snaps were gone forever after timer expired; false and misleading
    * Third party apps and computer downloads allowed bypass to save pics and videos
  * (2) Screenshot notifications; false because API work-around allowed bypass of notification
  * (3) No geolocation by Snapchat; false because Android transmitted location info for analytics
* Outcome: Snapchat enters same boilerplate settlement agreement as Facebook and Google did
* Notes:
  * This set of circumstances isn't as clear of a violation as the other ones, as all Snapchat did with screenshots was create a program with features that could be circumvented by individuals using 3rd party software (this isn't exactly a bug, but a design flaw)
    * Issue may be that Snapchat knew about the design flaw and did not take action to fix it
    * Big question here of how responsibility should be allocated. Strict liability?

### *FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp.* (2014 NJ)

* FactsL Property management system hacked on three separate occasions by brute force. Customer personal info stolen because no reasonable safeguards, leading to $10.6MM in losses. FTC alleges unfair practices due to inadequate data security (unnecessary and unreasonable exposure of customer information) and that the privacy policy was deceptive
* Issue: Does FTC have authority to regulate cybersecurity under the "unfair practices" prong and if so, did Wyndham have fair notice of its obligations and that its practices could fall short or FTC's standard?
* Outcome: FTC has sufficient authority over data security and Wyndham had fair notice of requirements
* Rules:
  * **To satisfy finding of unfairness, injury must: be substantial; not be outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and could not have been reasonably avoided**
  * **FTC’s unfairness authority over data security can coexist with existing data-security regulatory scheme**
  * **Public complaints and consent agreements along with published guidelines from FTC provide can provide fair notice**
* Reasoning:
  * Congress does not need to give FTC specific power like in other statutes; can coexist within current framework
    * Authorizing FTC to promulgate sectoral standards does not mean it didn't already have enforcement authority over cyber security under the FTC Act. Nor does its lack of authority to enact universal FIP requirements
  * Court holds that alleged misconduct falls within boundaries of FTC's meaning of unfair
    * Court rejects argument that injury was avoidable because consumers good book with another hotel brand. Consumers had been mislead by privacy policies giving them no reason to consider alternatives with better privacy practices
  * There were clear failures to establish password complexity requirements, to track systems connected to the network and enforce boundary protection to appropriately limit uses
    * Also rejects argument that D can't be liable because it itself was victimized by criminals responsible for the breach. D need not be the most proximate cause of injury if the harm is foreseeable
  * Fair Notice - Wyndham argues it is entitled to ascertainable certainty of FTC's interpretation of required cybersecurity practices
    * FTC has not yet declared that cybersecurity practices can be unfair, this is first time FTC is asking courts to interpret §45(a) in this way; there is no relevant FTC rule, adjudication, or document that merits deference
      * Thus, the case involves ordinary judicial interpretation of a civil statute and **the ascertainable certainty standard does not apply. Relevant question becomes whether Wyndham had fair notice that its conduct could fall within the meaning of unfair under the statute**
    * Court rejects contention that Wyndham did not have fair notice of the specific cyber requirements necessary to avoid liability. FTC had published several guidelines and checklists providing sound cyber practices. It had also filed complaints and entered consent agreements with companies with unfairness violations arising out of inadequate cybersecurity practices. All proposed agreements were published in the federal register
* Note: Result of this case may have been to strengthen FTC’s role in protecting consumer data security

### *LabMD v. FTC* (2018 11th Cir.)

* Facts: FTC had filed complaint that LabMD had committed an unfair act by engaging in a number of practices that, together, failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security for consumer data. This arose out of an incident by which a file containing a large amount of sensitive consumer data was inadvertently published on the p2p file sharing service LimeWire. LabMD moved for summary judgement and ALJ dismissed the complaint, concluding it failed to prove LabMD's alleged failure to employ reasonable security controls lead to substantial injury. FTC appealed and it was reversed after full Commission review, holding unauthorized disclosure caused privacy harm and that mere exposure was likely to cause injury as well. FTC subsequently ordered LabMD implement a security program which would comport with its standard of reasonableness. LabMD appealed, arguing the order does not direct it to cease committing an unfair act within the meaning of 5(a), thus the cease and desist order is unenforceable
* Holding: CoA holds that the the cease and desist order is unenforceable
* Reasoning
  * Court, for the sake of argument, assumes conduct was indeed unfair
    * In theory, failure to provide adequate security measures is grounded in tort law of negligence, so it has basis in public policy
  * Court concludes then considers whether cease and desist order is enforceable - failure to comply with this would make LabMD liable for a civil penalty
    * **Cease and desist order prohibitions must be stated with clarity and precision, else it risks due process violations that would make the order unenforceable**
    * **Order in this case does not contain any prohibitions or does not instruct LabMD to stop committing specific acts**. Instead, it commands them to overhaul security program. This command is unenforceable
      * Devoid of any meaningful standard informing the court which constitutes a reasonably designed security program (i.e. lacks specificity)
      * Narrower order, such as commanding LabMD to eliminate the possibility of employees installing unauthorized software (e.g. LimeWire), would hae been easily enforceable
      * However, complaint uses LimeWire incident as entry point to allege broad deficiencies in security practices as a whole. Used this as the basis of order which would broadly regulate all aspects of LabMDs data-security program

## Financial Privacy

* What is at stake with financial privacy?
  * Being able to ascertain one's wealth shapes perception of that individual
  * What you spend money on:
    * Useful commercial profile
    * Reveals possible illegal, immoral, embarrassing, or misleading activities
  * Concern about theft of identity of funds
  * Finances are your livelihood

* Two major statutes that govern the use of personal information by financial institutions - FCRA and GLB

### *United States v. Miller* (1976)

* Facts: D convicted of operating unregistered whiskey distillery without giving bond (as required by statute) and with intent to defraud Government of whiskey tax and tax revenues. Prior to trial, D moved to suppress copies of checks and bank records that he alleges were obtained from banks via defective subpoenas. Originally denied by trial court, but reversed by CoA who ruled that it violated Fourth Amendment rights
* Rule: **4A does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and that confidence in third party will not be betrayed**
* Outcome: Supreme Court reverses CoA and holds there was no 4A violation
* Reasoning:
  * Court finds no intrusion into any area in which D had protected 4A interest. There was no intrusion into a zone of privacy - the security a man relies upon when he places himself or his property within a constitutionally protected zone
  * Documents subpoenaed were not D's "private papers" as it relates to 4A. D had neither ownership nor possession of these records
  * D invokes *Katz* as a defense (expectation of privacy), but court points out that *Katz* made it clear that what individual knowingly exposes to the public is not subject to 4A protections (this is later the basis of 3rd party doctrine in *Smith*)
    * Considering nature of documents, Court says there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in their contents. They were not confidential communications and exposed to many different employees in ordinary course of business

### Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA)

* Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) was enacted in 1978 to "protect customers of financial institutions from unwarranted intrusion into their records while at the same time permitting legitimate law enforcement activity
  * Enacted in response to *Miller* in which SCOTUS held there was no constitutional right to privacy of financial records
* The RFPA provides that, unless a statutory exception applies: No Government authority may have access to or obtain copies of, or the information contained in the financial records of any customer from a financial institution unless:
  * The financial records are reasonably described
  * AND such financial records are disclosed in response to an administrative subpoena or summons which meets the statutory requirements
* Definitions
  * Customer - any person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution, or for whom a financial institution is acting or has acted as a fiduciary, in relation to an account maintained in the person's name
  * Person - an individual or a partnership of five or fewer individuals

### Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

* Background:
  * Passed in 1970 to regulate consumer reporting agencies. Inspired by allegations of abuse and lack of responsiveness of credit agencies to consumer complaints
  * The FCRA requires credit reporting companies to provide an individual access to her records, establishes procedures for correcting information, and sets limitations on disclosure
* Scope: Applies to any consumer agency furnishing a consumer report
  * Law shaped by the few entities that had large amounts of data at the time - federal government and credit bureaus. It now extends to a much broader set of institutions

* Definitions:
  * **Consumer report** – any type of communication by a CRA bearing on consumer’s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living…used or expected to be used to establish a consumer’s eligibility for credit, insurance, employment or other permissible purposes
  * **Consumer reporting agency** – any person, which for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis regularly engages in assembling or evaluating consumer credit info or other info on consumers for purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties with expectation that it would be for a consumer purpose
  
* **Permissible Uses of Consumer Reports**
  * Consumer reporting agencies **(CRAs) can furnish consumer reports only under certain circumstances for certain uses**:
    * In response to a court order or grand jury subpoena
    * To the person to whom the report pertains
    * To a person which the agency has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with:
      * The extension of credit to the consumer
      * Employment purposes
      * Insurance underwriting
      * Licensing or the conferral of government benefits
      * The assessment of credit risks associate with an existing credit obligation
      * Legitimate business need when engaging in a business transaction involving the consumer
    * To establish a person’s capacity to pay child support
  
* Liability for individual persons and non-CRAs
  * The FCRA does not only place restrictions on consumer reporting agencies. It **also creates a private right of action for any consumer regarding any person who under false pretenses gains a consumer report, or who willfully or knowingly fails to comply with certain of its requirements (e.g. using for impermissible purpose)**

* Requires maximum possible accuracy, adverse actions notices, and deletion over time (seven years)
  * Must employ reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy concerning individual to whom report relates
  * Deletion not applicable for credit transaction > $150k, life insurance > $150k, salary > $75k / yr
  * Accuracy requires nearly perfect record; leads to duties to investigate
  * Bankruptcies are subject to 10 years before deletion rather than 7 years
  * Imposes duty on creditors to reasonably investigate the validity of disputed charges after being notified by CRAs
* CRA must notify the entity to whom it is furnishing a consumer report of their obligations/responsibility under the FCRA
* CRA cannot furnish consumer reports to entities for which it has reason to believe has no permissible purpose for the information under the FCRA

* Rights of individuals under the FCRA:
  * Must be notified if information in report is basis for adverse action. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment – or to take another adverse action against you – must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information
  * Right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (free in many cases, but requires you verify your identity). This also includes the right to know your credit score, a numerical summary of the information contained in the files
  * Right to dispute or request correction to inaccurate/incomplete information. CRAs must correct, remove, or verify within 30 days of the request
  * When an employer or potential employer seeks a consumer report for employment purposes, they must first disclose to you in writing that a consumer report may be obtained, and you must authorize in writing that the report can be obtained (exception in the trucking industry, for whatever reason)
  * Right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a nationwide consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization (can create complications if frequently engaged in transactions involving credit checks  )
  * The entity seeking the report from a consumer agency must certify that they obtained the consent of the individual and that they will not use the information in violation of any equal employment opportunity law or regulation
    * However,  consumer reporting agency can furnish a consumer report, without the consumer’s authorization, if:
      * The transaction consists of a firm offer of credit or insurance
      * The consumer reporting agency has the opt-out provisions in subsection (e) and consumer has elected not to have their name or address excluded from lists of names provided by the agency pursuant to this paragraph (Consumers may opt out of unauthorized disclosures. May opt out for two years by phone or may sign an opt-out form, which lasts till the consumer says otherwise)

* Government agencies under the FCRA - Consumer reporting agency may furnish identifying information respecting any customer, limited to his name, addresses, places of employment, or former places of employment to a governmental agency
  * The FBI can obtain the names and addresses of all financial institutions at which a consumer maintains or has maintained an account by presenting a written request to the consumer reporting agency
    * Also, pursuant to a written request by the FBI, a consumer reporting agency must disclose identifying information respecting a consumer, limited to name, address, former addresses, places of employment, or former places of employment
    * The FBI, however, must certify that the information is sought in an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities and that the investigation is no conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by 1A

### *United States v. Spokeo* (2012)

* Facts: FTC filed complaint against Spokeo for sale of information to companies for background checks. Spokeo is an entity that assembles consumer info from online and offline sources to create comprehensive profiles on users. It promoted its product/services to HR, background check and recruiting companies. The basis for the complaint filed by the FTC were:
  * After it modified T.o.S. to state that it wasn't a CRA, there was a failure to revoke access or otherwise ensure that existing users did not use the company's website or information for FCRA covered purposes. Spokeo was thus furnishing consumer reports and functioning as a CRA despite making explicit representations to consumers that it wasn't a CRA
  * It failed to maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the permissible purposes specified in the FCRA
  * It failed to employ reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in reports that it prepared
  * It failed to provide notice to users of consumer reports as to their obligations for using the information under the FCRA (e.g. duty to notify subject of adverse action based on information contained in report)
  * It furnished consumer reports to entities that it had reason to believe had no permissible purpose for the report under the FCRA
  * It displayed comments on public profiles that were represented as reflecting the views of ordinary, independent users when they were in fact created by Spokeo
* Outcome: $800,000 civil penalty for violations of FCRA in settlement agreement
* Takeaways:
  * Measures taken by Spokeo to avoid coverage of FCRA were not enough. If you don't intend to be a CRA, you need to completely stop engaging in practices for any FCRA related purposes
  * Once an entities conduct renders them a CRA under the statute, they become responsible for the full suite of compliance obligations and are liable for any failures to do so

### *Hansen v. Morgan* (1978 9th Cir.)

* Facts: P defeats incumbent in congressional race. During lame duck session, House Admin Committee, of which incumbent was a member, launched investigation into alleged campaign finance violations by P. D, jewelry store owner, gets request to relay credit report on P. Under impression that this was for the purpose of assisting with the investigation, D gets credit report from bureau and delivers it to incumbents office. Upon learning, P files suit for violating FCRA and his right to privacy
* Rule: **Obtaining consumer report in violation of the FCRA without disclosing the impermissible purpose for which the report is desired constitutions as obtaining consumer information under false pretenses**
* Holding: The credit report was obtained in a way that violated FCRA and P has valid cause of action against D
  * Court determines the document falls under FCRA definition of "consumer report": it was written form of communication by a consumer reporting agency bearing on P's credit worthiness/standing and expected to be used for purpose of determining P's eligibility for credit transactions
  * Court says standard for determining whether report was obtained under false pretenses is whether the desired purpose for obtaining the report is permissible under the FCRA
    * CRAs can only legally issue reports for permissible purposes enumerated in the statute. Thus, since D's purpose for obtaining the report was impermissible, he only could have obtained it under false pretenses
    * Facts demonstrate that the report in this case was obtained under false pretenses and thereby forms basis of civil liability

### *Yohay v. City of Alexandria Employees Credit Union* (1987 4th Cir.)

* Facts: Ex-spouse wants access to credit reports on P to ensure he was no longer using joint credit cards. Credit union, which had contract with credit bureau, had no rules that governed obtaining reports or restricting access. P became aware when he saw credit union that he had no affiliation with had performed credit check on him. Files suit against credit union for violating FCRA
* Holding - Credit union is liable to P for willful failure to comply with FCRA
  * If willfully failed to comply with FCRA, D is liable to P for both actual and punitive (as court may allow) damages as well as attorney's fees
  * Record shows sufficient evidence to support conclusion that credit union acted wilfully. Friendly relationship between credit union manager and ex-spouse suggests he was cognizant of the impermissible purpose
  * Failing to employ any safeguards and effectively allowing anyone to request/access files furnished by credit bureau factored into courts awarding of punitive damages - this is meant to deter

### *Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Asso.* (1982 5th Cir.)

* Facts: Similarly named individuals had files mixed up in credit reporting system. Impossible to determine which information was attributable to each of the two different persons. As a result of the mixup, adverse information from one individual caused another to get denied credit over course of several months. Even after it was discovered, it took several months and pending lawsuit to get corrected
* Holding: D is liable for non-economic harm caused by its violation of the FCRA
  * Clearly violated compliance requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy in neglecting to employ procedures to discover or promptly correct egregious errors
  * **Actual damages awarded by lower court based on humiliation and mental distress do constitute as recoverable elements of damage under the FCRA**
    * Record shows that trial judge was entitled to conclude should damages were substantial

### *Johnson v.MBNA* (2004 4th Cir.)

* Facts: P's ex-spouse had account for which he owed several thousand dollars on but was removed from the account after filing for bankruptcy. Dispute as to whether P was co-obligor on account, making her legally obligated to pay off balance, or merely an authorized user. D, credit card company, concluded she was obligated and affirmed dispute verification after P contested the debt with big 3 agencies. P brought suit for failing to conduct proper investigation in violation of FCRA
* Rule: **FCRA requires creditors, after receiving notice of consumer dispute from rating agency, to conduct reasonable investigation into their records to determine if disputed information can be verified**
* Holding - Court affirms trial court finding that D violated FCRA in failing in its duty to conduct reasonable investigation
  * Plain meaning and legislative history supports interpretation that investigation must be more than superficial/perfunctory
  * Jury could reasonably conclude that D failed to act reasonably in its attempt to verify the information - nothing beyond the contents of the original records were consulted during the pseudo-investigation

### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB)

* Legislation passed in 1999 authorizing widespread sharing of consumer personal info by financial institutions
  * Financial institutions - companies that offer financial products or services to individuals such as loans, financial/investment advice, or insurance

  * Only protects financial information that is **not public**
* 3 principal parts to the privacy requirements: financial privacy rule, safeguards rule, and pretexting provisions
  * **Financial privacy** governs collection and disclosure of customer personal financial information by financial institutions and companies who receive such information
  * **Safeguards** – financial institutions must develop, implement, and maintain comprehensive info security programs to protect data. Also applies to institutions such as CRAs that receive customer financial information
  * **Pretexting** - prohibits use of false pretenses, including fraud and impersonation, to obtain personal financial information such as bank balances. Also prohibits the knowing solicitation of pretexting
  
* Privacy protecting financial info that is not public; institutions may share nonpublic personal info w/ affiliates
  * (1) Must provide notice to customer through reasonable means such as direct mail (long, expensive, and complicated)
    * Consumer v. Customer - important distinction because only customer is entitled to automatic privacy notice
      * Consumer is an individual who obtains or has obtained product or service from financial institution - only entitled when financial institution shares info with non-exempt 3rd parties
      * Customer has continuing relationship with institution
    * Notice must be clear and accurate statement of company privacy practices including what it collects and whom it shares it with
  * (2) Opt-Out Rights - right to opt out of having information shared with *certain* 3rd parties and duty for institution to provide reasonable way of doing so
    * Does not apply to disclosures to credit reporting agencies, affiliates, outside companies that provide essential services (e.g. data processing), or marketers of the financial institutions products/services
    * Share financial info w/ non-affiliates [very small category] w/ opt-out notice unless joint marketing deal
  * Cannot disclose account numbers of credit card numbers for use in direct marketing
  
* Requires the FTC and other agencies to establish security standards for nonpublic personal information. Financial institutions shall develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program that is appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution, the nature and scope of the institution’s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue
  * An information security program is defined as the administrative, technical, or physical safeguards an institution sues to access, collect, distribute, process, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle customer information

* Criticisms
  * Critics argue that the privacy notices under GLBA are difficult to understand and make it hard for consumers to opt out. This means that a lot of information can be shared.
  * Weak law in terms of consumer choice and poor notice; corporate influence driving info privacy policy
* Supporters argue that GLBA has required financial institutions to analyze their practices because they have to understand their own practices to provide the complex notices. This led many to change how they shared data as they didn’t like what they say.
  * Safeguards rule is also strong and it has the ability to preempt state laws to bring about uniformity

### *IRSG v. FTC* (2001 DC)

* Facts: TransUnion and industry association comprised of CRAs seek judicial review and challenge regulations promulgated by agencies to enforce GLB. They argue regulation of credit header information will be affected by the regulations and thus have standing
* Holding - new rules are lawful and constitutional
  * Personally identifiable financial information is an ambiguous term and the agency interpretation is entitled to deference. It rejects ISRG argument that definition in new regulations were too broad
  * Language and legislative history suggest reuse and re-disclosure limitations are implicit in the statute. While can disclose to CRA's without opt-out, this doesn't apply to further use or disclosure by CRA
  * 1A argument fails - this is commercial speech which is subject to lesser protections. It is not related to any matter of public concern
  * The new rules do not directly prohibit the use and disclosure of nonpublic personal information, but instead require financial institutions to provide customers with notice and the opportunity to opt out. This is **consistent with the purpose of GLA - to allow consumers to retain control over their financial information** - and thus it can't be said that the government interest here is too small to justify such broad use restrictions, even in light of the significant effects it would have on the use of credit-header products
* Key takeaway - Shows the indirect impact on databroker and marketing industry

### *Guin v. Brazos* (2006 MN)

* Facts: Telecommuter with unencrypted laptop has the device stolen from their home. Laptop hardrive contained files which included personal financial information. P brings negligence suit, arguing GLBA established duty
* Holding:
  * In order to prevail, must show existence of duty, breach, and harm
  * GLB requires comprehension information security program. Hoewver, court concludes there is insufficient evidence from which fact finder could determine D failed to  comply with GLB
    * GLB does not establish requirement to encrypt or prohibit working on sensitive data in their homes
    * Since no breach of a legal duty, no liability for negligence
  * Further, even if there were a breach, P failed to show that any harm occurred as a result. No evidence was presented that those who burlarized laptop targeted the personal data of P

### *Huggins v. Citibank* (2003 SC)

* Facts: P sued several banks, contending that they negligently issued credit cards to an unknown imposter, John Doe, who applied for the cards asserting that he was P. The cards were used to incur large amounts of debt. P contends Banks were negligent for failing to investigate or verify Doe's identity before issuing the cards and for the grief that he suffered when creditors tried to collect the debt
* Holding: Banks not liable under negligence theory
  * Tort of negligence requires P establish that there was some duty of care/harm prevention that D owed to P. Here, the relationship between the credit card issuers and P were insufficient to establish such a duty
  * While court expresses concern about identity theft and acknowledges that increased scrutiny in the credit application process would certainly reduce identity theft, the relationship is too attenuated and would thus extend tort liability beyond reasonable limits if D was held liable

### Criminal Liability for Identity Theft or Violating Financial Privacy

* GLBA's Pretexting Provisions
  * Using false statements or documents to obtain information from financial institutions or individuals
* Identity Theft Assumption and Deterrence Act
  * Knowingly using a means of identification with the intent to commit any unlawful activity or felony under state or federal law
* Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
  * Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization
  * Intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization and as a result of such conduct recklessly causes damage
  * Theft of property via computer
  * Trafficking in passwords (e.g. via phishing)

* Transparency and consumer control
  * Opportunity to exercise choices will "never be more than a few clicks away" from standardized wording and link/icon
  * Ad choices page to allow user to control/opt-out over ad preferences
* No federal statute squarely occupying space
  * GDPR has had extra-territorial impact since it took effect in 2018
* Example of self-regulation as an approach to privacy law and policy
  * Industry writes and enforces rules and guidelines

## Cloud and IoT

* IoT ("Internet of Things") refers to the ability of evereday objects to connect to the internet and to send and receive data
  * Experts estimate that there will be 50 billion such connected devices by the year 2020
  * Real time monitoring of information collected by these devices offers tremendous benefits (e.g. health care, energy use, road safety)
  * However, presents great security risks including:
    1. Enabling unauthroized access and misuse of personal information collected by these devices
    1. Facilitating attacks on other systems (e.g. botnets)
    1. Creating risks to safety by altering the physical behavior of these connected devices
  * Also unique privacy risks, including:
    1. Sensitive personal information (e.g. precise geolocation, health vitals, and financial account numbers) is being directly collected, often without consumer awareness or meaningful consent
    1. Infrences that can be made about personal habits and physical conditions (e.g. health and mental condtion, lifetyle, mood) based on the sheer volume and nature of information collected. The amount and granularity of data allows analyses to be performed that wouldn't otherwise be possible. This runs the risk of this information being used in unauthorized ways and having real-world consequences (e.g. employment, credit access, health insurace costs)
       * FCRA imposes obligations on CRAs, but excludes most "first parties" that collect consumer information and would not cover device manufacturers that perform the collection/analytics themselves. Thus, would not cover companies that collect data directly and use them to make in-house credit/insurance eligibility decisions
