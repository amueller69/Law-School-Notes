## Origins of the Right To Privacy and Privacy Torts

* Warren and Brandeis' first to call for express "Right to Privacy" tort claim
  * Argued for explicit recognition of the "right to be left alone"
    * While also referring to the "sacred precincts of domestic life" in their article, the intrusion into the home wasn't the threat to privacy they emphasized
    * Instead, they stressed the problem of unwanted publicity about private life as the basis for a privacy tort
    * This would protect the individual's interest in "inviolate personality"

* *De May v. Roberts* (Michigan – 1881)
  * Facts: A doctor and a friend travelled to assist a woman in childbirth. Woman consented to friend’s presence, but later learned he was not a healthcare professional at all , and brought suit
  * Holding: Court held that P **had a legal right to privacy of her apartment at such time** and to be free of any violation thereof. The fact that she consented to the friend's presence does not preclude her from recovering, as failure to disclose full identity/character was deceit and thus a wrong by D which lead to substantial damages from shame and mortification. Accordingly, D is entitled to relief
  * Notes:
    * Here, privacy is characterized as a intimate knowledge of one's physical body, the compromise of a woman's modesty, intrusion into private home life, and a shattering of ones expectation of privacy

### *Manola v. Stevens* (NY 1890)

* Facts: Female stage performer’s manager published a photo of her in tights, and she brought suit for violation that “offended her modesty”
* Holding: Woman entitled to relief
* This case was used by Warren and Brandeis to show that courts were already open to the idea of **protecting privacy against unwanted publicity**
  * Violation of female figure's modesty and autonomy to control use of her likeness was evidence that court has extraordinary willingness to protect individual privacy

### Edwin Godkin, “*The Rights of the Citizen to his Reputation*”

* Defense of privacy with elitist undertones
* Doubted the law could adequately incorporate a right to protecting “so ethereal a quality” as sense of privacy
* Embraced both privacy of the apartment and of unwanted publicity (combines *Roberts* and Warren/Brandeis conceptions of privacy)
* Views privacy as a “luxury of civilization,” previously unknown in “barbarous societies”
  * Element in society **which most contributes to its moral and intellectual growth**
* Right to control information about his thoughts, feelings, and private doings is the same as natural right to decide how much to eat, what to wear, etc.
* Privacy valued more by some individuals than others (e.g., women more than men)

### Warren and Brandeis, “*The Right to Privacy*”

* “That the individual shall have full protection in person and in property is a principle as old as common law, but it has been found necessary from time to time to define anew the exact nature and extent of such protection”
* There is no doubt in the need to protect privacy
  * The intensity and complexity of life have rendered it necessary some retreat from the world and individuals, under the refining influence of culture, have become more sensitive to publicity, making this all the more important
  * Gossip perverts belittles by inverting the relative importance of things, thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of people
  * Gossip is fed by supply/demand – so protections are needed to curb
* “It is our purpose to consider whether existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of an individual, and if so, to what extent and nature”
  * **Common law indicates a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions and sensations, especially in the form of intellectual or artistic property** (property as basis for privacy)
    * It secures the right of determining the extent to which thoughts, sentiments, and emotions shall be communicated to others
    * This should not be dependent on the method or medium of expression adopted (i.e. limited to art, music, etc.)
    * These protections are merely an instance of the more general right to be left alone
    * Since common law indicates such a general right to privacy for thoughts, emotions, etc., then **they should receive the same protections**
  * Conclude that privacy rights are not arising from contracts or special trusts, nor the general principle of private property,” but “**rights against the world”**
* Limitations to the right of privacy
  1. Does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest - only those that are unwarranted
      * “Protect those persons with whose affairs the community has no legitimate concern, from being dragged into an undesirable and undesired publicity, and to protect all persons, whatsoever their position or station, from having matters which they may properly prefer to keep private, made public against their will”
  1. Does not prohibit communication of matter when the publication is made under circumstances that render it a “privileged communication according to laws of slander and libel”
  1. Should not grant redress for invasion of privacy by oral publication in absence of special damage
  1. Right to privacy ceases upon publication by the individual or with his consent
  1. Truth of the matter does not afford a defense
      * “It is not for injury to the individual’s character that redress or prevention is sought, but for injury to the right of privacy”
  1. Absence of malice is not a defense
      * Suggested remedies for violation of privacy include: compensation, injunction

### *Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance* (Georgia – 1905)

* Facts: Photo of man used in ad implying that he had purchased that company’s insurance, which he had not
* Holding: The fact that the man is an artist does not establish a waiver of the man’s right to privacy, and using a man’s image without his permission is a serious invasion of one’s right to privacy
  * Court cites numerous bases for right to privacy
    * Natural law - right to live as one will, provided no interference with others
    * Even Romans recognized the importance of providing protection against physical intrusion on privacy
    * Constitutional - e.g. 4th Amendment
    * Precedent - *Manola*
* Other considerations:
  * Right to live a life of seclusion without interference, if one so choses
  * Realization that one's image is being used is to recognize his liberty has been taken away from and he is now under the control of another
    * Difficult question of where this liberty ends of others and the public begins
  * Nothing from which to infer that D waived rights. Mere fact that he is an artist doesn't do this
  * No semblance of an expression that warrants 1A protection

### William Prosser, *Privacy* (California Law Review, 1960)

* Previously, most privacy cases dealt with where there existed a right to privacy – however now able to form some definite conclusions on the topic
* Law of privacy comprises 4 kinds of invasion of 4 different interests of the plaintiff:
  1. invasion on P’s seclusion or into his private affairs
  1. public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about P
  1. Publicity that places P in a false light in the public eye
  1. Appropriation for the D’s advantage of the P’s name or likeness

### Restatement (Second) of Torts – Invasion of Privacy, General Principle (§652A)

1. One who invades the right of privacy of another is subject to liability for the resulting harm to the interests of another
1. The right of privacy is invaded by:
    1. Unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another, as stated in 652B
    1. Appropriation of another’s name or likeness, as stated in 652C
    1. Unreasonable publicity given to the other’s private life, as stated in 652 D, or
    1. Publicity that unreasonable places the other in a false light before the public as stated in 652E
