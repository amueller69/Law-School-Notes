# Government Surveillance

## Constitutionality of Government Surveillance Methods

* Two steps to the legal analysis
  1. Compliance with constitutional restrictions
  1. Congressional authorization under constitutional authority
* This section is concerned with the former, specifically 4th Amendment constitutionality

* **4th Amendment**
  * > The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized
  * Does it give basis for searching private property?
    * It is prohibitive in nature, so does not do so affirmatively. The word privacy never appears in the Constitution! – so the right to privacy is a bit constructed
    * Almost no authorizations of constitution are self-enforcing, instead they merely provide boundaries and invitations for congress to act
      * Constitutionality then becomes a matter of statutory analysis
  * Why is 4th Amendment relevant here?
    * Privacy is implicated in unreasonable searches and seizures
    * 4th Amendment violations remedied through the exclusionary rule
      * Effective at creating incentives to comply with 4A
      * Comes at price of absolving parties that are clearly guilty of an offense
  * Why are there more restrictions on government intrusions than on private entities?
    * Government is unique insofar as it has a monopoly over the exercise of power

* **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Test:**
  * > A "search" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the Government violates a person's "reasonable expectation of privacy." - Harlan in *Katz*
  * Later becomes two-prong test:
    * Governmental action must contravene an individual's actual, subjective expectation of privacy
    * Expectation of privacy must be reasonable, in the sense that society in general would recognize it as such
  * Considerations:
    * To what extent is "reasonable expectation" question a normative one rather than a positive one?
    * Alito in *Jones*: Functional analysis examining qualitative factors (e.g. duration, nature of information, etc)
  * Problems
    * Susceptible to societal change
    * Standard rather than a rule – easier to apply, harder for individuals to know when their privacy is protected
    * Conditioned expectations – all the government has to do is announce that it's going to start recording all phone calls and then the reasonable expectation of privacy is gone. Government can move needle
    * Polls indicate that things SCOTUS has ruled don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy are in fact viewed as highly intrusive by Americans (drug dogs, bank records)
* **Plain view doctrine**
  * If something is in the plain view of a police officer, then he doesn't need a warrant to seize it → if something can be seen/heard from a public vantage point, then it doesn't get 4th Amendment protection. (how far does this go? Are telescopes/super-powerful microphones allowed?)
* **Third-party doctrine**:
  * You have no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to any information you share with a third party
  * Critiques
    * Sharing info with a specific person or class of persons is not broadcasting it for the world to see
    * Content/non-content distinction is often hazy
    * Often lack of meaningful alternatives to activities involving disclosure to 3rd parties
    * Disconnect between application and people's beliefs
* **Open fields doctrine**
  * Established in *Oliver v. US* - No reasonable expectation of privacy in your private fields (despite no trespassing signs)
  * Curtilage – Parts of one's property immediately outside one's home don't fall under this rule and are subject to the usual reasonable expectation of privacy test
* Other Considerations
  * Who Should protect privacy?
    * Congress: can act ex ante and control own agenda; democratically elected
    * Courts: ex post; people can't dance around the law

## 4th Amendment Cases

### *Olmstead v. United States* (1928)

* Communications intercepted by tapping into telephone lines
* Majority holds this did not violate 4th Amendment protection of information obtained by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area
  * Based on historical purpose of 4th Amendment, which was to prevent exercise of government force to search person, their house, or their effects against their will
  * Since there was no physical entry into the home or offices of the suspect, there was no unlawful search under 4A
  * Recites "trespass doctrine", which was exclusive controlling standard until *Katz*
* Brandeis Dissent
  * As technology advances, court must adapt in order to protect privacy interest. This surveillance method is not qualitatively different that intercepting mail, which court has held violates 4A
* *Notes cases:
  * *Lewis v. US/Hoffa v. US* – Undercover agents who talked with defendants are constitutionally allowed to offer evidence against the defendant.
    * If the home were such a sacred area, then defendant's consent wouldn't be able to waive his privacy interest there
  * *On Lee v. US* – using a hidden microphone (strapped to an undercover officer) to gather evidence against the defendant is constitutional
  * *Silverman v. US* – police use spike mic to spy on the defendant, ruled unconstitutional because the spike mic trespassed on the defendant's private property

### *Katz v. United States* (1967)

* Facts: Wiretap placed on exterior of public phone booth without a warrant
* Holding:
  * Court rules that *Katz* was justified in expecting the contents of his call to be private, thus protected under 4th Amendment" when entering the booth and shutting the door
  * Introduces the "**reasonable expectation of privacy**" standard
    * Departure from the "trespass doctrine" which prohibited methods whereby government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area. Appears to displace this doctrine?
    * "**Fourth Amendment protects people, rather than places**"
    * Governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements

### *United States v. White* (1971)

* Background: "Misplaced trust" case where police obtained oral evidence by attaching wire to cooperating confidante of suspect. The government agents overheard these conversations through a wire-tap the informant was wearing
* Holding:
  * Court holds that there is no interest in case protected by 4th amendment, as it offers no protection to mistaken belief that a person who one voluntarily confides in won't reveal information
  * "However strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations...are not protected by the Fourth Amendment"
  * Pointing to case involving disclosure to undercover police agent, court similarly holds that recording by person acting on behalf of police does not constitute a search
* Dissent (Douglas, J.): Electronic surveillance is the modern means of eavesdropping; it is an assault on privacy and therefore should be regulated by 4th Amendment protections
* Dissent (Harlan, J.): The immediate relaying of info to government agents via electronic surveillance should be protected under 4th Amendment and a warrant should be required

### *Smith v. Maryland* (1979)

* Facts: Pen register case challenged on 4th Amendment grounds. Police arrest D based on information obtained via pen register installed on his phone without a warrant
* Holding:
  * Rules that **a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information that the person voluntarily turns over to third parties**
    * Applies to phone numbers, which are voluntarily conveyed to cell-carriers a means of establishing communication
    * Pen register did no constitute a search - privacy of what is said on the call is not infringed by this technique
      * **Content/non-content distinction**
    * Defendant “assumed the risk” that the company’s records “would be divulged to police.”
* Marshall Dissent - Privacy is not a discrete commodity. Such voluntary disclosures to a third party does not mean people have assumed the risk that the information will be passed on to the police. People have no practical alternative to using a telephone, so it's absurd to tell people they need to assume the risk of disclosure. Also, pen registers could be used by the government to halt political dissent, so their use should be regulated by warrants
* Stewart Dissent - Revealing who a person speaks with on the phone actually reveals intimate details about his or her life.There was a reasonable expectation of privacy here

### *Kyllo v. United States* (2001)

* Facts: Federal agents used thermal imaging device aimed at home to detect illegal activity occurring on the inside. Challenged on 4th Amendment grounds
* Holding:
  * Court holds that **where government uses advanced technology to explore details inside the home that would have previously been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a search and a warrant must be obtained**
    * Permitting this method would put homeowners at the mercy of advancing technology
    * Court has held for nearly a century that 4th Amendment draws firm line at entrance to house, thus to draw another arbitrary line for details that are not "intimate" would be both unpractical and a violation of that principle. Protections shouldn't be tied to the degree of intrusions into the home
* Dissent (Stevens): Heat from the home had entered the public domain and the police's observation of it was not a search. Plain view doctrine should apply here
* *CA v. Ciraolo* (Notes) – Police don't have to shield their eyes when driving past homes
  * Scalia thinks Katz imposed a requirement on top of that imposed in Olmstead rather than overruling it

### *United States v. Forrester* (2008)

* Background: Challenges to validity of surveillance mechanism, by which government monitored volume/destination of emails and web traffic, under the 4th amendment
* Holding:
  * Court cites both *Katz* (that expectation of privacy extends to the contents of a phone call) and *Smith* (that phone call metadata, rather than the contents, are captured using pen register and thus there is no violation)
  * Court finds this case analogous to *Smith* in that **there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for destination IP addresses when relying on 3rd party equipment to communicate** (i.e. route the traffic)
    * Like in *Smith*, the **contents of the communication are not revealed. Thus, court ruled method did not constitute a 4th amendment search**

### *United States v. Warshak* (2010)

* Facts: Government suspects Warshak of defrauding customers, so requests ISP preserve contents of emails and provide them without warrant
* Holding:
  * Court holds that **reasonable expectation of privacy extends to content of emails  stored with or sent/received through a commercial ISP, as it does to contents of communication over other mediums**
    * **Government may not compel an ISP to turn over the contents of a subscriber’s emails without a warrant**
    * ISP is the functional equivalent of post office or phone company, neither of which can be compelled to reveal contents of customer communications without a warrant
  
### *United States v. Jones* (2012)

* Facts: FBI attaches GPS on suspects truck to track movements after warrant had expired
* Holding: Plurality finds that this violated 4th Amendment protections against unlawful searches
* Scalia Opinion - A vehicle is an “effect” for Fourth Amendment purposes. Thus, the government’s installation of a GPS device on Jones’s vehicle constitutes a “search.” While acknowledging *Katz* still applies in cases involving communication signals where there is no trespass, the trespass here was clear and thus is the basis for the search's unlawfulness
  * Returns to formalistic property based standard, while acknowledging *Katz* still exists
* Concurrence (Sotomayor): Physical intrusion isn't the only way that the government can violate your privacy. Search is defined by the type of information take. Writes that *Smith* decision should be reconsidered to better suit digital age, however, Physical intrusion provides narrower basis for decision
* Alito Concurring in Judgement - Argues against application of trespass doctrine post-*Katz*. Invites legislative action to regulate these methods, but until then, the reasonable expectation test in *Katz* should apply. Majority fails to address the possibility that the government could violate your privacy without physical intrusion. The length/invasiveness of the tracking is the crucial factor
* Shadow Majority - Sotomayor joins Scalia majority despite appearing to adopt reasoning of Alito. This underscores need for additional clarity

### *Riley v. California* (2014)

* Facts: Police searched D incident to an arrest and seized his smartphone. The police searched the smartphone and used items found as evidence at D's trial on shooting charges brought by CA. D was convicted. On appeal, the court determined the warrantless search was a valid search incident to arrest
* Holding: Under 4th Amendment, the **government may not conduct a warrantless search of the contents of a cell phone seized incident to an arrest absent exigent circumstances**
  * Absent more precise guidelines, court generally determines whether to exempt search from warrant requirement by **assessing degree to which it intrudes privacy against the degree to which it is needed to protect government interests**
  * Searches incident to arrest are allowed only to ensure officer safety or to prevent the destruction of evidence. The interest in preserving evidence can be served by confiscating the phone and then waiting for a warrant to search it (you can put it in a black box if you really have to). Police can get more info from searching the phone than from searching an entire house.
    * Mosaic Theory – Allowing police to view which apps you use through the third party doctrine would allow them to make a complete picture of you
  * Concurrence (Alito): State legislatures are better suited to address this issue through new laws than federal courts are through 4th Amendment decisions

### *Carpenter v. United States* (2018)

* Background: Case where cell-site location information, which reveals location of phone based on nearest cell-tower, was obtained from carrier and used to convict suspect for involvement in robbery
* Holdings:
  * Court declines to extend "third party" principle articulated in *Smith*, in which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when information is voluntarily divulged with 3rd party, to the present circumstances
    * As technology advances, court acknowledges need to preserve degree of privacy 4th amendment intended to protect at time of adoption. It could not be foreseen, at time of *Smith*, a world in which phones are capable of tracking owners movements
  * Thus, **using CSLI to record an individual's movements over period of time constituted a search**. Individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy
* Majority Reasoning
  * CSLI does not “fit neatly under existing precedents,” and that it instead lies at the “intersection of two lines of cases” the first line addressing geolocation, and the second addressing the third-party doctrine
    * Geolocation
      * Roberts quotes Justice Alito’s *Jones* concurrence, noting that "longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy"
      * "Even greater privacy concerns than the GPS monitoring of a vehicle we considered in Jones," because a cell phone is almost a "feature of human anatomy" (quoting Riley) and "tracks nearly exactly the movements of its owner"
    * Third Party Doctrine
      * The services carriers provide are "such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life" that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society, thus cell phone location information is not truly ‘shared’ as one normally understands the term,
      * Apart from disconnecting the phone from the network, there is no way to avoid leaving behind a trail of location data. As a result, in no meaningful sense does the user voluntarily “assume[] the risk” of turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical movements
    * There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today
  * Conclusion: "the deeply revealing nature of CSLI, its depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach, and the inescapable and automatic nature of its collection," writing that "the fact that such information is gathered by a third party does not make it any less deserving of Fourth Amendment protection."
* Dissent
  * Court has twice held that individuals have no Fourth Amendment interests in business records which are possessed, owned, and controlled by a third party. Cell-site records are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process
    * This principle established in Miller and Smith should control
    * The defendants in those cases could expect that the third-party businesses could use the records the companies collected, stored, and classified as their own for any number of business and commercial purposes. The businesses were not bailee's or custodians of the records, with a duty to hold the records for the defendants’ use. The defendants could make no argument that the records were their own papers or effects
  * That line that the majority draws illogical and will frustrate principled application of the Fourth Amendment in many routine yet vital law enforcement operations
* Problems with Carpenter:
  * Creates even more uncertainty. Suggestions of a narrow ruling, meaning *Smith* 3rd party doctrine is still good law. Essentially a balancing act between privacy interests and disclosure
  * Balancing test might compromise away rights due to the immediacy of concerns which compel disclosure

### Workplace and Hotel Searches

* Work Issued Pagers (Notes)
  * Facts: Ontario, CA issued pagers to its police officers. Employees went over the word limit, sending personal messages and causing the city fees. The city obtained transcripts of the texts, which the officers argued was a violation of their 4th Amendment Rights
  * Holding: Regardless of whether officers had a right to privacy on the pagers, the **search was constitutional because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and not excessive in scope** (consistent with the court’s prior ruling in *O’Conor v. Ortega*)
    * Emphasized past decisions holding “operation realities” can reduce an employee’s privacy expectations and that these can be taken into account when considering if a workplace search is constitutional

## Overview of Surveillance-limiting Statutes

* Historic Statutes
  * Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 – nation’s first major anti-wiretapping statute
    * Provided that “No Person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance… of such intercepted communication to any person”
    * Did not prevent use of wiretaps – just restricted admissibility of evidence gained via wiretap into court
  * Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 – Nation’s second major statute limiting surveillance goes much further
    * Enacted same year as *Katz* (which recognized right to privacy in telephone communications) and *Berger v. New York* (found a state statute that regulated scope of electronic surveillance didn’t adequately protect 4th Amendment rights)
    * Attempted to establish strong privacy safeguards, recognizing also legitimate circumstances that may require use of surveillance
    * Regulated both face-to-face communications and telephone calls
    * Supplanted by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
  
* **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978** – passed to address special demands of national security and foreign espionage left open by *Katz*
  * Established a procedure through which government agencies could obtain expedited, top-secret approval for national security-related surveillance
  
* **Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986**
  * Addressed major developments in technology, such as the growth of email
  * Sought to overturn decision in *Smith v. Maryland* (third-party doctrine)
  * ECPA has been amended many times
  * Often referred to as Title III as it was technically an amendment to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act (Wiretap Statutes)
  * **Title I of ECPA – (Wireless and Electronic Communication Interception Act (“Wiretap Act”)**
    * Prohibits intercepting oral, wire, or electronic communications during their transmission
    * Covers landlines, cell phones, satellite communications, and emails in flight and in "transient storage" during transmission
  * **Title II of ECPA – Stored Wire and Electronic Communications Act (“Stored Communications Act”)**
    * Makes it a crime to obtain, alter, or block access to a wire or electronic communication in electronic storage
    * Governs access to stored email and voice mail
    * Also governs ISP’s ability to provide 3rd party access to user and subscriber data
  * **Title III of ECPA – Pen Register Act**
    * Regulates use of pen registers and capture of non-content portions of wire and electronic communications
    * Regulates called ID equipment and other “trap and trace” devices that capture outgoing/incoming phone numbers
  
* Digital Telephony Act of 1994 (“Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act,” “CALEA”)
  * Amended ECPA - Reflected concerns that emerging technologies would frustrate law enforcement surveillance
  * Requires telecommunication providers to modify their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure they have the necessary surveillance capabilities
  * Extended ECPA Title I to cordless phones (which were previously excluded based on their radio technology)
  
* **USA PATRIOT Act** - a.k.a Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
  * Aimed at facilitating the global war on terrorism, including domestic terrorism
  * Temporarily shifted stored wired communications from Wiretap Act to SCA, which has lower standard of approval and no exclusionary rule
  * Authorizes SCA warrants to be nationwide. Court can delay notice of search warrants if it concludes that there is reasonable cause that immediate notice will create an adverse result
  
* Cyber Security Enhancement Act of Homeland Security Act of 2002
  * Amended ECPA Title II to battle computer crimes and release ISP from liability for good faith disclosures to government of customer info in electronic storage
  * ECPA does not regulate video-only surveillance nor provide clear guidance on GPS or cell phone tower-based positioning data gathering
  
* USA Freedom Act
  * Ended bulk collection of telephone toll records

## ECPA Title I (Wiretap Act) and its Predecessor (Omnibus Crime Control - Title III)

* With Title III, Congress sought to regulate use of electronic surveillance as an investigative tool and disclosure of materials obtained through surveillance
* Purpose is to control conditions under which interception will be permitted to safeguard privacy of wire and oral communications
  * “Animating Title III is an overriding congressional concern with the protection of individual privacy”
  * Surveillance techniques are authorized only in investigations of serious offenses, is all subject to prior judicial approval which is issued in accordance to detailed application procedures and finding of probable cause
* Most clearly reflected in Title III’s strictly limited disclosure provisions, permitting disclosure of intercepted communications in 3 circumstances only:
  1. Law enforcement may disclose to another law enforcement officer to the extent required to perform duties
  1. Law enforcement can use the contents to extent appropriate to perform their duties
  1. While giving testimony under oath
* Explicitly authorizes recovery of civil damages by persons whose communications are disclosed in violation of the statute
* Richard Turkington: analysis of ECPA Title I (“Title III”) cases
  * 4 steps analysis should be utilized in evaluating Title I cases:
    1. Determine if there was an interception of a communication
    1. Determine whether there is a section 2517 exception
    1. Determine if interception satisfies section 2518 (which establishes the necessary procedure for obtaining court ordered electronic surveillance
    1. Consider applicability of a criminal sanction, civil remedy, or right to exclude

### Wiretap Act

* Only when normal methods of investigation are infeasible
* Three types of communications:
  1. Wire communication – aural transfer made by wire
  1. Oral communication – utterance by a person
  1. Electronic communication – transfer of signals by wire or spectrum that is not wire or oral communications
  
* **18 U.S. Code § 2510 - Definitions**
  * **Electronic communication** - any transfer of signs, signals…of any nature by a wire, radio, electromagnetic…system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include:
    * Any wire/oral communication
    * Tone-only paging devices
    * Tracking devices
    * Electronic funds transfer information
  * **Wire communication** - any aural transfer made…by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection…furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing…such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications…and such term includes any electronic storage of such communication
  * Other definitions:
    * “**Aural transfer**” means a transfer containing the human voice at any point between and including the point of origin and the point of reception
    * “**Intercept**” means the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device
    * “**Electronic, mechanical, or other device**” means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than—(a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business
    * "**Readily Accessible to the General Public**” - means, with respect to a radio communication, that such communication is not—(A) scrambled or encrypted; (B) transmitted using modulation techniques that preserve the privacy of such communication;(C) carried on a subcarrier or other signal subsidiary to a radio transmission; (D) transmitted over a communication system provided by a common carrier, unless a tone only paging system
  
* **18 U.S.C §2511 - Interception and disclosure of wire, oral, or electronic communications prohibited**
  * §2511(1)
    * Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who
      * (a) intentionally intercepts…any wire, oral, or electronic communication;
      * (b) intentionally uses…any electronic, mechanical, or other device to intercept any oral communication…
  * Shall be punished as provided in subsection (4) or shall be subject to suit as provided in subsection (5)
  * §2511(2)
    * (g) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter or chapter 121 of this title for any person-
      * (i) to intercept or access an electronic communication made through an electronic communication system that is configured so that such electronic communication is readily accessible to the general public
    * (ii) to intercept any radio communication transmitted: (I) for the use of the general public or relates to ships, aircraft, vehicles, or persons in distress, (II) governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile, or public safety readily accessible to the public, (III) ham or CB, (IV) marine or aeronautical
  
* Wiretap Act has highest standard and strongest privacy protection of the 3 main ECPA provisions
  * Not only requires law enforcement **have probable cause to believe intercepting phone calls will lead to evidence of specific, enumerated crimes** (i.e. those listed in §2516), but also requires law enforcement to demonstrate:
    * **(1)** Probable cause that communications regarding the crime will be obtained by the wiretap (§2518(3)(b))
    * **(2)** Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous (§2518(3)(c))
    * **(3)** Probable cause to believe the phone number or other electronic “facility” where the communication to be intercepted occurs has a connection to the crime or person to be wiretapped
  * Also imposes requirements to ensure surveillance does not exceed that which is reasonably necessary (§2518(5)):
    * > No order entered under this section may authorize or approve the interception...for any period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, nor in any event longer than thirty days
    * > Every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in thirty days
  
* Application of Wiretap Act to Email
  * Electronic communications includes communications in transient storage intrinsic to communications process
  * Email not yet read is subject to the Wiretap Act
  * Email in pre- and post-transmission storage is governed by the SCA
  
* Application of Wiretap Act to Wi-Fi
  * Capturing payload data violates Wiretap Act
  * “Readily accessible the general public” applies only to “radio communication” like traditional radio (i.e. auditory broadcasted communications)

### Minimization Requirement - *Scott v. United States* (US Supreme Court – 1978)

* Facts: Title III requires wiretapping or electronic surveillance "be conducted in a way as to minimize" interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under Title 18 § 2518(5). Government got wiretap approval and agents intercepted for one month virtually all conversations of suspects. 40% of the calls were clearly narcotics related, and the remaining calls were for the most part short. D argues there was no good-faith effort to comply with minimization requirement, in violation of statute.
* Holding (Rehnquist):
  * Proper approach for evaluating compliance with the minimization requirement, like evaluation of all alleged violations of 4th Amendment, is **objectively to assess the agent's or officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time, without regard to his underlying intent or motive**
  * Even if agents fail to make good faith efforts at minimization, that is not itself a violation of the statute requiring suppression, since use of the word "conducted" in §2518(5) makes clear the focus was to be on the agents' actions, not motives
  * Whether the way in which a wiretap was conducted is reasonable will depend on facts and circumstances of each case
    * % of non-pertinent calls intercepted not a sure guide to correct answer; also important to consider the circumstances of the wiretap (could be ambiguous or used coded/guarded language)
    * **Short and ambiguous nature of non-pertinent phone calls did not give the agents an opportunity to develop a category that should not have been intercepted, and hence their interception cannot be viewed as a violation of the minimization requirement**
* Dissent (Brennan): The minimization requirement was central to passage of Title III and the court is disregarding this in their majority decisions, as the minimization requirement was clearly violated by the agents

### Intercepting Emails In-Flight/Transient Storage: *United States v. Councilman* (1st Circuit – 2005)

* Facts: Interloc gave book dealer customers an e-mail address at the domain "interloc.com" and acted as the e-mail provider. CEO ordered employees to configure mail server to copy all incoming communications to subscriber dealers from Amazon.com (competitor). D contends the email messages were not “electronic communications” and the method they were copied was not “interception” under the Wiretap Act
* Issue - one of statutory construction
* Holding: 1st Circuit reviewed and holds that D's interpretations ere inconsistent with congresses intent
  * D infers that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of "electronic communication" regardless if still in the process of reaching end destination, simply because it was not specifically enumerated in the statute
  * ECPA text does not suggest whether or not electronic storage while in transmission falls under Wiretap Act. Court thus turns to legislative history, which it determines establishes that **electronic communication includes transient storage intrinsic to the communications process. Thus, the conduct in this case violated the Wiretap Act as copying this communication constitutes and "interception"**
* EPIC Amicus Brief
  * Internet-based mail services clearly distinguish between the routine storage that occurs when a message reaches its destination and is available to its intended recipient and the temporary “storage” that occurs as electronic mail moves in many discrete steps from sender to recipient
  * "Storage” occurs only at the endpoint when a message is accessible to the intended recipient
  * Access to an Internet communication before it was accessible to the intended recipient would be considered an “interception

### Intercepting Wifi Communications - Joffe v. Google Inc. (9th Circuit Court of Appeals – 2013)

* Facts: While capturing Street View photos, Google collected data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks (“payload data”). Google was sued under Wiretap Act
* Holding:
  * Wiretap Act exempts intercepting “electronic communications made through an electronic communication system” if the system is configured so that it is readily accessible to the general public (radio communication also exempted) – so Google argued its collections were exempted
  * Court agrees with Google that the definition of “readily accessible to the general public” apples to the §2511 exemption, when the communication in question is a radio communication
  * However the **“radio communication” in § 2510 excludes payload data and the court chooses to adopt the “common meaning” of the phrase “radio communication” (which is commonly understood to be “1) predominantly auditory and 2) broadcast”).** Therefore the data collected by Google is a violation of the Wiretap Act
  * If Congress has intended satellite to be encompassed in a “radio communication,” they wouldn’t have called it out separately. Thus, can't assume radio communications extends to things like satellite television

## ECPA Title II - Stored Communications Act

* **§2701 – Unlawful access to stored communications**
  * **§2701(a) - Offense**
    * Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section whoever—
      * (1) intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided; or
      * (2) intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility;
    * and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication **while it is in electronic storage** in such system shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section
  * **§2701(c) - Exceptions**
    * Subsection (a) of this section does not apply with respect to conduct authorized:
      * (1) by the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communications service;
      * (2) by a user of that service with respect to a communication of or intended for that user; or
      * (3) in section 2703, 2704 or 2518 of this title
  
* **§2702 - Voluntary Disclosure of Customer Communications or Records**
  * **§2702(a) - Prohibitions**
    * Except as provided in (b) or (c)—
      * (1) a person providing an electronic communication service shall not knowingly divulge the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service; and
      * (2) a person providing remote computing service (storage or computer processing) shall not knowingly divulge the contents of any communication which is carried on that service from and for those subscribe for the sole purpose of storage and processing services

* **§2703 - Required Disclosure of Customer Communications or Records**
  * **§2703(a) - Contents of Wire or Electronic Communications in Electronic Storage**
    * A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication, that is in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for one hundred and eighty days or less, only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described. A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communications services of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that has been in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for more than one hundred and eighty days by the means available under subsection (b) of this section

### Access to Stored Email - *Jennings v. Jennings* (Court of Appeals of South Carolina – 2012)

* Facts: Woman discovered card in husbands car for flowers and confronted him. Husband was having an affair with a woman he corresponded with at work. Woman’s daughter-in-law, "hacked" (really just guessed password) husband’s web based email account to find out who the other woman was. Husband sues under the SCA
* Rules:
  * Under §2701, a violation of the SCA occurs by anyone who:
    1. Intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which electronic communication is provided, or
    1. Intentionally exceeds authorization to access that facility
  * SCA defines electronic storage as:
    * A) Temporary, intermediate storage of a ware or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission and
    * B) Any storage of which such communication by an electronic communication services for the purpose of backup protection
  * **Thus, SCA only pertains to communications intercepted or accessed prior to delivery to the intended recipient or in backup storage**
* Holding:
  * D not liable under the SCA, as the emails were not in “electronic storage” (as they were on the Yahoo! Server and apparently were not retained in such as way as to qualify as “backup protection” as required by the statute)
    * Court declines to extend backup protection under statute to the act of simply retaining opened emails on the server, which is what happens by default in the absence of any additional actions (e.g. deleting from server)
      * Backup necessarily presupposes the existence of another copy to serve as a substitute. No reason to deviate from this meaning
* Concurrence : Traditional interpretation of the SCA (e.g., the DOJ’s interpretation is the correct version); the majority relies on Weaver; advocates that “electronic storage refers only to 1) temporary storage made in the course of transmission and to 2) backups of such intermediate communications. This rejects the local/cloud distinction from *Theofel*, meaning final destination is reached upon being opened
* Notes:
  * SCA creates criminal liability and expressly provides for private right of action against violators
  * It was the express intent of Congress in enacting the SCA to bar anyone from accessing communications without permission and to bar providers of electronic communication services from knowingly diverging
  * The *Jennings* decision was met with sharp criticism
  * **The most followed interpretation of what it means to be in “electronic storage” is from the 9th circuit in, holding “prior access is irrelevant to whether an email is in electronic storage”**

### ISP Liability for Police Disclosures - *Freedman v. America Online Inc.* (D. Conn – 2004)

* Facts - D1, police officers, sent an improper search warrant (no judge signature) to AOL (D2) who sent back P's information. P sued under the Electronic Communication Privacy Act, arguing that soliciting information disclosure by AOL with invalid search warrant violated ECPA as did AOL's compliance with the request
* Holding: Movement for partial summary judgement was granted to extent that finds D1 in violation of the ECPA
  * ECPA distinguishes between rights of government entities and rights of private entities regarding discloser of subscriber info by an ISP. Governmental entity must comply with specific legal process (e.g., a search warrant, subscriber consent, etc.)
    * Holding here relies on McVeigh v. Cohen, holding government is liable for soliciting subscriber info without complying with ECPA’s legal process requirements
  * Defendants argue they didn’t require AOL to disclose – court finds this argument “disingenuous” and doesn’t absolve them from liability. It also contradicts Congress' intent to protect personal privacy. ECPA imposes obligation for ISP to comply and the request resembled compulsory court order, thus reasonably likely that AOL simply thought they were complying. AOL was clearly expected to respond here, and this erodes congressional intent
  * Defendants also contend there is genuine dispute of material fact on whether the emergency exception applies – Court rejects this, as no “immediate danger” and no evidence about what AOL may have actually believed was provided

### Email Acquisition via Overbroad Subpoena - *Theofel v. Farey-Jones* (9th Circuit – 2004)

* Facts: Civil matter in which an ISP handed over hundreds of private emails during course of discovery in response to a request for all emails (rather than a limited scope of emails)
* Holding: **Emails delivered, read, and on an ISP server are still electronic storage for purposes of the SCA**
  * Court reject D's first argument that access was authorized because ISP turned over emails in response to subpoena
    * SCA reflects Congress' judgement that users have a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of communications in electronic storage, similar to common law trespass protections
    * Federal statutes are interpreted in light of common law – which court finds implies “**no refuge for a defendant who procures consent by exploiting a known mistake that relates to the essential nature of his access**”
    * Defendants clearly knew the subpoena was invalid, as it was so outrageous, and its immaterial that NetGate could have objected as the subpoena was deceptive and that is an independent ground for violating consent
  * Court also rejects defense that messages were not in stored communication thus there is no violation of the SCA
    * Since read/delivered emails are no longer in transmission, primary issue becomes whether their storage is for the purpose of "backup
    * > An obvious purpose for storing a message on an ISP's server after delivery is to provide a second copy of the message in the event that the user needs to download it again — if, for example, the message is accidentally erased from the user's own computer. The ISP copy of the message functions as a "backup" for the user. Notably, nothing in the Act requires that the backup protection be for the benefit of the ISP rather than the user. Storage under these circumstances thus literally falls within the statutory definition
    * **SCA Subsection B “by its plain terms, applies to backup storage regardless of whether it is immediate or post-transmission”**
    * The US Government, as amicus curiae, disputed the court’s interpretation, stating subsection (b) refers only to backup copies of messages that are in of themselves temporary (as this would make accessing emails such as these more difficult). Court rejects this interpretation, saying their is no reference to subsection (a), thus no reason to infer that "temporary" storage language should factor into subsection (b)
    * Court also rejects argument that its interpretation renders meaningless the separate (and more liberal) standard for remote computing services. Message stored by RCS (cloud) would not necessarily be stored for purposes of backup protection and thus subject to more stringent standards set forth in §2703(a). This is significant because **an RCS (cloud) might be the only place a user stores his messages, thus the messages are not stored for backup purposes in these cases**
* Outcome: Reverse dismissal of the Stored Communications Act claim, affirm dismissal of the Wiretap claim (holding this act only applies to interception contemporaneous with transmission, not while in electronic storage), and reverse dismissal of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act claim
* Notes:
  * In re National Security Agency Telecommunications: neither FISA, ECPA Title II, nor federal common law completely preempts state law for greater privacy protection
  * In this case, petition to remand to state court was still denied because US government intervened as plaintiffs, making the case removable on other grounds

### Who is an “Electronic Communication Service” under Title II? – The Airline Passenger Data System Exclusion

* *Dyer v. Northwest Airlines Corp.* (D.N.D. – 2004)
  * Facts: Post-9/11, NASA requested system-wide passenger data from Northwest airlines for a 3-month period, and Northwest complied. This triggered a wave of litigation
  * Holding: “Electronic communication service” encompasses ISPs and telecommunication companies – but does not encompass businesses selling products online – so, Northwest is not an ISP and outside the scope of §2702 and the ECPA as a matter of law
  
* *In re JetBlue Airways Corp. Privacy Litigation* (E.D.N.Y. – 2005)
  * Facts: JetBlue maintains “Passenger Name Records” on each of its passengers, In creating the PNRs, JetBlue’s privacy policy said it would not share customer financial data with 3rd parties. Post-9/11, TSA got involved and requested the data from JetBlue, who agreed to cooperate. In 2003, JetBlue CEO disclosed this, leading to a series of suits under ECPA, among other statutes. JetBlue filed Rule 12(b)(6) motion
  * Holding: JetBlue is **not an electronic communication service provider as a matter of law within the meaning of ECPA nor a remote computing service, thus it is not liable under §2702 of ECPA**

### National Security Letters (NSLs) and the "Gag" Requirement - *Doe v. Gonzales* (2d Cir. 2006)

* Background:
  * National Security Letters (NSLs) - Administrative subpoenas use to gain access to subscriber info and billing record from providers of a wire or electronic communication service (e.g. an ISP) when this information is relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. It was originally enforced along with a strict gag order that prohibited the recipient from disclosing the letter from **anyone**
    * Later amendments to §2709(c) permit exceptions to gag order, allowing disclosure to legal counsel, those necessary to comply with request, and other approved parties
    * Amendments also provided availability of prompt judicial review
    * Restrictions on disclosure (1A implications) and relaxed standards of approval have made these subject to much controversy
* Facts:
  * §2709 imposed a gag order on the recipients so they could neither inform anyone of receiving an NSL, nor act as witnesses
  * In 2005, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization, which dramatically altered §2709
    * E.g., Revised §2709 allows an NSL recipient to talk with an attorney
  * John Doe (P) was the recipient of an NSL that requested all information associated with one of his Connecticut library’s computers
    * P argues that despite revisions to §2709, gag order is still unconstitutional and violates 1A rights
* Holding:
  * Court found non-disclosure (“gag”) rules of §2709 which prevented P from revealing identity as an NSL recipient to be unconstitutional, based on the First Amendment. It thus granted preliminary injunction because of “irreparable harm" from suppression of its speech
* Concurrence:
  * Agrees with majority, but writes separately to emphasize the need to “resolve tension between government’s interest in maintaining the integrity of its investigative process and the First Amendment” (asserts government is going beyond democratic principles)
  * Permanent ban on disclosure seems so extreme that it is highly unlikely to be justified by a compelling government interest
* Note: National Security Letter Library Exception
  * Librarians objected to the “loss of confidentiality” imposed as result of section 2709, resulting in the “Privacy Protection for Library Patrons” exclusion
  * This exclusion states that libraries will NOT be considered a “wire or electronic communication service provider” as the library’s ISP is the actual “provider” of wire service

## USA PATRIOT Act

### Susan N. Herman - Discussion of the most controversial surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act

* Section 215: Librarians and Beyond
  * Authorizes the government to acquire records and tangible things from custodians – including educational or financial institutions
  * Eliminated the requirement that government demonstrate any form of individualized suspicion
    * Merely requires FBI director or designee to certify that they believe information relevant to national security investigation
  * Contains a broad gag order that prohibits any person from disclosure to anyone “other than those persons necessary to produce those tangible items
    * Criticisms of gag order include:
      * Violates Fourth Amendment by not requiring a couple to find individualized suspicion before issuing the order and by not providing for notice to the target, even after the fact
      * Violates First Amendment, as allows gathering info about individual’s reading habits, internet activities, religious practices, etc.
    * Government responds by arguing section 215 provides more process than constitutionally required (e.g., targets have no Fourth Amendment rights)
  
  * *Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor v. Ashcroft*
    * Ps believed they had been targeted under a 215 search. This potential misuse affected the behavior of community members, who became afraid to practice religion or make political expressions. However, because of the secrecy surrounding implementation of Section 215, the government has a considerable advantage in the litigation (as the Attorney General could control when and what info was divulged). Lead to difficulty establishing standing and ripeness. Proceedings took place ex parte without equal access to the facts
  
* Section 505: National Security Letters
  * Goes even further than 215 in circumventing judicial oversight of government collection of info from 3rd party custodians by allowing the government to obtain records from a communications provider by issuing its own administrative subpoena, called a “National Security Letter”
  * Similar to 215, no requirement for individualized suspicion and includes a broad gag rule – but criticism is even more fervent as no judicial role is contemplated at all
  * Attempt to litigate constitutionality of Section 505 - same distortions of litigation process as above
    * One brought by ISP who was served with an NSL and claimed 505 violated 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments
    * Government argued 505 constitutional by construing it to allow the NSL to consult with counsel and bring judicial proceeding contesting constitutionality – court rejected this argument
    * Holding: did not address whether violated 4th Amendment; held 505 could be used in a manner that infringed on 1st Amendment
  
* Section 218: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA)
  * Expands government’s power to use Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to conduct electronic surveillance by only requiring FISA court approval (rather than “normal” court) (so lower standard than “probable cause”)
    * Advocates argue FISA has many safeguards similar to those required for when electronic surveillance is used in a criminal investigation  (e.g., some element of a minimization requirement)
  * SCOTUS has never ruled on constitutionality of FISA, however constitutionality of 218 has been the subject of a judicial opinion (handed down in a “highly unusual ex parte proceeding”)
  * Because of the statutory scheme and constitutional law involved with 218 are so complex, its unrealistic to expect meaningful public assessment of the changes effected by 218
  
* Section 213: Sneak and Peek
  * Applies in cases where the government has honored the 4th Amendment norm by obtaining a search warrant based on probable cause (allows the government to ask a court for permission to defer notifying the target that a search or a seizure has taken place)
    * Critics say 4th Amendment requires notice prior to search and that failure to notify is a denial of due process
  * There appears to have been no litigation over constitutionality of 213
  * A Gallup poll indicated strong disapproval for 213 – which led Congress during the “sunset debates” (e.g., renewal period) to add in some time limits (although these also were quite elastic)

## ECPA Title III - Pen Register Act

### Pen Register Act

* **§3121(a) - In General**
  * Except as provided in this section, no person may install or use a pen register or a trap and trace device without first obtaining a court order under §3123 of this title or under FISA or an order from a foreign government that is subject to an executive agreement that the Attorney General has determined and certified to Congress satisfies §2523
* **§3121(a) - Exception**
  * Does not apply to use of pen register or trap device by provider of service:
    * Relating to operation/maintenance/testing of service
    * Relating to protecting subscribers from abusive or fraudulent use
* **§3121(c) - Limitation**
  * A government agency authorized to install and use a pen register shall use technology reasonably available to it that restricts the recording of electronic impulses so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic communications
* **§1327 - Definitions**
  * The term “pen register” means a device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication, but such term does not include any device or process used by a provider or customer of a wire or electronic communication service for billing, or recording as an incident to billing, for communications services provided by such provider or any device or process used by a provider or customer of a wire communication service for cost accounting or other like purposes in the ordinary course of its business
  * The term “trap and trace device” means a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication;

### In the Matter of the Application of the USA (Southern District of Texas – 2006)

* Issue - This opinion addresses whether the government may obtain “post-cut-through dials digits” containing communication contents under the authority of the Pen/Trap Statute
* Background
  * “Post-cut-through dials digits” = any numbers dialed from a telephone after the call is initially setup or “cut-through” (sometimes telephone numbers, or sometime real info, e.g., bank account numbers)
    * As result of this dual capacity, post-cut-through dialed digits occupy doubtful place in federal electronic surveillance law
  * During debates of CALEA, discussed the capacity of pen registers to capture content information in the form of post-cut-through dialed digits  so CALEA amended to limit use of pen registered to use them “reasonably”
  * 1999: FCC passed the “J-standard,” creating standard technical standards including capability for “post-cut-through dialed digit extraction” (means it must generate a list of all digits entered after a call has been connected)
  * 2001: During PATRIOT Act debates, expanded Pen/Trap statute to include “all dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information” (so extended coverage to Internet communications)
  * Opponents worried this would allow government to obtain contents of communications w/o a warrant -> led to 3 amendments:
    * (1) added phrase “shall not include the contents of any comm” to the pen register definition (Section 3127)
    * (2) same phrase added to trap and trace definition (Section 3127)
    * (3) added phrase “so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic communications” was added to the reasonably available technology limitation (Section 3121) (anything past “1-800” was considered content)
  * **It’s undisputed that post-cut-through digits can include call content**
* Holding: Post-cut through dialed digit contents may be intercepted by law enforcement under the Wiretap Act, and collected from electronic storage under the SCA. **They are not available to law enforcement under the Pen/Trap statute**. Section 3121 is a limitation, not a license. Because the Pen/trap Statute triply forbids what the government requests, the application to acquire post-cut-through dialed digits must be denied
  * Government’s argument based on what “technology is reasonably available”. No such technology exists to discern content from non-content in the case post cut-through

## FISA

### Pre-FISA Terrorism Surveillance - *United States v. United States District Court* (1972)

* Facts: US charged 3 Ds with conspiracy to destroy government property. During pretrial, US government admitted it has used electronic surveillance and that the AG had approved the wiretaps, but no judicial approval. District court found that the surveillance was unlawful and appeals court affirmed
* Issue: Does President have power, acting through the AG, to authorize electronic surveillance in internal security matters without prior judicial approval?
  * Government argues search was lawful as reasonable exercise of president’s power, the special circumstances applicable to domestic security necessitates a further exception to the warrant requirement, and that disclosure to a magistrate of all or even a significant portion of info involved in domestic security would create danger
* Holding: affirms DC and appeals court that **judicial approval is needed for domestic surveillance**. Concerns not great enough to depart from customary requirement of judicial approval
  * Recognizing that 4th amendment is not absolute and thus it must weight basic values at stake in the case by weighing the duty of government to protect domestic security and individual right to security/privacy
    * This includes asking whether warrant requirement would unduly frustrate government protection efforts against domestic terrorism
  * Rejects government’s argument that internal security matters are too “subtle and complex” for judicial evaluation
  * Emphasizes that this holding is limited to domestic, not foreign surveillance (“foreign powers and their agents”) -> This opening led to creation of FISA

### Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA)

* The FISA and the FISC
  * FISA prescribes procedures for requesting judicial authorization for electronic surveillance and physical search of persons engaged in espionage or international terrorism against the US on behalf of a foreign power
  * FISA Court (FISC) incudes 7-11 judges, of whom “no fewer than 3 shall reside within 20 miles of DC”
  * FISA Court of Review created to review applications denied by FISC
  
* **§1805(a) - Necessary Findings**
  * Upon an application made pursuant to section 1804, the judge shall enter an ex parte order as requested...approving the electronic surveillance if he finds that:
    * (2) On the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to believe that:
      * (A) The target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power: Provided, That no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment
      * (B) Each of the facilities at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
  
* **§1804(a) - Approval (Significant Purpose)**
  * Each application for an order approving electronic surveillance under this subchapter…shall include:
    * (6) a certification by an executive branch official designated by the President:
      * (B) that a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information
  
* **§1801(a) - Definition of "Foreign Power"**
  * Foreign government or any component thereof, whether or not recognized by the United States;
  * A faction of a foreign nation or nations, not substantially composed of United States persons;
  * An entity that is openly acknowledged by a foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign government or governments;
  * A group engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor;
  * A foreign-based political organization, not substantially composed of United States persons;
  * An entity that is directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments; or
  * An entity not substantially composed of United States persons that is engaged in the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
  
* **§1801(b) - Definition of "Agent of a Foreign Power"**
  * Any non-US person:
    * Who acts as an officer or employee of a foreign power
    * Who acts for a foreign power which engages in clandestine intelligence activities
    * Who engages in intl. terrorism activities (or preparations)
    * Who engages in the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
  * Any person (incl. U.S. person) who:
    * Engages in clandestine intelligence gathering for a foreign power that may involve criminal violations
    * Knowingly engages in sabotage or intl. terrorism
    * Knowingly enters U.S. under a false or fraudulent identity on behalf of a foreign power
  
* **§1801(e) - Definition of "Foreign Intelligence Information"**
  * Information that relates to the ability of the United States to protect against:
    * Actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
    * Sabotage, intl. terrorism, or the intl. proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by a foreign power; or
    * Clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power
  * Information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to:
    * The national defense or the security of the U.S.; or
    * The conduct of the foreign affairs of the U.S.
  
* **Lone-wolf Amendment to FISA (2004)**:
  * Definition of “agent of a foreign power” now includes any non-U.S. person who “engages in terrorism or activities in preparation therefor.” Person doesn’t need to be tied to a foreign power
  * International terrorism involves activities that occur totally outside of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the person they appear intended to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum
* Contrasting the Wiretap Act with FISA
  * Both Title III and FISA:
    * Prescribe authorization procedures to be followed before electronic surveillance may be conducted (e.g., judicial approval, minimization, and limitations on use of intercepted info)
    * Impose civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized surveillance
    * Regulation “aural and visual electronic surveillance” but
      * FISA = foreign
      * ECPA = domestic
  * Standard of review in FISA varies greatly from Title III in regards to probable cause
    * FISA requires showing of PC that target is foreign power or agent thereof. Title III requires showing PC for belief that specific individual has committed or is about to commit a predicate crime  
    * FISA only requires an official designate the type of intel info being sought and to certify that the information being sought is indeed foreign intelligence information, where as Title III requires PC to believe that information related to crime will be obtained through the interception
    * Title III requires government showing nexus between facilities and communications regarding the criminal offense. FISA only requires PC that facilities have been or will be used by foreign power/agent
  * With respect to notice, Title III requires notice to target once surveillance order expires. FISA only requires notices to persons whose communications were intercepted and are planned to be entered as evidence in proceedings
  
* Annual FISA report from office of Attorney General
  * In 2014, government made 1,416 applications to FISA, of which 1,379 included requests for electronic surveillance; none of these were denied either in whole or part (nor did they deny any of 170 requests for business records)

### The Wall - *In re sealed case no. 02-001* (2002)

* Facts: first appeal from FISC to the FISA court of review; FISC decision related to surveillance of a known foreign target  where the FISA court restricted the type of surveillance that the government could do
* The restrictions were from an assumed barrier between intelligence officials and law enforcement in the executive branch (known as “the wall”)
  * This "wall" emerged from the FISC's implicit interpretation of FISA, most likely out of concerns that FISA may be used to circumvent high standards of domestic surveillance under ECPA
  * FISC had enacted the restrictions to (in their opinion) comply with minimization based on its authority to create procedures designed to prevent acquisition/dissemination of surveillance information unnecessary to foreign intelligence needs; however never referenced any text from FISA nor PATRIOT Act amendments. Government contends that this limitation is neither mandated nor authorized by FISA
  * 50 USC §1805(A): Tthe target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power: Provided, That no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States”
* Holding: FISA (as amended by the PATRIOT Act) support the government’s position and **the restrictions imposed by the FISA court are not required by FISA nor the Constitution** – therefore remand with instructions to grant the applications as submitted (e.g., without restriction)
  * Many courts have relied on the *Truong* court involving electronic surveillance before FISA and based on President’s executive power, and holding the Executive Branch should be excused from securing a warrant only when “object of the from search is a foreign power, its agents or collaborations and “the surveillance is conducted primarily for foreign intelligence reasons” – led to the “primary purpose test”
  * Patriot Act amendments to FISA clearly reflect Congress' intent to facilitate coordination between law enforcement and intelligence. FISA courts failure to acknowledge this or provide a constitutional basis for upholding the wall may be a violation of the constitution itself
    * Patriot Act amendments clearly disproved of primary purpose test, stating that foreign intelligence must only be a **significant purpose**
    * Court still firmly asserts that FISA process cannot be used as a device to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes, though concerns about abuse are unwarranted because even under this process, improper purpose will be clear and thus denied
  * FISA’s general programmatic purpose, to protect the nation against terrorists and espionage threats directed by foreign powers, has from onset been distinguishable from “ordinary crime control”. Notwithstanding uncertainty surround presidential authority to direct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, **the amended FISA process come close enough to meeting 4A warrant standards and is thus constitutional because the surveillance it authorizes is reasonable**

### *Clapper v. Amnesty International* (US 2013)

* Facts:
  * FISA authorized the United States government to conduct surveillance on non-U.S. citizens that were outside the U.S.
  * Amnesty International (Ps) are lawyers, journalists, and human rights researchers, among other things, who do work that often has them communicating with individuals abroad that there was an “objectively reasonable likelihood” to be subject to surveillance under FISA. Further, given the risk of surveillance, they had to spend significant funds to ensure that their communications were kept confidential The plaintiffs brought suit seeking a declaratory ruling that this portion of FISA was unconstitutional
* Holding and Reasoning (Alito, J.):
  * Threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact for purposes of Article III standing
  * To establish standing, a party must establish that its injury is “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.” More specifically, threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute actual or imminent
  * In the present case, the plaintiffs do not present any evidence that their communications have been intercepted by FISA. To the contrary, they merely claim that there is an “objectively reasonable likelihood” that their communications will be intercepted in the future. However, the plaintiffs have no knowledge of how the government uses or plans to use this portion of FISA
  * For the plaintiffs’ speculations to come true, government must plan to target P's under FISA powers, get FISC approval, and successfully intercept communications that were initiated by P
  * Thus, **Ps do no more than speculate that the surveillance may occur in the future and that is not sufficient to meet the standing standard**. The argument that they have incurred costs due to fear of future surveillance also fails; **can't “manufacture standing” by spending money in anticipation of a harm that is not certainly impending**
* Dissent (Breyer, J.):
  * The majority’s construction of the word “certainly” is too rigid; in actuality it should be construed as “reasonable probability” or “high probability.” Record shows that the possibility of interception under FISA is more than just speculative, but reasonably likely considering the nature of their communications. Thus, this standard for standing is met

### ACLU v. Clapper (2d Cir. 2015)

* Background:
  * The NSA had a program that collected domestic telephone metadata in bulk and on a daily basis, including: (1) the caller’s and recipient’s numbers; (2) the date, the time, the user or device making or receiving the call, and the duration of the call; (3) limited location information; and (4) calling-card numbers. The metadata did not include the content of the telephone call. The NSA received authority for the program from FISC pursuant to § 501 of FISA, as amended by § 215 of the PATRIOT Act
  * Plaintiffs challenge the legality of the bulk telephone metadata collection program, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the program
  * Court must decide if collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of § 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act as it was intended by Congress
  * Federal district court dismissed complaint and plaintiffs appealed
* Holding and Reasoning:
  * **The NSA’s bulk collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of § 215 of the PATRIOT Act**
  * Unlike in *Amnesty Intl*, Ps have standing here since it can be demonstrated that their call records were among those collected, thus the surveillance goes beyond impending but has already taken place. From a standing perspective, NSA's activity is most appropriately challenged as a seizure. However, there is also adequate standing to assert a 1A claim, through the direct effects and indirect "chilling effects" that this surveillance has
  * Government concedes that the data collected by the bulk-collection program is not tied to any authorized investigation and is not relevant to a broader threat to national security. Records demanded are not of suspects or those thought to be associated with suspects in an investigation. Rather, the government contends that the data may allow the NSA at some point in the future to identify information relevant to an investigation. It argues that "relevance" is a broad and generous concept under which this activity is justified
    * Court finds government's expansive concept of "relevance" to be both unprecedented and unwarranted
    * > Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans
    * This fails even the permissive "relevance" test
  * This expansive interpretation of § 215 is not what Congress intended. If it had been, it would have been expressed unambiguously in the statute after being subject substantial debate
  * The plaintiffs also argue that the bulk-collection program violates the First and Fourth Amendments. However, because the program is not authorized by § 215, there is no need to reach the constitutional issues
* Notes: Re-authorization of bulk collection
  * USA Freedom Act was signed in 2015; restrains some communications surveillance practices revealed to the media by Snowden
  * FISC later re-authorized the bulk collection program for the transition period leading up to the USA Freedom Act taking effect
  * FISC concluded that *ACLU v. Clapper* was not binding on itself and disagreed with the court's analysis. It interpreted USA Freedom act as congressional intent to permit such activity until statutory authorization was set to expire

## All Writs Act

* Provides that: “The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.”
* As of 1977 Court had repeatedly recognized the power of a federal court to issue such commands under the All Writs Act as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued
  * “This statute has served since its inclusion, in substance, in the original Judiciary Act as a ‘legislatively approved source of procedural instruments designed to achieve “the rational ends of law.”’

### United States v. New York Telephone Company (1977)

* Facts
  * Federal Court in SDNY issues order authorizing FBI to install pen register on phone lines and directing D to furnish information and technical assistance necessary to install them unobtrusively (they would be compensated by FBI in return for assistance)
  * FBI had PC that illegal gambling operation was being run out of a facility. D provided FBI information about lines necessary to install pen register, but declined to lease lines to FBI so it could install them unobtrusively. The only alternative would have alerted suspects as to the surveillance
  * D moved to vacate the order that they provide technical assistance arguing that such direction was not authorized under All Writs Act
  * D's motion was initially denied but overturned by CoA, who concluded that courts should not embark upon such a course without specific legislative authorization.
* Issue - Whether a United States District Court may properly direct a telephone company to provide federal law enforcement officials the facilities and technical assistance necessary for the implementation of its order authorizing the use of pen registers1 to investigate offenses which there was probable cause to believe were being committed by means of the telephone
* Holding and Reasoning:
  * The Court recognized **the power conferred by the All Writs Act extends, under appropriate circumstances, to persons who, though not parties to the original action or engaged in wrongdoing, are in a position to frustrate the implementation of a court order or the proper administration of justice and encompasses even those who have not taken any affirmative action to hinder justice**
    * Conforms with principles under which act had historically been applied, which provide that "a federal court may avail itself of all auxiliary writs as aids in the performance of its duties, when the use of such historic aids is calculated in its sound judgment to achieve the ends of justice entrusted to it"
  * Court found that D was a third-party that was not so far removed from the underlying controversy that it could not be compelled, especially with PC that its facilities were being used to facilitate a criminal enterprise
    * Request was not offensive to it and there is no overly-compelling interest in declining to assist
    * No other conceivable means for FBI to accomplish this task
  * Court concludes the **request was consistent with the All Writs Act** and this assistance from utilities is a necessary implication of congressional action authorizing pen registers. Prohibiting the order would unduly frustrate law enforcement and congress' intent in authorizing such surveillance measures
* Dissent
  * Even if order authorizing pen register is valid, dissent does not accept the Court’s conclusion that the District Court had the power under the All Writs Act requiring D to assist in its installation. This conclusion is unsupported by the history, the language, or previous judicial interpretations of the Act
    * It has always been acknowledged that whatever assistance is authorized must be in aid of the court's duties and jurisdiction
    * Governments interest in its investigation is entirely independent of court's interest in its jurisdiction
    * "Plainly, the District Court’s jurisdiction does not ride on the Government’s shoulders until successful completion of an electronic surveillance"
  * While the request at hand is inoffensive, the order is deeply troubling as a portent of the powers that future courts may find lurking in the arcane language of the All Writs Act.
