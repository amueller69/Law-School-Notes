# Government Surveillance

## Constitutionality of Government Surveillance Methods

* Two steps to the legal analysis
  1. Compliance with constitutional restrictions
  1. Congressional authorization under constitutional authority
* This section is concerned with the former, specifically 4th Amendment constitutionality

* **4th Amendment**
  * > The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized
  * Does it give basis for searching private property?
    * It is prohibitive in nature, so does not do so affirmatively. The word privacy never appears in the Constitution! – so the right to privacy is a bit constructed
    * Almost no authorizations of constitution are self-enforcing, instead they merely provide boundaries and invitations for congress to act
      * Constitutionality then becomes a matter of statutory analysis
  * Why is 4th Amendment relevant here?
    * Privacy is implicated in unreasonable searches and seizures
    * 4th Amendment violations remedied through the exclusionary rule
      * Effective at creating incentives to comply with 4A
      * Comes at price of absolving parties that are clearly guilty of an offense
  * Why are there more restrictions on government intrusions than on private entities?
    * Government is unique insofar as it has a monopoly over the exercise of power

* **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Test:**
  * > A "search" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the Government violates a person's "reasonable expectation of privacy." - Harlan in *Katz*
  * Later becomes two-prong test:
    * Governmental action must contravene an individual's actual, subjective expectation of privacy
    * Expectation of privacy must be reasonable, in the sense that society in general would recognize it as such
  * Considerations:
    * To what extent is "reasonable expectation" question a normative one rather than a positive one?
    * Alito in *Jones*: Functional analysis examining qualitative factors (e.g. duration, nature of information, etc)
  * Problems
    * Susceptible to societal change
    * Standard rather than a rule – easier to apply, harder for individuals to know when their privacy is protected
    * Conditioned expectations – all the government has to do is announce that it's going to start recording all phone calls and then the reasonable expectation of privacy is gone. Government can move needle
    * Polls indicate that things SCOTUS has ruled don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy are in fact viewed as highly intrusive by Americans (drug dogs, bank records)
* **Plain view doctrine**
  * If something is in the plain view of a police officer, then he doesn't need a warrant to seize it → if something can be seen/heard from a public vantage point, then it doesn't get 4th Amendment protection. (how far does this go? Are telescopes/super-powerful microphones allowed?)
* **Third-party doctrine**:
  * You have no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to any information you share with a third party
  * Critiques
    * Sharing info with a specific person or class of persons is not broadcasting it for the world to see
    * Content/non-content distinction is often hazy
    * Often lack of meaningful alternatives to activities involving disclosure to 3rd parties
    * Disconnect between application and people's beliefs
* **Open fields doctrine**
  * Established in *Oliver v. US* - No reasonable expectation of privacy in your private fields (despite no trespassing signs)
  * Curtilage – Parts of one's property immediately outside one's home don't fall under this rule and are subject to the usual reasonable expectation of privacy test
* Other Considerations
  * Who Should protect privacy?
    * Congress: can act ex ante and control own agenda; democratically elected
    * Courts: ex post; people can't dance around the law

## 4th Amendment Cases

### *Olmstead v. United States* (1928)

* Communications intercepted by tapping into telephone lines
* Majority holds this did not violate 4th Amendment protection of information obtained by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area
  * Based on historical purpose of 4th Amendment, which was to prevent exercise of government force to search person, their house, or their effects against their will
  * Since there was no physical entry into the home or offices of the suspect, there was no unlawful search under 4A
  * Recites "trespass doctrine", which was exclusive controlling standard until *Katz*
* Brandeis Dissent
  * As technology advances, court must adapt in order to protect privacy interest. This surveillance method is not qualitatively different that intercepting mail, which court has held violates 4A
* *Notes cases:
  * *Lewis v. US/Hoffa v. US* – Undercover agents who talked with defendants are constitutionally allowed to offer evidence against the defendant.
    * If the home were such a sacred area, then defendant's consent wouldn't be able to waive his privacy interest there
  * *On Lee v. US* – using a hidden microphone (strapped to an undercover officer) to gather evidence against the defendant is constitutional
  * *Silverman v. US* – police use spike mic to spy on the defendant, ruled unconstitutional because the spike mic trespassed on the defendant's private property

### *Katz v. United States* (1967)

* Facts: Wiretap placed on exterior of public phone booth without a warrant
* Holding:
  * Court rules that *Katz* was justified in expecting the contents of his call to be private, thus protected under 4th Amendment" when entering the booth and shutting the door
  * Introduces the "**reasonable expectation of privacy**" standard
    * Departure from the "trespass doctrine" which prohibited methods whereby government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area. Appears to displace this doctrine?
    * "**Fourth Amendment protects people, rather than places**"
    * Governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements

### *United States v. White* (1971)

* Background: "Misplaced trust" case where police obtained oral evidence by attaching wire to cooperating confidante of suspect. The government agents overheard these conversations through a wire-tap the informant was wearing
* Holding:
  * Court holds that there is no interest in case protected by 4th amendment, as it offers no protection to mistaken belief that a person who one voluntarily confides in won't reveal information
  * "However strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations...are not protected by the Fourth Amendment"
  * Pointing to case involving disclosure to undercover police agent, court similarly holds that recording by person acting on behalf of police does not constitute a search
* Dissent (Douglas, J.): Electronic surveillance is the modern means of eavesdropping; it is an assault on privacy and therefore should be regulated by 4th Amendment protections
* Dissent (Harlan, J.): The immediate relaying of info to government agents via electronic surveillance should be protected under 4th Amendment and a warrant should be required

### *Smith v. Maryland* (1979)

* Facts: Pen register case challenged on 4th Amendment grounds. Police arrest D based on information obtained via pen register installed on his phone without a warrant
* Holding:
  * Rules that **a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information that the person voluntarily turns over to third parties**
    * Applies to phone numbers, which are voluntarily conveyed to cell-carriers a means of establishing communication
    * Pen register did no constitute a search - privacy of what is said on the call is not infringed by this technique
      * **Content/non-content distinction**
    * Defendant “assumed the risk” that the company’s records “would be divulged to police.”
* Marshall Dissent - Privacy is not a discrete commodity. Such voluntary disclosures to a third party does not mean people have assumed the risk that the information will be passed on to the police. People have no practical alternative to using a telephone, so it's absurd to tell people they need to assume the risk of disclosure. Also, pen registers could be used by the government to halt political dissent, so their use should be regulated by warrants
* Stewart Dissent - Revealing who a person speaks with on the phone actually reveals intimate details about his or her life.There was a reasonable expectation of privacy here

### *Kyllo v. United States* (2001)

* Facts: Federal agents used thermal imaging device aimed at home to detect illegal activity occurring on the inside. Challenged on 4th Amendment grounds
* Holding:
  * Court holds that **where government uses advanced technology to explore details inside the home that would have previously been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a search and a warrant must be obtained**
    * Permitting this method would put homeowners at the mercy of advancing technology
    * Court has held for nearly a century that 4th Amendment draws firm line at entrance to house, thus to draw another arbitrary line for details that are not "intimate" would be both unpractical and a violation of that principle. Protections shouldn't be tied to the degree of intrusions into the home
* Dissent (Stevens): Heat from the home had entered the public domain and the police's observation of it was not a search. Plain view doctrine should apply here
* *CA v. Ciraolo* (Notes) – Police don't have to shield their eyes when driving past homes
  * Scalia thinks Katz imposed a requirement on top of that imposed in Olmstead rather than overruling it

### *United States v. Forrester* (2008)

* Background: Challenges to validity of surveillance mechanism, by which government monitored volume/destination of emails and web traffic, under the 4th amendment
* Holding:
  * Court cites both *Katz* (that expectation of privacy extends to the contents of a phone call) and *Smith* (that phone call metadata, rather than the contents, are captured using pen register and thus there is no violation)
  * Court finds this case analogous to *Smith* in that **there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for destination IP addresses when relying on 3rd party equipment to communicate** (i.e. route the traffic)
    * Like in *Smith*, the **contents of the communication are not revealed. Thus, court ruled method did not constitute a 4th amendment search**

### *United States v. Warshak* (2010)

* Facts: Government suspects Warshak of defrauding customers, so requests ISP preserve contents of emails and provide them without warrant
* Holding:
  * Court holds that **reasonable expectation of privacy extends to content of emails  stored with or sent/received through a commercial ISP, as it does to contents of communication over other mediums**
    * **Government may not compel an ISP to turn over the contents of a subscriber’s emails without a warrant**
    * ISP is the functional equivalent of post office or phone company, neither of which can be compelled to reveal contents of customer communications without a warrant
  
### *United States v. Jones* (2012)

* Facts: FBI attaches GPS on suspects truck to track movements after warrant had expired
* Holding: Plurality finds that this violated 4th Amendment protections against unlawful searches
* Scalia Opinion - A vehicle is an “effect” for Fourth Amendment purposes. Thus, the government’s installation of a GPS device on Jones’s vehicle constitutes a “search.” While acknowledging *Katz* still applies in cases involving communication signals where there is no trespass, the trespass here was clear and thus is the basis for the search's unlawfulness
  * Returns to formalistic property based standard, while acknowledging *Katz* still exists
* Concurrence (Sotomayor): Physical intrusion isn't the only way that the government can violate your privacy. Search is defined by the type of information take. Writes that *Smith* decision should be reconsidered to better suit digital age, however, Physical intrusion provides narrower basis for decision
* Alito Concurring in Judgement - Argues against application of trespass doctrine post-*Katz*. Invites legislative action to regulate these methods, but until then, the reasonable expectation test in *Katz* should apply. Majority fails to address the possibility that the government could violate your privacy without physical intrusion. The length/invasiveness of the tracking is the crucial factor
* Shadow Majority - Sotomayor joins Scalia majority despite appearing to adopt reasoning of Alito. This underscores need for additional clarity

### *Riley v. California* (2014)

* Facts: Police searched D incident to an arrest and seized his smartphone. The police searched the smartphone and used items found as evidence at D's trial on shooting charges brought by CA. D was convicted. On appeal, the court determined the warrantless search was a valid search incident to arrest
* Holding: Under 4th Amendment, the **government may not conduct a warrantless search of the contents of a cell phone seized incident to an arrest absent exigent circumstances**
  * Absent more precise guidelines, court generally determines whether to exempt search from warrant requirement by **assessing degree to which it intrudes privacy against the degree to which it is needed to protect government interests**
  * Searches incident to arrest are allowed only to ensure officer safety or to prevent the destruction of evidence. The interest in preserving evidence can be served by confiscating the phone and then waiting for a warrant to search it (you can put it in a black box if you really have to). Police can get more info from searching the phone than from searching an entire house.
    * Mosaic Theory – Allowing police to view which apps you use through the third party doctrine would allow them to make a complete picture of you
  * Concurrence (Alito): State legislatures are better suited to address this issue through new laws than federal courts are through 4th Amendment decisions

### *Carpenter v. United States* (2018)

* Background: Case where cell-site location information, which reveals location of phone based on nearest cell-tower, was obtained from carrier and used to convict suspect for involvement in robbery
* Holdings:
  * Court declines to extend "third party" principle articulated in *Smith*, in which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when information is voluntarily divulged with 3rd party, to the present circumstances
    * As technology advances, court acknowledges need to preserve degree of privacy 4th amendment intended to protect at time of adoption. It could not be foreseen, at time of *Smith*, a world in which phones are capable of tracking owners movements
  * Thus, **using CSLI to record an individual's movements over period of time constituted a search**. Individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy
* Majority Reasoning
  * CSLI does not “fit neatly under existing precedents,” and that it instead lies at the “intersection of two lines of cases” the first line addressing geolocation, and the second addressing the third-party doctrine
    * Geolocation
      * Roberts quotes Justice Alito’s *Jones* concurrence, noting that "longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy"
      * "Even greater privacy concerns than the GPS monitoring of a vehicle we considered in Jones," because a cell phone is almost a "feature of human anatomy" (quoting Riley) and "tracks nearly exactly the movements of its owner"
    * Third Party Doctrine
      * The services carriers provide are "such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life" that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society, thus cell phone location information is not truly ‘shared’ as one normally understands the term,
      * Apart from disconnecting the phone from the network, there is no way to avoid leaving behind a trail of location data. As a result, in no meaningful sense does the user voluntarily “assume[] the risk” of turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical movements
    * There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today
  * Conclusion: "the deeply revealing nature of CSLI, its depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach, and the inescapable and automatic nature of its collection," writing that "the fact that such information is gathered by a third party does not make it any less deserving of Fourth Amendment protection."
* Dissent
  * Court has twice held that individuals have no Fourth Amendment interests in business records which are possessed, owned, and controlled by a third party. Cell-site records are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process
    * This principle established in Miller and Smith should control
    * The defendants in those cases could expect that the third-party businesses could use the records the companies collected, stored, and classified as their own for any number of business and commercial purposes. The businesses were not bailee's or custodians of the records, with a duty to hold the records for the defendants’ use. The defendants could make no argument that the records were their own papers or effects
  * That line that the majority draws illogical and will frustrate principled application of the Fourth Amendment in many routine yet vital law enforcement operations
* Problems with Carpenter:
  * Creates even more uncertainty. Suggestions of a narrow ruling, meaning *Smith* 3rd party doctrine is still good law. Essentially a balancing act between privacy interests and disclosure
  * Balancing test might compromise away rights due to the immediacy of concerns which compel disclosure

### Workplace and Hotel Searches

* Work Issued Pagers (Notes)
  * Facts: Ontario, CA issued pagers to its police officers. Employees went over the word limit, sending personal messages and causing the city fees. The city obtained transcripts of the texts, which the officers argued was a violation of their 4th Amendment Rights
  * Holding: Regardless of whether officers had a right to privacy on the pagers, the **search was constitutional because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and not excessive in scope** (consistent with the court’s prior ruling in *O’Conor v. Ortega*)
    * Emphasized past decisions holding “operation realities” can reduce an employee’s privacy expectations and that these can be taken into account when considering if a workplace search is constitutional

## Overview of Surveillance-limiting Statutes

* Historic Statutes
  * Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 – nation’s first major anti-wiretapping statute
    * Provided that “No Person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance… of such intercepted communication to any person”
    * Did not prevent use of wiretaps – just restricted admissibility of evidence gained via wiretap into court
  * Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 – Nation’s second major statute limiting surveillance goes much further
    * Enacted same year as *Katz* (which recognized right to privacy in telephone communications) and *Berger v. New York* (found a state statute that regulated scope of electronic surveillance didn’t adequately protect 4th Amendment rights)
    * Attempted to establish strong privacy safeguards, recognizing also legitimate circumstances that may require use of surveillance
    * Regulated both face-to-face communications and telephone calls
    * Supplanted by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
* **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978** – passed to address special demands of national security and foreign espionage left open by *Katz*
  * Established a procedure through which government agencies could obtain expedited, top-secret approval for national security-related surveillance
* **Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986**
  * Addressed major developments in technology, such as the growth of email
  * Sought to overturn decision in *Smith v. Maryland* (third-party doctrine)
  * ECPA has been amended many times
  * Often referred to as Title III as it was technically an amendment to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act (Wiretap Statutes)
  * **Title I of ECPA – (Wireless and Electronic Communication Interception Act (“Wiretap Act”)**
    * Prohibits intercepting oral, wire, or electronic communications during their transmission
    * Covers landlines, cell phones, satellite communications, and emails in flight and in "transient storage" during transmission
  * **Title II of ECPA – Stored Wire and Electronic Communications Act (“Stored Communications Act”)**
    * Makes it a crime to obtain, alter, or block access to a wire or electronic communication in electronic storage
    * Governs access to stored email and voice mail
    * Also governs ISP’s ability to provide 3rd party access to user and subscriber data
  * **Title III of ECPA – Pen Register Act**
    * Regulates use of pen registers and capture of non-content portions of wire and electronic communications
    * Regulates called ID equipment and other “trap and trace” devices that capture outgoing/incoming phone numbers
* Digital Telephony Act of 1994 (“Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act,” “CALEA”)
  * Amended ECPA - Reflected concerns that emerging technologies would frustrate law enforcement surveillance
  * Requires telecommunication providers to modify their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure they have the necessary surveillance capabilities
  * Extended ECPA Title I to cordless phones (which were previously excluded based on their radio technology)
* **USA PATRIOT Act** - a.k.a Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
  * Aimed at facilitating the global war on terrorism, including domestic terrorism
  * Temporarily shifted stored wired communications from Wiretap Act to SCA, which has lower standard of approval and no exclusionary rule
  * Authorizes SCA warrants to be nationwide. Court can delay notice of search warrants if it concludes that there is reasonable cause that immediate notice will create an adverse result
* Cyber Security Enhancement Act of Homeland Security Act of 2002
  * Amended ECPA Title II to battle computer crimes and release ISP from liability for good faith disclosures to government of customer info in electronic storage
  * ECPA does not regulate video-only surveillance nor provide clear guidance on GPS or cell phone tower-based positioning data gathering
* USA Freedom Act
  * Ended bulk collection of telephone toll records

## ECPA Title I (Wiretap Act) and its Predecessor (Omnibus Crime Control - Title III)

* With Title III, Congress sought to regulate use of electronic surveillance as an investigative tool and disclosure of materials obtained through surveillance
* Purpose is to control conditions under which interception will be permitted to safeguard privacy of wire and oral communications
  * “Animating Title III is an overriding congressional concern with the protection of individual privacy”
  * Surveillance techniques are authorized only in investigations of serious offenses, is all subject to prior judicial approval which is issued in accordance to detailed application procedures and finding of probable cause
* Most clearly reflected in Title III’s strictly limited disclosure provisions, permitting disclosure of intercepted communications in 3 circumstances only:
  1. Law enforcement may disclose to another law enforcement officer to the extent required to perform duties
  1. Law enforcement can use the contents to extent appropriate to perform their duties
  1. While giving testimony under oath
* Explicitly authorizes recovery of civil damages by persons whose communications are disclosed in violation of the statute
* Richard Turkington: analysis of EPCA Title I (“Title III”) cases
  * 4 steps analysis should be utilized in evaluating Title I cases:
    1. Determine if there was an interception of a communication
    1. Determine whether there is a section 2517 exception
    1. Determine if interception satisfies section 2518 (which establishes the necessary procedure for obtaining court ordered electronic surveillance
    1. Consider applicability of a criminal sanction, civil remedy, or right to exclude

### Wiretap Act

* Only when normal methods of investigation are
infeasible
* Three types of communications:
  1. Wire communication – aural transfer made by wire
  1. Oral communication – utterance by a person
  1. Electronic communication – transfer of signals by wire or spectrum that is not wire or oral communications
* **18 U.S. Code § 2510 - Definitions**
  * Electronic communication - any transfer of signs, signals…of any nature by a wire, radio, electromagnetic…system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include:
    * Any wire/oral communication
    * Tone-only paging devices
    * Tracking devices
    * Electronic funds transfer information
  * Wire communication - any aural transfer made…by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection…furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing…such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications…and such term includes any electronic storage of such communication
  * Other definitions:
    * “Aural transfer” means a transfer containing the human voice at any point between and including the point of origin and the point of reception
    * “Intercept” means the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device
    * “Electronic, mechanical, or other device” means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than—(a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business
    * "Readily Accessible to the General Public” - means, with respect to a radio communication, that such communication is not—(A) scrambled or encrypted; (B) transmitted using modulation techniques that preserve the privacy of such communication;(C) carried on a subcarrier or other signal subsidiary to a radio transmission; (D) transmitted over a communication system provided by a common carrier, unless a tone only paging system
* **18 U.S. Code § 2511**
  * (1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who
    * (a) intentionally intercepts…any wire, oral, or electronic communication;
    * (b) intentionally uses…any electronic, mechanical, or other device to intercept any oral communication…
  * Shall be punished as provided in subsection (4) or shall be subject to suit as provided in subsection (5)
  * (2)
    * (g) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter or chapter 121 of this title for any person-
      * (i) to intercept or access an electronic communication made through an electronic communication system that is configured so that such electronic communication is readily accessible to the general public
    * (ii) to intercept any radio communication transmitted: (I) for the use of the general public or relates to ships, aircraft, vehicles, or persons in distress, (II) governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile, or public safety readily accessible to the public, (III) ham or CB, (IV) marine or aeronautical
* Application of Wiretap Act to Email
  * Electronic communications includes communications in transient storage intrinsic to communications process
  * Email not yet read is subject to the Wiretap Act
  * Email in pre- and post-transmission storage is governed by the SCA
* Application of Wiretap Act to Wi-Fi
  * Capturing payload data violates Wiretap Act
  * “Readily accessible the general public” applies only to “radio communication” like traditional radio

### Minimization Requirement - *Scott v. United States* (US Supreme Court – 1978)

* Facts: Title III requires wiretapping or electronic surveillance "be conducted in a way as to minimize" interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under Title 18 § 2518(5). Government got wiretap approval and agents intercepted for one month virtually all conversations of suspects. 40% of the calls were clearly narcotics related, and the remaining calls were for the most part short. D argues there was no good-faith effort to comply with minimization requirement, in violation of statute.
* Holding (Rehnquist):
  * Proper approach for evaluating compliance with the minimization requirement, like evaluation of all alleged violations of 4th Amendment, is **objectively to assess the agent's or officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time, without regard to his underlying intent or motive**
  * Even if agents fail to make good faith efforts at minimization, that is not itself a violation of the statute requiring suppression, since use of the word "conducted" in § 2518(5) makes clear the focus was to be on the agents' actions, not motives
  * Whether the way in which a wiretap was conducted is reasonable will depend on facts and circumstances of each case
    * % of non-pertinent calls intercepted not a sure guide to correct answer; also important to consider the circumstances of the wiretap (could be ambiguous or used coded/guarded language)
    * **Short and ambiguous nature of non-pertinent phone calls did not give the agents an opportunity to develop a category that should not have been intercepted, and hence their interception cannot be viewed as a violation of the minimization requirement**
* Dissent (Brennan): The minimization requirement was central to passage of Title III and the court is disregarding this in their majority decisions, as the minimization requirement was clearly violated by the agents

### Intercepting Emails In-Flight/Transient Storage: *United States v. Councilman* (1st Circuit – 2005)

* Facts: Interloc gave book dealer customers an e-mail address at the domain "interloc.com" and acted as the e-mail provider. CEO ordered employees to configure mail server to copy all incoming communications to subscriber dealers from Amazon.com (competitor). D contends the email messages were not “electronic communications” and the method they were copied was not “interception” under the Wiretap Act
* Issue - one of statutory construction
* Holding: 1st Circuit reviewed and holds that D's interpretations ere inconsistent with congresses intent
  * D infers that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of "electronic communication" regardless if still in the process of reaching end destination, simply because it was not specifically enumerated in the statute
  * ECPA text does not suggest whether or not electronic storage while in transmission falls under Wiretap Act. Court thus turns to legislative history, which it determines establishes that **electronic communication includes transient storage intrinsic to the communications process. Thus, the conduct in this case violated the Wiretap Act as copying this communication constitutes and "interception"**

### Intercepting Wifi Communications - Joffe v. Google Inc. (9th Circuit Court of Appeals – 2013)

* Facts: While capturing Street View photos, Google collected data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks (“payload data”). Google was sued under Wiretap Act
* Holding:
  * Wiretap Act exempts intercepting “electronic communications made through an electronic communication system” if the system is configured so that it is readily accessible to the general public (radio communication also exempted) – so Google argued its collections were exempted
  * Court agrees with Google that the definition of “readily accessible to the general public” apples to the §2511 exemption, when the communication in question is a radio communication
  * However the **“radio communication” in § 2510 excludes payload data and the court chooses to adopt the “common meaning” of the phrase “radio communication” (which is commonly understood to be “1) predominantly auditory and 2) broadcast”).** Therefore the data collected by Google is a violation of the Wiretap Act
  * If Congress has intended satellite to be encompassed in a “radio communication,” they wouldn’t have called it out separately. Thus, can't assume radio communications extends to things like satellite television

## ECPA Title II - Stored Communications Act

### Access to Stored Email - *Jennings v. Jennings* (Court of Appeals of South Carolina – 2012)
