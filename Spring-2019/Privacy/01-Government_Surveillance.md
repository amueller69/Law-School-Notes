# Government Surveillance

## 4th Amendment Cases

* **Olmstead v. United States (1928)**
  * Communications intercepted by tapping into telephone lines
  * Majority holds this did not violate 4th Amendment protection of information obtained by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area
    * Based on historical purpose of 4th Amendment, which was to prevent exercise of government force to search person, their house, or their effects against their will
    * Since there was no physical entry into the home or offices of the suspect, there was no unlawful search under 4A
    * Recites "trespass doctrine", which was exclusive controlling standard until *Katz*
  * Brandeis Dissent - As technology advances, court must adapt in order to protect privacy interest. This surveillance method is not qualitatively different that intercepting mail, which court has held violates 4A
* **Katz v. United States (1967)**
  * Wiretap placed on exterior of public phone booth without a warrant
  * Introduces the "reasonable expectation of privacy" standard
    * Departure from the "trespass doctrine" which prohibited methods whereby government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area
    * "Fourth Amendment protects people, rather than places"
    * Governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements
  * Court rules that Katz was justified in expecting the contents of his call to be private, thus protected under 4th Amendment" when entering the booth and shutting the door
* **United States v. White (1971)**
  * "Misplaced trust" case where police obtained oral evidence by attaching wire to cooperating confidante of suspect
  * Court holds that there is no interest in case protected by 4th amendment, as it offers no protection to mistaken belief that a person who one voluntarily confides in won't reveal information
    * "However strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations...are not protected by the Fourth Amendment"
    * Pointing to case involving disclosure to undercover police agent, court similarly holds that recording by person acting on behalf of police does not constitute a search
* **Smith v. Maryland (1979)**
  * Pen register case challenged on 4th Amendment grounds
  * Rules that person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information that the person voluntarily turns over to third parties
    * Applies to phone numbers, which are voluntarily conveyed to cell-carriers a means of establishing communication
    * Pen register did no constitute a search - privacy of what is said on the call is not infringed by this technique
    * Defendant “assumed the risk” that the company’s records “would be divulged to police.”
  * Dissent
    * Marshall - Privacy is not a discrete commodity. Such voluntary disclosures to a third party does not mean people have assumed the risk that the information will be passed on to the police
    * Stewart - Revealing who a person speaks with on the phone actually reveals intimate details about his or her life
* **Kyllo v. United States (2001)**
  * Use of thermal imaging device aimed at private home to detect illegal activity was challenged
  * Court holds that where government uses advanced technology to explore details inside the home that would have previously been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a search and a warrant must be obtained
    * Permitting this method would put homeowners at the mercy of advancing technology
    * Court has held for nearly a century that 4th Amendment draws firm line at entrance to house, thus to draw another arbitrary line for details that are not "intimate" would be both unpractical and a violation of that principle
* **United States v. Forrester (2008)**
  * Challenges to validity of surveillance mechanism, by which government monitored volume/destination of emails and web traffic, under the 4th amendment
  * Court cites both *Katz* (that expectation of privacy extends to the contents of a phone call) and *Smith* (that phone call metadata, rather than the contents, are captured using pen register and thus there is no violation)
  * Court finds this case analogous to *Smith* in that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for destination IP addresses when relying on 3rd party equipment to communicate (i.e. route the traffic)
    * Like in *Smith*, the contents of the communication are not revealed. Thus, court ruled method did not constitute a 4th amendment search
* **United States v. Warshak (2010)**
  * Government suspects Warshak of defrauding customers, so requests ISP preserve contents of emails and provide them without warrant
  * Court holds that reasonable expectation of privacy extends to content of emails as it does to contents of communication over other mediums
    * ISP is the functional equivalent of post office or phone company, neither of which can be compelled to reveal contents of customer communications without a warrant
* **United States v. Jones (2012)**
  * FBI attaches GPS on suspects truck to track movements after warrant had expired
  * Plurality finds that this violated 4th Amendment protections against unlawful searches
  * Scalia Opinion - A vehicle is an “effect” for Fourth Amendment purposes. Thus, the government’s installation of a GPS device on Jones’s vehicle constitutes a “search.” While acknowledging *Katz* still applies in cases involving communication signals where there is no trespass, the trespass here was clear and thus is the basis for the search's unlawfulness
  * Alito Concurrence - Argues against application of trespass doctrine post-*Katz*. Invites legislative action to regulate these methods, but until then, the reasonable expectation test in *Katz* should apply
* **Carpenter v. United States (2018)**
  * Case where cell-site location information, which reveals location of phone based on nearest cell-tower, was obtained from carrier and used to convict suspect for involvement in robbery
  * Court declines to extend "third party" principle articulated in *Smith*, in which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when information is voluntarily divulged with 3rd party, to the present circumstances
    * As technology advances, court acknowledges need to preserve degree of privacy 4th amendment intended to protect at time of adoption. It could not be foreseen, at time of *Smith*, a world in which phones are capable of tracking owners movements
  * Thus, using CSLI to record an individual's movements constituted a search
    * Individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy
