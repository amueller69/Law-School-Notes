# Rape

* Trajectory of Rape Laws
  * Rape laws do not look alike across the states. Some are more traditional and others are more modern
  * The role of the MPC has not been a significant here, states continue to adhere to their own autonomy on the issue of the actus reus of rape
  * While this section traces the progression from the traditional perspective to the modern one, this is not to say that states don’t still hold on to the entirety or pieces of the traditional perspective

## Actus Reus

### Force and Resistance

* Force Requirement
  * The traditional rule is that successful prosecution for forcible rape requires proof that:
    1. The female did not consent
    1. Sexual intercourse was secured by force
  * If there was lack of consent, but no force, a rape conviction could not be upheld
  * Notwithstanding the private threshold of unacceptable behavior, proof of force was and often still is an essential prerequisite for a criminal conviction of rape in many American jurisdictions
    * Growing number of jurisdictions (thought still a minority) now criminalize all forms of non-consensual intercourse
    * Where force is still required, those courts typically insist it must go beyond that incidental/inherent to the sexual act (something more than the sexual act itself)
  * Implicit and Nonphysical Threats
    * Under traditional doctrine, force required had to be the kind that was likely to cause serious bodily injury. Non-physical did not ordinarily constitute force
    * Courts have increasingly criticized notion of force being analogous to a fight, arguing this gives men right to intimidate and exploit fear of victims. They have also pointed out need for statutory reform in order to make room for cases where the element of physical force is lacking
    * Many states have adopted this reasoning by extending the definition of force to cases where consent is obtained by duress, coercion, extortion, or using a position of authority
    * Pennsylvania adopted statute defining "forcible compulsion" as "compulsion by use of physical, intellectual, moral, emotional or psychological force either express or applied"
* Resistance requirement
  * While sometimes formally required in statute, resistance requirement is more often implicit in the elements of force and non-consent
    * Traditionally, a showing of physical resistance "to the utmost" was required to establish required element of force
  * Clear policy issues with strict resistance requirement
    * Resistance can be physically dangerous to the victim. Victims of rape also frequently freeze during sexual assaults
  * Half states still require reasonable resistance, though even here there are exceptions
  * Reasonable apprehension - Requirement that, where lack of resistance out of fear, this fear be reasonably grounded. Potential justification: D should reasonably know that victim is submitting out of fear
* *State v. Rusk* (1981) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D met victim at bar, victim gave D a ride home and D asked her to come upstairs.  Victim declined, but D took her keys.  Victim claimed she felt scared by D’s look so she agreed to go upstairs.  Victim entered D’s apartment and did not attempt to leave before they had sex.  D denied victim’s story.  D convicted of rape, but D argued insufficient evidence of lack of consent
  * Holding - In a charge of rape, the lack of consent may be established by proof of resistance or by proof that the victim failed to resist due to a genuine and reasonably grounded fear (including, but not limited to, a fear of death or serious bodily harm, or a fear so extreme as to preclude resistance, or a fear which would render her incapable of continuing to resist, or a fear that so overpowers her that she does not dare resist). The reasonableness of P's apprehension of fear was solely a question of fact for the jury to determine. There was also the physical element of choking and the response, which might otherwise satisfy the resistance requirement
* *State v. DiPetrillo* (2007)(R.I.)
  * Facts - First degree sexual assault case in the context of an employer-employee relationship. Clear physical resistance. Trial judge found that between the physical actions and implied threats based on D's authority over P, all elements of the offense were satisfied.
  * Holding - Court declines to extend analysis of implied threats used in *Burke* (psychological-pressure-on-vulnerable-victim analysis in police officer case) to the context of an employment relationship. Since trial decision didn't make clear whether physical actions alone were enough to constitute force, case was remanded

### Eliminating the Force Requirement

* Many states now prohibit non-forcible forms of non-consensual sexual acts, which are divided into different degrees
  * Shift in social perspective of rape might be partially responsible for this. Rape no longer viewed exclusively as a crime of violence, but as a violation of autonomy and privacy. Invades personal inner space and abridges right to determine with whom and when to have sexual intimacy. Also viewed as degrading act of sexual domination
* Potential Concerns
  * Does this leave room for a MoF defense? If the attendant circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that they had consent, despite no verbal affirmative "yes", should they be culpable?
* *State in the Interests of MTS* (1992) (NJ CoLR)
  * Facts - D in victim’s bed and began having sex before victim told D to stop. Victim claimed that she was asleep when D went into her bed. D denied victim’s story. D convicted of rape, and CoA reversed on finding of no physical force
  * Holding - **A rape charge may be sustained if the victim does not affirmatively express consent verbally or physically based on a reasonable person standard even without evidence of threat or use of force**. A reasonable person would not assume that victim had given affirmative permission to D, thus trial jury finding should be upheld
  * Significance: This case is a demonstration of courts departing from the traditional rape standard requiring resistance by victim (i.e. it isn't rape unless victim fights back). Focus should be on D's behavior and courts must avoid defining “force” in such a way as to make the establishment of a crime turn on the victim’s behavior. Under this type of definition, “force” can exist if the defendant performs sexual penetration without freely-given consent. **Even the force inherent in the sexual act itself, justifies a forcible sexual assault prosecution.**
    * Under this standard, consent is the only factual issue (aside from mens rea) that would distinguish lawful conduct from ahe criminal offense
* *M.C. v. Bulgaria* (1998)(ECHR)
  * Facts - Victim (14yo girl) forced to have sex with D’s (two 20yo boys) and victim did not physically resist because she was too weak but verbally told them to stop several times. Bulgaria prosecutor dropped charges because insufficient evidence of physical resistance
  * Holding - Under the European Convention on Human Rights, a member state must effectively investigate and prosecute any non-consensual sexual act involving the absence of physical resistance by the victim
    * **Non-consent is the primary element of rape, NOT use of force** (consists not only of direct violence, but also placing the victim in position where submission is believed to be only option)
    * Member states should penalize any sexual act committed against non-consenting persons even if they do not shown signs of resistance. Analysis of member states shows that this definition is already widely operational
    * Rudovsky - Extraordinary case because it disregards prosecutor’s discretion to pursue or drop cases

### Absence of Consent

* Modern rape law states that force is implied by non-consent. This is consistent with the shift that took place above in which that inherent in the sexual act itself constitutes as force. Thus consent becomes the critical piece
* Is consent a state of mind (something person feels) or an action (something someone does or says)?
  * Subjective Consent – A female, in her mind, may want intercourse or not want it, but she may fail to manifest her wishes outwardly. There’s no need to manifest it outwardly
  * Objective Consent – Consent may be an expressive or external concept – it exists when permission is given verbally. Consent is absent without an external affirmative ‘yes’
  * Law traditionally required non-consent in both forms (subjective willingness and physical acts of refusal)
  * Nobody defends strict insistence on requirement for physical (as opposed to verbal) resistance anymore, however there still remains questions about what needs to be proved?
    * Affirmative no? Absence of a yes? Body language?
* Issues with Consent
  * Miscalculation - If purely subjective consent approach, potential of miscalculation by the other party arises given rise to mens rea issue
  * Involuntary Objective Consent - A person may say “yes” to sex but the degree to which this is voluntary is debateable in some instances. There may be other forces at work. Should this "yes" be enough notwithstanding the full circumstances?
  * Withdrawn Consent - Most jurisdictions hold post-penetration withdrawal of consent does not convert continuing intercourse into rape – even if threats of force are clear. This presents a clear issue
* Defective consent
  * Maturity - Statutes draw bright line by setting specific age of consent on of concerns for young person's capacity to make a mature decision (Statutory Rape)
    * Reflects social goal of deterring teen pregnancy and the risk of implicit coercion
    * Intellectual disability is another ground for invalidating consent
  * Incapacity - Liability for rape where person in unconscious or severely incapacitated by drugs or alcohol
    * Laws vary widely, though drugging or spiking someone and then have sex them is uniformly considered rape
      * Incapacitation short of unconsciousness or caused by someone other than D is not considered rape under many statutes
    * With Alcohol, general rule is that if person is unable to make reasonable judgement as to the nature/consequences of the conduct, then it is rape
  * Authority and Trust - Outside of context of psychiatrist-patient relationships, criminal law generally does not invalidate consent in adult relationships
  * Fraud
    * The law holds that that **fraud-in-the-inducement does not vitiate consent** under the common law, the law treats the intercourse as consensual
    * BUT, a female’s consent to engage in sexual intercourse is invalid if, as a result of fraud she, is unaware that she has consented to the act of sexual intercourse itself. This is called **fraud-in-factum**
      * Ex: D, a physician, is guilty of rape if he obtains permission from his patient to “insert an instrument” in her vagina while she is under anaesthesia, if the ‘instrument’ used is his penis

## Mens Rea

### Mistake of Fact

* *Commonwealth v. Sherry* (1982) (MA CoLR)
  * Facts - Victim at party with D’s (co-physicians). D’s took victim by car to one of D’s houses and had sex after the victim had asked to be taken home, but otherwise D didn’t resist. D claims she felt numb and didn’t physically resist. Ds argue that jury should have been instructed to find without a reasonable doubt that they possessed actual knowledge of victim's lack of consent
  * Holding - A rape victim is not required to use physical force to resist and any resistance which demonstrates that her lack of consent is honest and real shall suffice. There is no recognized defense related to honest mistake of fact without considering the reasonableness of the mistake
* *Commonwealth v. Fischer* (1998) (PA CoLR)
  * Facts - On the night of alleged sexual misconduct, D and victim had previous consensual sex. Later, D and victim met again.  Victim claims D held her down and attempted to initiate. D claims he stopped when victim said to stop and that victim left after D tried to initiate again; D claims he mistakenly thought victim consented
  * Holding - Mistake of facts on grounds that a victim previously consented to a defendant’s sexual conduct is not enough to deviate from precedent (stating that defense based on reasonable belief of consent must be established by legislature)
* Strict Liability
  * Mass. App. Ct. case in which court refused to acknowledge this defense even where belief that victim consented were reasonable. This holding was based on analogy to age based statutory rape cases
  * This may have harmful consequences. If a D genuinely and reasonably believes there is consent, then he is acting without moral culpability. The effect of dispensing with the reasonable mistake of fact doctrine is, effectively, to covert rape – a felony carrying very serious penalty – into a strict liability offense
  * This is the case in states like MA, whereas Alaska's rule is the reverse – prosecution must prove that the defendant KNEW there was no consent
  * Most states still recognize this defense where reasonable, but varies from state to state. Some states (e.g. CA) have become increasingly hesitant to instruct juries unless there is substantial evidence of conduct by female which would reasonably lead to belief of consent

## Potential Statutory Solutions

### Model Penal Code

* §213.0 Definitions
  * Consent: Person's behavior, including words and conduct (action or inaction), that communicate a willingness to engage in a specific act of sexual conduct (see *MTS*; *Bulgaria*)
  * Behavior does not constitute consent when the result of incapacity or duress
  * Consent given expressly by words OR implicitly by conduct based on circumstances
  * Lack of resistance does not establish consent, though may be considered in light of circumstances
  * Consent is revocable at any time
  * NOTE: original version wanted strict “yes” requirement, but voted as too strict and revised
* §213.1 - Forcible Rape
  1. Actor is guilty of Aggravated Forcible rape if violates forcible rape statue and in doing so recklessly or knowingly does the following in order to cause the victim to engage in the act:
     * Uses deadly weapon
     * Acts with active participation or assistance of others
     * Causes serious bodily injury
  1. Guilty of forcible rape if knowingly or recklessly does the following in order to cause the victim to engage in the act:
     * Uses physical force, physical restraint, or implied/express threat of physical force, bodily injury, or physical restraint
     * Threatens to inflict bodily injury on someone else or commit any other crime of violence
* §213.2 - Penetration Without Consent
  * 4th degree felony to engage in act of sexual penetration where knowingly or recklessly disregards other persons lack of consent
* §213.3 - Rape or Penetration of Vulnerable Person
  * Second degree rape of vulnerable person if engages in act of sexual penetration and knowingly/recklessly disregards that the person is:
    * Sleeping, unconscious, or physically unable to communicate
    * Unable to refuse due to mental disorder/disability
    * Unable to appraise conduct due to intoxicating/mind-altering substances the actor administered in order to cause such impairment
  * Third degree sexual penetration of vulnerable person if knowingly/recklessly disregards:
    * Mentally/developmentally disabled or otherwise mentally incapacitated so as not to understand nature of act
    * Disabled to extent that victim posses capacity person no more than 12 years old and that of actor is greater than 16
* §213.4 Sexual Penetration by Coercion or Exploitation
  1. By Coercion (third-degree felony)
     * Knowingly/Recklessly obtains consent by threatening to
       * Accuse of crime or get deported
       * Take or withhold action in official capacity (or cause another person to do so), whether public or private
       * Inflict any economic harm that would not benefit the actor
     * Obtains consent while knows or recklessly disregards that:
       * Person is detained in institution where actor holds position of authority
       * Under arrest, supervision, or in-treatment where actor holds position of authority
  1. By Exploitation (fourth degree felony)
     * Engages in act of sexual penetration and knowingly:
       * Is providing professional treatment/counseling/monitoring for emotional/mental issue to non-spousal/partner person, regardless of where it happens or if actor is qualified to provide this
       * Misrepresents medical properties of the act
       * Leads person to believe falsely that actor is personally known to them

## Evidentiary Concerns

* Evidentiary rules may be more important than the way we define rape itself
* Concern between actus rea and mens rea, as well as a pervasive concern that it is “easy” to blame someone for rape, have lead to general prescriptions relating to proof of rape that have waxed and waned over time. It is worth noting that false accusations are very rare. Rape is actually severely under-reported. However, there are still concerns about bias or leaps
  * Corroboration: “Currently, no American state requires corroboration in all forcible rape cases.” This traditionally required corroboration of victim testimony. There are theoretically arguments for corroboration in order to get a conviction – and historically this was the case – but today, defense attorneys can do the work necessary to discredit a plaintiff or suggest to the jury that the situation is murky
  * Special Jury Instruction: It used to be the case that many jurisdictions would require rape jury instructions to include a statement on how easily made rape accusations are and difficult to defend against. These have fallen out of style
  * Cross Examination: Issues of credibility and abusive treatment of victims
    * Credibility - Since availability of mistake of fact defense is limited and the standard of consent is more friendly to the victim, the obvious target of the defense is naturally the victim's credibility. The primary issue in the court room become when women should be believed and appeals to age old gender-bias are often used to sway this issue in D's favor
    * Can a plaintiff’s prior sexual history be included (or what they wore) to suggest a “loose reputation” making consent plausible?
      * Under the rules of evidence, “background circumstances like the complainant’s prior sexual experience are presumptively admissible, whenever the crucial fact (such as consent) is more likely to be true when those circumstances are present than when they are not. By this standard, it was considered plausible that evidence of prior sexual activity might sometimes have at least some probative value”
      * The difficulty with this is that introducing such evidence is likely over- weighted by juries (thus more prejudicial) or has such an effect on the alleged victim, that it’s hard to get it in or doesn’t make sense from a strategy point of view
      * Generally the probative value standard relates to CIVL rather than CRIMINAL cases. It’s harder to get it in on the criminal side
    * *State v. DeLawder* (1975)
      * Court denies admission of evidence purporting to show victim had engaged in acts with other men and that victim fabricated story out of fear of telling her mother
      * Holding: A defendant has a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to engage in cross-examination of an accuser and to introduce evidence so as to establish bias, prejudice, or ulterior motive in an attempt to diminish the accuser’s credibility.
* Shield Laws:
  * Just about every state has rape shield laws to limit the admissibility of evidence related to the plaintiff’s prior sexual behavior
  * **The exception is that “some state statutes admit evidence of sexual history only when it involves prior incidents with the defendant.”**
* Rule of Evidence 412. Any evidence of plaintiff’s sexual behavior is not allowed, EXCEPT:
  * To allow evidence to show someone other than the defendant raped the victim
  * Evidence of prior sexual behavior of the victim with the defendant to prove consent
    * *Not all states allow this*
  * Evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial
    * Example Hypo: Young woman was dating on and off the defendant. Sexual assault allegation. A week before trial, the defense attorney gets her journal diary where she says “I feel like Nate is such a player – he was trying to get with me and Holly while he had a girlfriend…maybe that’s why I jumped on him…I don’t feel too guilty for him”
      * Prosecutor says this is inadmissible…previous sex acts of plaintiff are not allowed
      * Defendant would probably argue that while this is prejudicial, it’s so relevant that not to include would be mean D doesn’t get a fair trial
* Rule of Evidence 413. A defendants (but not plaintiffs) prior sexual misconduct can be admitted.
