# Rape

* Evidentiary rules may be more important than the way we define rape itself

## Actus Reus

### Force and Resistance

* Force Requirement
  * Notwithstanding the private threshold of unacceptable behavior, proof of force was and often still is an essential prerequisite for a criminal conviction of rape in American jurisdictions
    * Growing number of jurisdictions (thought still a minority) now criminalize all forms of non-consensual intercourse
    * Where force is still required, those courts typically insist it must go beyond that incidental/inherent to the sexual act
  * Implicit and Nonphysical Threats
    * Courts have increasingly criticized notion of force being analogous to a fight, arguing this gives men right to intimidate and exploit fear of victims. They have also pointed out need for statutory reform in order to make room for cases where the element of physical force is lacking
    * MPC §213.1(2) permits a conviction for "gross sexual imposition" in cases where submission is compelled by threat of force or "by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution". Many states use a similar approach by extending it to cases where consent is obtained by duress, coercion, extortion, or using a position of authority
    * Pennsylvania adopted statute defining "forcible compulsion" as "compulsion by use of physical, intellectual, moral, emotional or psychological force either express or applied"
* Resistance requirement
  * While sometimes formally required in statute, resistance requirement is more often implicit in the elements of force and non-consent
  * Half states still require reasonable resistance, though even here there are exceptions
  * Reasonable apprehension - Requirement that, where lack of resistance out of fear, this fear be reasonably grounded. Potential justification: D should reasonably know that victim is submitting out of fear
* *State v. Rusk* (1981) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D met victim at bar, victim gave D a ride home and D asked her to come upstairs.  Victim declined, but D took her keys.  Victim claimed she felt scared by D’s look so she agreed to go upstairs.  Victim entered D’s apartment and did not attempt to leave before they had sex.  D denied victim’s story.  D convicted of rape, but D argued insufficient evidence of lack of consent
  * Holding - In a charge of rape, the lack of consent may be established by proof of resistance or by proof that the victim failed to resist due to a genuine and reasonably grounded fear (including, but not limited to, a fear of death or serious bodily harm, or a fear so extreme as to preclude resistance, or a fear which would render her incapable of continuing to resist, or a fear that so overpowers her that she does not dare resist). The reasonableness of P's apprehension of fear was solely a question of fact for the jury to determine. There was also the physical element of choking and the response, which might otherwise satisfy the resistance requirement
* *State v. DiPetrillo* (2007)(R.I.)
  * Facts - First degree sexual assault case in the context of an employer-employee relationship. Clear physical resistance. Trial judge found that between the physical actions and implied threats based on D's authority over P, all elements of the offense were satisfied.
  * Holding - Court declines to extend analysis of implied threats used in *Burke* (psychological-pressure-on-vulnerable-victim analysis in police officer case) to the context of an employment relationship. Since trial decision didn't make clear whether physical actions alone were enough to constitute force, case was remanded

### Eliminating the Force Requirement

* Potential Concerns
  * Does this leave room for a MoF defense? If the attendant circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that they had consent, despite no verbal affirmative "yes", should they be culpable?
* *State in the Interests of MTS* (1992) (NJ CoLR)
  * Facts - D in victim’s bed and began having sex before victim told D to stop. Victim claimed that she was asleep when D went into her bed. D denied victim’s story. D convicted of rape, and CoA reversed on finding of no physical force
  * Holding - A rape charge may be sustained if the victim does not affirmatively express consent verbally or physically based on a reasonable person standard even without evidence of threat or use of force. A reasonable person would not assume that victim had given affirmative permission to D, thus trial jury finding should be upheld
  * Significance: This case is a demonstration of courts departing from the traditional rape standard requiring resistance by victim (i.e. it isn't rape unless victim fights back). Focus should be on D's behavior and courts must avoid defining “force” in such a way as to make the establishment of a crime turn on the victim’s behavior. Under this type of definition, “force” can exist if the defendant performs sexual penetration without freely-given consent
