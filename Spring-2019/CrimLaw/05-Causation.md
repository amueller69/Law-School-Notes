# Causation

## General Overview

* Determination of causation is part of the actus reus analysis
  * It links the “voluntary act” of the actus reus and the resulting social harm
  * Actus reus thus has 3 components that must be satisfied: Voluntary Act, Causation, Social Harm
* Issue of causation appears primarily in homicide cases. Occasionally appears in non-homicide cases, but almost always related to homicide
* Causation is Mainly a Retributive Concept
  * There’s no reason why D should not be responsible for V’s death if we can prove that, had X not intervened, D’s bullet surely would have killed V. The act seems just as culpable. From an deterrence/incentive side, it doesn’t make sense to under charge to 'attempted murder'
  * Role of causation finds it primary moral justification in retributive just deserts. Given the stakes of criminal convictions, the principle of causation is an instrument society employs to ensure that criminal responsibility is personal
* As in tort law, causation has two constituent parts that must be satisfied: **But-for causation** and **proximate causation**
  * Criminal law causation is in no way linked to Tort law and its underlying doctrines and standards related causation
    * Different aims. Tort law causation attempts to place liability on the party who's conduct is most culpable for P's harm (apportionment). Criminal law is concerned with the level of culpability necessary to justify punishment (deterrence and retribution)
    * The severe consequences that follow from criminal liability provide a strong argument for a stricter standard of causation than that in tort law
* Most state codes include no explicit rules for determining causation. In these jurisdictions, courts are left to decide based on evolving common law principles
  * MPC §2.03 seeks to articulate an appropriate standard and roughly a dozen states have adopted it

## But-For Causation

* But-For Causation - There can be no criminal responsibility for resulting social harm unless it can be shown that the defendant’s conduct was a cause-in-fact of the prohibited result
  * Ask: But for D’s voluntary acts, would the social harm have occurred when it did?
* But-For Causation Actus Reus Problems
  * In order to convict, you need the full actus reus (act, harm), causation (but for AND proximate cause), and mens rea. Without any component, you can’t convict
  * Causation without Mens Rea – D has an argument with husband V. V is upset and storms out of the house. He walks across the street in a fury and in the process is stroked and killed by X’s car. Did D cause the harm?
    * Probably Not. You have a strong “but-for” and “causation” argument. But even still, D can’t be convicted. He didn’t have the mens rea. This is ‘but-for’ causation without the mens rea
  * Mens Rea without Causation – D shoots at V intending to kill, but misses. Y simultaneously, independently, and accidentally shoots V in the heart. Is D guilty?
    * Probably Not. D may have intended to kill (he can get attempted murder) but D did not cause V’s death. Likewise, Y may have caused the death, but he lacks the requisite mens rea for a first degree murder charge (though depending on how reckless, he might get third degree or manslaughter)

### *State v. Montoya* (2002) NM CoLR

* Facts - Accomplice of D shot and severely wounded. D drove accomplice to secluded area and left him to die. D convicted of murder on theory that D prevented accomplice from getting medical help, but D argued evidence only established accomplice may have survived w/ treatment.
* Holding - D wins appeal. Court rules that D is **liable ONLY if established beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct is the cause in-fact of victim’s death**

### *State v. Muro* (2005) (Neb CoLR)

* Facts - D came home and found daughter w/ a fractured skull. D waited 4 hours before seeking medical attention. D convicted of causing daughter’s death by failing to seek immediate medical attention
* Holding - D **criminally liable ONLY if established beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct is the cause in-fact of victim’s death**. Only the possibility of survival existed with earlier treatment, thus no but-for beyond reasonable doubt. D wins on appeal

### *Burrage v U.S.* (2014) (SCOTUS)

* Facts: 20 year mandatory minimum for distributing drugs that lead to death. V dies and cocktail of mixed drugs found in autopsy. Expert testimony that heroin sold by D was a contributing factor in the death, as it was part of the mix of drugs. Possible V could still have died without the heroin
* Holding: SCOTUS holds that there’s no but-for causation because it’s not certain that D's conduct was an independently sufficient cause. Uncertain about precisely how much the chance of death increased as a result of the heroin. **Uncertainty of this type cannot be reconciled with beyond a reasonable doubt standard.**

## Proximate Causation

* Most causation problems present issues related to only proximate causation
* There are two situations where proximate cause is present:
  1. Direct Proximate Cause – When D shoots V and V dies instantly or soon after, it’s pretty clear that the shooting was a direct cause of death. An act that is a direct cause of social harm is also a proximate cause of it (easy and straightforward)
  1. Proximate Intervening Causes – Notwithstanding an intervening cause – an independent force that is another but-for cause – that operates in producing the social harm after the defendant’s voluntary act has been committed, the initial voluntary act is still such that it is sufficiently culpable
* The purpose of the but-for test of causation is to identify the candidates for responsibility for an event. From this pool, which may include other human actors and non-human forces stemming over an extended period of time, the “proximate” cause of the social harm must be selected
  * Examples of these problems: Intervening causes of nature, third parties, etc.
  * When these problems aries, the proximate cause analysis is concerned with two primary questions:
    1. When is the intervening conduct – of a third party, the victim, or a natural force – sufficiently out of the ordinary that it is no longer fair to say that the social harm was caused by the Defendant’s conduct?
       * Even if not unforeseeable or out of the ordinary, what are the exceptions (e.g. autonomy)?
    1. Put differently, under what circumstances should D, who acts with the requisite mens rea, and who commits a voluntary act that is but-for causation of a social harm, be relieved of criminal responsibility because of an intervening proximate cause?
* Omissions as Causes
  * Example: Intruder pushes baby into pool, babysitter refuses to rescue and child drowns. Can it be said that in failing to come to child's aid, the babysitter caused the death?
    * The babysitter's omission was indeed a necessary condition and was thus a but-for cause
    * Does it follow that all bystanders causally contributed? Are these omissions non-culpable in the absence of some duty to act?
  * Courts are uniformly willing to treat an omission as the legal cause of a result in situations where there is a duty to act
* Transferred Intent  
  * D shoots at V1 intended to kill him, but bullet misses and ricochets. It strikes and kills V2. Is D guilty of murder regardless of foreseeability?
    * All jurisdictions say D is guilty, reasoning that the intent to kill V1 transfers to his action that ultimately harmed V2
      * Has the same blameworthy mental state and blameworthy result
  * MPC would also convict D in this situation, holding a person is guilty of intentionally causing a certain result even if it accidentally inflicts the harm on a person while intentionally trying to inflict it on another
  * Problems
    * If D succeeds in inflicting harm on intended person while harming another person in the process, is the intent still transferred or is it "used up"
    * If D shoots at V1 intending to kill and V2 kills pedestrian with car while trying to escape, is the intent transferred to this scenario?
* Assisted Suicide
  * Prevailing American law: One who successfully urges or assists another to commit suicide is not guilty of murder at least so long as the V was mentally responsible and was not forced or deceived
  * Most states also reject possibility of negligent homicide or manslaughter, provided that V's action were indeed voluntary
    * Possible exception for negligent/reckless aid? (e.g. V is in state of mind where choice cannot be said to be free or voluntary)
  * MPC permits conviction of criminal homicide for causing individual to take their own life "only if he purposely causes such suicide by force, duress, or deception"
  * However, majority of states define separate statutory offense for assisting in suicide that is a felony that is the punishable equivalent of manslaughter
  * Seems to conflict with foreseeability standard of proximate cause. Surely Dr. Death knew his actions would have the precise effect that they did in causing death
    * Distinction between human action in physical events is embodied in the principles of causation. Human action caused by initial actor's conduct is not treated the same as physical events which are subject to laws of nature. In the former, the "resultant" human action is chosen by the second person alone
    * The principle of autonomy teaches that the individual's will is the prime cause of behavior
    * Qualification on this special treatment: **Subsequent human actions are only independent when they are freely and voluntarily chosen**
* Subsequent Action Problems
  * Subsequent victim actions - Somewhat similar to assisted suicide; where subsequent action of the victim, in response to D's initial action, causally contributes to their harm. Is D's initial act such that he is culpable for harm that results from the choices of the victim (autonomy problem)?
  * Subsequent third party actions - Exposing the victim to homicidal third-parties. Does this make D blameworthy for the actions of others? Does it matter that the third-party actions were foreseeable?
    * One perspective: A person is only responsible for what he himself does. The doer of the final act whom autonomously intervenes should bear sole responsibility for the resulting harm
    * What if deliberately misleading a third party to commit the harm?

### Proximate Causation Cases

### *People v Acosta* (1991) (CA Appel)
  
* Facts: Intense car chase. In pursuit, two police helicopters crash killing the pilots. Is D responsible?
* Holding - But for causation is clear, but proximate causation would depend on foreseeability. Trier of fact's finding of proximate cause was appropriate based on objective standard of reasonableness
* Reasoning
  * Proximate cause is term historically used to separate those results for which actor will be held responsible from those not carrying such responsibility. Legal fiction serving matters of policy based partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice
  * If not a factual cause (but-for), then no need to even consider proximate causation
  * Standard for proximate cause should exclude extraordinary results and allow the trier of fact to sense of common man (objective)
  * In choosing to engage in high-speed escape from police, within D's reasonable apprehension that the police may be harmed in the pursuit
  * **Since the result was possible consequences that could have been reasonably contemplated, a finding of proximate cause is appropriate**

### *People v. Brady* (2005) (CA Appel)
  
* Facts - D recklessly started a fire in meth lab. Two firefighting planes went to fight fire, but one pilot made an error and the planes collided, killing both pilots. D convicted of causing both deaths, D argued not sufficient cause
* Holding - Deaths foreseeable given location of the fire (it would require extraordinary efforts to control it), thus proximate cause established

### *People v. Arzon* (1978) (NY Appel)

* Facts:D intentionally set fire on fifth floor of abandoned building. Firefighters respond to fire that D started at which point an independent fire is discovered on the second floor. Second floor fire kills firefighter attempting to evacuate building. D indicted for arson and second-degree murder (based on recklessness evincing depraved disregard for human life). D argued no causal link between the fifth floor fire and the fireman’s death
* Holding: Court upholds finding that **D was responsible because conduct was but-for cause and ultimate harm should have been reasonably foreseen. Ultimate harm need not be intended by actor, so long as harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to the conduct. Irrelevant that it ws not sole and exclusive factor in V's death or that intervening factor contributed to ultimate harm. Result was certainly foreseeable that fire set would expose responders to life-threatening risk**

### *Warner Lambert* (1980) (NY CoLR)
  
* Facts - D’s gum factory explodes killing workers b/c D failed to take safety precautions; D acquitted of second-degree manslaughter. D’s convicted of IVM (negligence), but D’s argue no criminal culpability
* Holding  - Court rejects theory that But-For causation is sole requirement and that it is irrelevant which chain of events actually caused the harm (i.e. D is culpable for simply exposing to the potential harm by employing them). It holds that D's **conduct must be “sufficiently direct cause” of victim’s death because criminal negligence requires higher standard than civil negligence**

### *State v. Shabazz* (CT 1998)

* Facts - D fatally stabbed victim, but victim died from malpractice while being treated at hospital
* Holding - D criminally liable if D’s despite other contributing factors including negligence on behalf of the hospital treating V. **Gross negligence by a third party is only a defense when the negligence is the sole cause of the death**. At most, the hospital's negligence can be viewed as a contributing factor. Had V been in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery when the malpractice occurred, then this would likely be a valid defense

### *United States v. Main* (1997) (9th CC)

* Facts - D (police officer) failed to move an injured victim who then died from asphyxiation. D convicted of IVM
* Holding - Causation is a matter of fact for the jury, including judgment about morality and culpability related to medical treatment errors. It was inappropriate for trial judge to refuse instructing jury about proximate cause.

### *People v Campbell* (Mich. 1983)

* Facts: V sleeps with D's wife (Borat voice) D encourages V to kill himself and provides him with a gun. V kills himself. Is D responsible for his death?
  * Prosecution argues that inciting suicide along with the overt act of furnishing a gun to an intoxicate and emotionally precarious individual is homicide
* Holding: **Court doesn’t hold D responsible for simply furnishing means of suicide**. V had enough free will to decide whether to kill himself. D's hope that V would kill himself is not alone the degree of intention requisite for a finding of murder

### *People v. Kevorkian* (Mich. 1994)

* Facts: D creates assisted suicide machines that victims activate themselves. D is subsequently indicted for murder
  * Issue: Is D responsible as cause of death so as to support finding of murder?
* Holding - Yes. While the victims freely chose to kill themselves, the court distinguishes from *Campbell* stating that a person who actively participates in the commission of a suicide is responsible
  * Court reasons that this is consistent with overwhelming modern trend where **murder conviction is proper if D participates in the final overt act that causes death, but not where merely involved in events leading up to the commission of the final overt act**
    * Example: Murder if help firing a gun or pushing hypodermic needle, but not when simply furnishing the means

* Subsequent Victim Behavior Scenarios
  * Garcia: D is charged with murder for raping Garcia, as prosecution argues that V's subsequent suicide was the result of her loss of the will to live. Is this sufficient to uphold a murder conviction? Does this square with Campbell and Kevorkian? Commentators have expressed skepticism about the level of causation here
  * Blaue: D stabbed victim, but victim refused medical treatment for religious reasons and died. Can D be found guilty for having caused the death of another when her religiously motivated decision contributed to her death? Were D's actions an independent but-for cause?

### *Commonwealth v. Root* (Pa. 1961)

* Facts: Drag racing on a highway, V attempts to pass D and gets in a fatal crash. D charged with murder for causing his death by assenting to the conditions (i.e. drag race) that led to his death
* Holding: Court rejects the charge. V was a rationale, free actor who decided to engage in the dangerous activity. This cuts off of liability, as D's conduct was not a sufficiently direct cause. To hold D to the same civil liability standard of proximate causation, which are dependent on accidental circumstances, would be unjust
  * When proximate cause was first adopted in criminal proceedings, it had a much more different connotation (related to directness) than it does in the modern liberal definition
* Dissent: Contends that conviction should be upheld because D was both the but-for cause (accepted challenge) and proximate cause (crash foreseeable in race)

### *Commonwealth v. Atencio* (MA. 1963)

* Facts - D’s and a friend played Russian roulette. Friend dies during game. D’s convicted of manslaughter, but D’s argued not sufficient cause of friend’s death
* Holding - D’s encouraging victim to engage in reckless activity may provide sufficient cause for victim’s death. Court upholds the conviction while following the MPC. The case can be distinguished from *Root* in that drag ricing required a degree of skill and independent action – Russian roulette is much more about luck. Much more foreseeable that the this could happen such that the complicit boys are responsible
