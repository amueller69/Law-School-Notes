# Homicide

* General Principles

* Two questions that apply to any category of crime:
  1. Criminality - What distinguishes criminal from non-criminal conduct?
  1. Grading - What factors greater or lesser punishment when behavior qualifies a criminal?
* Little doubt about the criminality of homicidal conduct. Instead, the central concern is to determine how much punishment can be imposed (i.e. grading)
  * Happens legislatively by dividing conduct into different names (e.g. murder v. manslaughter) and different degrees
  * Varies by state, which have different statutory schemes and classifications (e.g. PA is different than CA)

## Murder

### Premeditation

* 29 states and Federal system currently use criterion of "premeditation" to identify the most serious categories of murders
  * A majority of those states use *Carroll* approach where this element can be established instantaneously
  * Other states like Arizona use *Guthrie* standard and require murder be preceded length of time which permits reflection
* Types of evidence to establish premeditation as delineated in *Anderson*. Court stated that first degree murders typically involve evidence of all three and at a minimum requires strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with (1) or (3)
  1. Planning – Evidence that shows the D planned to take a life before the act will sufficiently prove premeditation and deliberateness
  1. Motive – Facts about the defendant’s prior relationship with the victim might indicate a reason to kill
  1. Manner of the Killing – Evidence that the manner of the killing was so particular and exacting that the D must have intentionally killed according to preconceived design
* Limitations and issues with premeditation as distinguishing feature of most culpable offenses
  * *Anderson* case in which an extremely gruesome child murder was committed in an enraged and violent outburst (i.e. without premeditation) is intuitively more culpable that dispassionate planned killing
  * Mercy killings would also likely fall into category of most serious killings under this standard
  * As a response, MPC along with some states have rejected premeditation as basis for identifying most serious murders
* *Commonwealth v Carroll* (Pa. 1963)
  * Facts: Appeal of a felony murder conviction in the first degree, the argument is that murder was a crime a passion – not enough premeditation here. 1st degree murder, arguing it’s 3rd degree. D argues that his mental disorders, as well as the previous context of the relationship, got him to the point where he didn’t think – he just acted instinctively
  * Issue: How much premeditation is required for 1st degree murder? What evidence is needed to show that element of premeditation was or was not present?
  * Rule: Premeditation can happen in an instant. Whether the intention to kill arose within a brief time before the act is immaterial. It wasn’t planned in the typical way we might think of premeditation, but it can be instantaneous
  * Notes:
    * Court appears to be suggesting that an act that is deliberate is necessarily premeditated. However, premeditation refers quantity of time required to deliberate (the quality of that thinking ahead). Court suggests that the quantity of time can be close to instantaneous before a crime is committed if attendant circumstances indication deliberation
    * “The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a defendant’s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances together with all reasonable inference therefrom”… it can happen in an instant"
    * “Society would be almost completely unprotected from criminals if the law permitted a bling or irresistible impulse or inability control one’s self to excuse or justify a murder or to reduce it from first degree to second degree”
* *State v Guthrie* (W. Va. 1995)
  * Facts: At issue is a jury instruction for first degree murder and whether the instruction that “it is not necessary that the intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time prior to the actual killing” was a correct interpretation of premeditation
  * Rule: In conflict with *Carrol*, premeditation can’t be instantaneous or near instantaneous. Otherwise, if the State prove premeditation by only showing that intention came into existence for the first time at the time of killing, then it effectively eliminates the distinction between the degrees. Thus, there must be some evidence that D considered and weighed his decision to kill in order to establish premeditation
  * Notes:
    * Court emphasizes the requirement for a period between formation of intent and the actual act in order to establish premeditation. Need an opportunity to reflect and contemplate the act to kill
      * Several arguments for this requirement: Makes act more culpable, harder to deter, and smaller likelihood of getting caught. Each of these arguably make crime more serious and justifying a different grade


## Manslaughter

### Provocation

* Approaches to provocation as a mitigating factor
  * Predominate common-law position that there are specific circumstances that can serve as adequate provocation and mitigate from first degree murder downward. But Mather holds that provoking circumstances need not conform to any pre-established categories. It’s a jury questions
  * If you take the Giroard approach, it seems hard to argue that words can’t provoke people sufficiently, after all people can say truly horrible things. But then again, it might be the case that there’s a concern this doctrine might be abused…
    * Gives people a potential excuse to kill because someone bad mouths them
* *Girouard v. State* (Md. 1991)
  * Facts: D kills W after being thrown into a mad frenzy based on her means words during an argument. D was convicted of second-degree murder, but argues that it should be mitigated to manslaughter despite not falling out of the enumerated categories because it lacks the malice essential for a murder conviction
  * Issue: Should the circumstances mitigate murder to manslaughter? Most states only allow mitigation for provoking circumstances like assault, mutual combat, injury/abuse of a close relative, sudden discovery of adultery
  * Rule: Provocation, to be adequate, must be calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the movement form passion rather than reasons. Mere words are not alone enough to provoke and therefore mitigate, must be paired with conduct indicating intention to commit harm
  * Notes:
    * Court takes a categorically strict approach, there’s a dividing line between conduct and words
    * Court says that other jurisdictions overwhelmingly agree with holding that words are not provocation
    * Standard is one of reasonableness, should not focus on peculiar frailties of D
* *Mather v People* (1862) – Mitigation to Manslaughter / Broad View
  * Facts: Old case. Does hearing of a spouse’s infidelity mitigate the passionate rage that could result leading to homicide? How far does it mitigate?
  * Rule: Hearing of spousal infidelity is a reasonable reason to mitigate. Prefers to kick whether something can mitigate to a jury rather than make it a determination of law. Determining sufficiency of provocation should assume the disposition of a reasonable person of ordinary temperment

### MPC Approach to Mitigation

* In order to mitigate from homicide to manslaughter under the MPC, you therefore need two things:
  1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance
  1. There is a Reasonable Explanation as to Why the Defendant Acted As He Did
* Altogether, around 20 states employ some version of the EED test
  * States vary in the formulation of this test, with some still requiring act of provocation
  * Empirical evidence suggest these defenses are rarely successful under strict adoptions of the MPC approach
* Given that the MPC lays out a subjective and objective element of the doctrine, the question is how and to what degree should we condition on the individual characteristics of the defendant?
  * First Ask – Is a Person in a State of Extreme Emotional Disturbance?
    * Purely subjective, a jury can consider all the personal characteristics that might predispose them to such a state. The jury will have to consider whether they believe the psychiatrist or expert with regard to their state
  * Then Ask – It is reasonable for that person to be in an extreme emotional disturbance state?
    * Mixed subjective, mixed objective test
      1. Immutable factors (like disability, mental deficiency) COUNT, they help define the person’s mind and degree of reasonableness
      1. Social factors (like religion, homophobia) DO NOT COUNT, having a particular emotional belief does not make an action sufficient
    * The question becomes:
      1. What is something looks like an immutable OR social factor
* Limitations
  * Does not recognize moral, ethnic or political beliefs as part of "actor's situation"
  * How do both CL and MPC approaches deal with cultural norms, trauma, mental disorder, age/sex based factors, etc? (pg 486-88)
* *People v. Casassa* (N.Y. 1980)
  * Facts: Victim’s rejection of D cause him prolonged emotional distress (i.e. intense heartbreak) leading him to murder the victim. D argues that at time of offense, he was under influence of extreme emotional disturbance which should mitigate the charge
  * Rule: New York adopts the MPC on this issue and the two part test for mitigation. The court decides that:
    1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance = Subjective Test. Involves a determination that the particular D did in fact act under extreme emotional disturbance
    1. Reasonable Explanation = Objective Test. Must be a "reasonable" explanation for the actor's disturbance based on the external circumstances as the actor understood them at the time
  * Notes:
    * Court says the purpose of this defense is to show actions were caused by mental infirmity, though less serious than that of insanity, making them less culpable for having committed the offense
    * D argues that given his unique mental state and unusual sensitivity to being rejected, you’ve got to use a subjective test to determine emotional disturbance. And there’s some strength to this position, the MPC says it’s about the “viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances he believes them to be”
    * The court argues that there’s got to be an objective portion to the emotional disturbance aspect. In this regard, court found that the unusual sensitivity was so peculiar to D that it is unworthy of mitigation under this standard of reasonableness

## Unintentional Killings

### Creating Homicidal Risk - Criminal vs. Civil Liability

* Facts: Nightclub fire killing people. Question is whether the proprietor, who wasn’t even present or in management at the time of the fire, engaged in conduct that was wanton or reckless and thus committed involuntary manslaughter. Though conduct did not consist of any affirmative act, could it still constitute as reckless vs merely negligent?
* Rule: Reckless can be distinguished from negligence in terms of wilfulness. While result is not intended, the conduct causing such harm must have been intended in light of some awareness of the grave dangers it posed to other (i.e. run the risk). However, if actor is so heedless that he did not realize the grave dangers posed by his conduct, then he cannot escape imputation of recklessness if a reasonable man would have realized this danger.
* Notes
  * Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable consequences to others
  * These terms express a difference in the degree of risk in the voluntary undertaking

## Distinguishing Murder from Manslaughter

### Recklessness as a Substitute for Malice

* Definitions of Unintended Killings as Murder
  * Common law formulations for which unintentional killings constituted murder have been incorporated into statutes or by reference to terms like malice (See *Malone*), which rely on epithets such as "the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart"
  * Many other state statutes use formulations inspired by the MPC approach, in which unintended killings are murder when committed recklessly and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. This omits the common-law language of how wicked or depraved the killing is
* *Commonweatlth v. Malone* (Pa. 1946)
  * Facts: Person dies playing Russian Roulette. The man organizing the game thought it was completely safe – he put one bullet in the chamber and in way that would not go off until five shots. But it happened anyway
  * Rule: Common law's grand criterion for distinguishing murder from other killing was malice on the part of the killer. Malice defined as "any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked...heart". Court holds that when an individual commits acts of gross recklessness which they must reasonably anticipate the death of another is likely, they exhibit this disposition of wickedness. A specific motive isn't always necessary. This case clearly shows a high level of recklessness for which malice is evidenced
* *United States v. Fleming*
  * Facts: Heavily drunk driving D swerving into oncoming traffic to avoid congestion and strikes/kills driver of another vehicle
  * Rule: Malice is distinguishing feature distinguishing murder from manslaughter. To sustain murder conviction, must simply prove that D intended to operate car with a heart that was without regard for life and safety of others. Difference between malice and gross negligence is one of degree. Facts of this case show deviation from ordinary standards of regard for human life/safety than that of ordinary vehicular homicides. Thus, murder conviction sustained

## Felony Murder

### Basic Doctrine

* Classic formulation of the felony-murder doctrine
  * Declares that one is guilty of murder if a death results from conduct during the commission or attempted commission of any felony.” Effectively a strict liability approach where intention to kill or foreseeability is not relevant (at least in the U.S.)
  * Many current murder statutes provide that death that results from the commission of specifically listed felony – such as arson, rape, robbery, or burglary – constitutes first-degree murder for which the maximum penalty is death or life imprisonment
    * If a death results from the commission of an unspecified felony, it is a second degree murder
  * The rule is heavily criticized and even banned in many continental countries
* Doing Away with Mens Rea Requirement?
  * The felony-murder rule seems to facially apply as to whether a felon kills the victim whether or not it’s done so intentionally, recklessly, negligently, or accidentally, and unforeseeably. Does this mean felony-murder creates a strict liability rule?
    * In a sense it does, some courts candidly suggest that felony-murder rule dispenses with the requirement of malice. But the more common rationale is that the intent to commit the felony – itself a frequently life threatening act – constitutes the implied malice required for common law murder
    * Examples:
      * D1 is robber is guilty of murder if V1 dies from fright caused by robbery
      * D2 is guilty of murder if she accidentally shoots V2 in the chest during commission of a felony, and V2 dies years later from a heart attack during a baseball game (causation not entirely clear though)
      * D3 is guilty of murder if she attempts to steal V3’s watch from V3’s purse and a gun concealed in it discharges, killing V3.
    *Implicitly (and often explicitly by statute) the felony murder rule applies to accomplices in the commission of felonies.
* Does not do away with actus reus requirement - causation requirement
  * Must be shown that D's conduct caused a person's death
  * Common formulation contains both "but for" and proximate (natural and ordinary result) causation requirements
  * Foreseeability still factors into the proximate cause prong
* *Reginia v Serne* (England 1887) – Felony Murder Narrow Rule
  * Facts: Old case in which a man allegedly sets fire to his house to collect insurance money and accidently kills his son
  * Rule: The court approaches the rule narrowly. “I think that that, instead of saying that any act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to murder, it would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death should be murder”
* *People v. Stamp* (Cal. 1969) - Broader felony-murder doctrine
  * Facts: In the process of D robbing a store, one of the clerks dies of a heart attack due to the stress of the situation. The man was 60 years old, obese, and had a history of heart disease. The question is whether the man’s death was too attenuated to sustain a conviction given his background
  * Rule: Doctrine is not limited to instances where deaths are foreseeable. Ds are held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or accomplices in the course of a felony as long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the felony and regardless if it were the natural or ordinary result of it
  * Notes: Extends much further than formulation in *Regina*, which still requires some culpability with respect to the killing (i.e. doctrine does not purely accidental killings)

### Modified PA Statute

* §2502 - Criminal Homicide
  * Person is guilty if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of another human being
  * Shall be classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter
* §2502 - Murder  
  * Murder of the first degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing
  * Murder of the second degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony. The felony’s that count:
    * The act of the defendant in engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.
  * Murder of the third degree - All other kinds of murder shall be murder of the third degree. Murder of the third degree is a felony of the first degree
* §2503 - Voluntary manslaughter
  * A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or that he intended to kill
    * Unreasonable Belief Killing Justifiable: A person who intentionally or knowingly kills an individual commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify the killing under Chapter 5 of this title (relating to general principles of justification), but his belief is unreasonable.
* §2504 - Involuntary Manslaughter
  * A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.
