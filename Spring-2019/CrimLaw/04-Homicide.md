# Homicide

* General Principles

* Two questions that apply to any category of crime:
  1. Criminality - What distinguishes criminal from non-criminal conduct?
  1. Grading - What factors greater or lesser punishment when behavior qualifies a criminal?
* Little doubt about the criminality of homicidal conduct. Instead, the central concern is to determine how much punishment can be imposed (i.e. grading)
  * Happens legislatively by dividing conduct into different names (e.g. murder v. manslaughter) and different degrees
  * Varies by state, which have different statutory schemes and classifications (e.g. PA is different than CA)

## Elements and State Legislative Grading

### Modified PA Statute

* **§2502 - Criminal Homicide**
  * Person is guilty if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of another human being
  * Shall be classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter
* **§2502 - Murder**
  * Murder of the first degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing
  * Murder of the second degree - A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony. The felony’s that count:
    * The act of the defendant in engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.
  * Murder of the third degree - All other kinds of murder shall be murder of the third degree. Murder of the third degree is a felony of the first degree
* **§2503 - Voluntary manslaughter**
  * A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or that he intended to kill
    * Unreasonable Belief Killing Justifiable: A person who intentionally or knowingly kills an individual commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify the killing under Chapter 5 of this title (relating to general principles of justification), but his belief is unreasonable.
* **§2504 - Involuntary Manslaughter**
  * A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.

## Intended Killings

### Criteria of Most Serious Killings (i.e. First-Degree)

* 29 states and Federal system currently use criterion of "premeditation" to identify the most serious categories of murders
  * A majority of those states use *Carroll* approach where this element can be established instantaneously
  * Other states like Arizona use *Guthrie* standard and require murder be preceded length of time which permits reflection
* Types of evidence to establish premeditation as delineated in *Anderson*. Court stated that first degree murders typically involve evidence of all three and at a minimum requires strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with (1) or (3)
  1. Planning – Evidence that shows the D planned to take a life before the act will sufficiently prove premeditation and deliberateness
  1. Motive – Facts about the defendant’s prior relationship with the victim might indicate a reason to kill
  1. Manner of the Killing – Evidence that the manner of the killing was so particular and exacting that the D must have intentionally killed according to preconceived design
* Limitations and issues with premeditation as distinguishing feature of most culpable offenses
  * *Anderson* case in which an extremely gruesome child murder was committed in an enraged and violent outburst (i.e. without premeditation) is intuitively more culpable that dispassionate planned killing
  * Mercy killings would also likely fall into category of most serious killings under this standard
  * As a response, MPC along with some states have rejected premeditation as basis for identifying most serious murders

* *Commonwealth v Carroll* (Pa. 1963) - Instantaneous Premeditation
  * Facts: Appeal of a felony murder conviction in the first degree, the argument is that murder was a crime a passion – not enough premeditation here. 1st degree murder, arguing it’s 3rd degree. D argues that his mental disorders, as well as the previous context of the relationship, got him to the point where he didn’t think – he just acted instinctively
  * Issue: How much premeditation is required for 1st degree murder? What evidence is needed to show that element of premeditation was or was not present?
  * Rule: **Premeditation can happen in an instant. Whether the intention to kill arose within a brief time before the act is immaterial**. It wasn’t planned in the typical way we might think of premeditation, but it can be instantaneous
  * Notes:
    * Court appears to be suggesting that an act that is deliberate is necessarily premeditated. However, premeditation refers quantity of time required to deliberate (the quality of that thinking ahead). Court suggests that the quantity of time can be close to instantaneous before a crime is committed if attendant circumstances indication deliberation
    * “The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a defendant’s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances together with all reasonable inference therefrom”… it can happen in an instant"
    * “Society would be almost completely unprotected from criminals if the law permitted a bling or irresistible impulse or inability control one’s self to excuse or justify a murder or to reduce it from first degree to second degree”
  
* *State v Guthrie* (W. Va. 1995) - Period of Reflection
  * Facts: At issue is a jury instruction for first degree murder and whether the instruction that “it is not necessary that the intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time prior to the actual killing” was a correct interpretation of premeditation
  * Rule: In conflict with *Carrol*, **premeditation can’t be instantaneous or near instantaneous**. Otherwise, if the State prove premeditation by only showing that intention came into existence for the first time at the time of killing, then it effectively eliminates the distinction between the degrees. Thus, there must be some evidence that D considered and weighed his decision to kill in order to establish premeditation
  * Notes:
    * Court emphasizes the requirement for a period between formation of intent and the actual act in order to establish premeditation. Need an opportunity to reflect and contemplate the act to kill
      * Several arguments for this requirement: Makes act more culpable, harder to deter, and smaller likelihood of getting caught. Each of these arguably make crime more serious and justifying a different grade

### Mitigation of Intentional Killings (i.e. Manslaughter)

* Approaches to provocation as a mitigating factor
  * Predominate common law position that there are only a few specific circumstances that can serve as adequate provocation and mitigate from first degree murder downward. If you take the *Giroard* approach, it seems counter-intuitive that words alone can’t provoke people sufficiently, after all people can say truly horrible things. However, it might be the case that there’s a concern this doctrine might be abused and present a pretext for people to justify killings
  * *Mather* holds that provoking circumstances need not conform to any pre-established categories - it’s a jury question based on the facts. While this remains minority view, a number of American jurisdictions follow it
  
* Excuses, Justifications, and Cooling Off Period as Basis for Provocation Defense
  * Justification
    * Focuses on the wrongfulness of the act in light of the circumstances. Actor is treated as fully responsible agent, but what the actor did is treated as, at a minimum, not entirely wrong
    * Classic example is something like self-defense; I’m protecting my child, I was justified in killing after I found out the abuse has been happening. Wanted to prevent further abuse
    * Not a full defense, but certainly a partial one that mitigates
    * "Implicit claim in partial justification is that it is to some extent morally justified to make punitive return against someone who causes actor serious offence"
  * Excuse
    * Excuse focuses on the culpability of the actor. When we say an actor is excused, we condemn the act but forgive him merely because of his reduced capacity
    * Classic example is the heat of the moment. Anybody would kill immediately if it happened to them. The act was bad, but D wasn’t in full control – he was killing out of understandable fury that is excused
    * "Provocation must be estimated by the probability that the circumstances would affect most men in like fashion...the greater the provocation measured that way, the more ground there is for attributing the intensity of the actor's passions and lack of self-control...to the extraordinary character in the situation he was placed in."
  * Cooling Off Period - Often courts are forced in these mitigation contexts to determining if there was so-called cooling off. If D kills right when he is provoked, that’s one thing. But if D had time to cool off and recollect himself, then provocation can’t properly mitigate. But how much cooling off time disqualifies?
    * If you view provocation as a partial justification, you look at the conduct of the victim, not the killer. Cooling off doesn’t matter, the victim child abuser did something wrong
    * If you view provocation as an excuse, then cooling off period matters. Acting in the heat of the moment counts as excuse only if it’s in the heat of the moment
  
* *Girouard v. State* (Md. 1991) - Strict, categorical approach
  * Facts: D kills W after being thrown into a mad frenzy based on her means words during an argument. D was convicted of second-degree murder, but argues that it should be mitigated to manslaughter despite not falling out of the enumerated categories because it lacks the malice essential for a murder conviction
  * Issue: Should the circumstances mitigate murder to manslaughter? Most states only allow mitigation for provoking circumstances like assault, mutual combat, injury/abuse of a close relative, sudden discovery of adultery
  * Rule: Provocation, to be adequate, must be calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the movement form passion rather than reasons. **Mere words are not alone enough to provoke and therefore mitigate, must be paired with conduct indicating intention to commit harm**
  * Notes:
    * Court takes a categorically strict approach, there’s a dividing line between conduct and words
    * Court says that other jurisdictions overwhelmingly agree with holding that words are not provocation
    * Standard is one of reasonableness, should not focus on peculiar frailties of D
  
* *Mather v People* (1862) – Broad view
  * Facts: Old case. Does hearing of a spouse’s infidelity mitigate the passionate rage that could result leading to homicide? How far does it mitigate?
  * Rule: Hearing of spousal infidelity is a reasonable reason to mitigate. Prefers to kick whether something can mitigate to a jury rather than make it a determination of law. Determining sufficiency of provocation should assume the disposition of a reasonable person of ordinary temperment

### MPC Approach to Mitigation of Intentional Killings

* In order to mitigate from homicide to manslaughter under the MPC, you therefore need two things:
  1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance
  1. There is a Reasonable Explanation as to why the defendant acted as he did

* Altogether, around 20 states employ some version of the EED test
  * States vary in the formulation of this test, with some still requiring act of provocation
  * Empirical evidence suggest these defenses are rarely successful under strict adoptions of the MPC approach

* Given that the MPC lays out a subjective and objective element of the doctrine, the question is how and to what degree should we condition on the individual characteristics of the defendant?
  * First Ask – Is a Person in a State of Extreme Emotional Disturbance?
    * Purely subjective, a jury can consider all the personal characteristics that might predispose them to such a state. The jury will have to consider whether they believe the psychiatrist or expert with regard to their state
  * Then Ask – It is reasonable for that person to be in an extreme emotional disturbance state?
    * Mixed subjective, mixed objective test
      1. Immutable factors (like disability, mental deficiency) COUNT, they help define the person’s mind and degree of reasonableness
      1. Social factors (like religion, homophobia) DO NOT COUNT, having a particular emotional belief does not make an action sufficient
    * The question becomes:
      1. What is something looks like an immutable OR social factor

* Limitations
  * Does not recognize moral, ethnic or political beliefs as part of "actor's situation"
  * How do both CL and MPC approaches deal with cultural norms, trauma, mental disorder, age/sex based factors, etc? (pg 486-88)

* *People v. Casassa* (N.Y. 1980)
  * Facts: Victim’s rejection of D cause him prolonged emotional distress (i.e. intense heartbreak) leading him to murder the victim. D argues that at time of offense, he was under influence of extreme emotional disturbance which should mitigate the charge
  * Rule: New York adopts the MPC on this issue and the two part test for mitigation. The court decides that:
    1. Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance = Subjective Test. Involves a determination that the particular D did in fact act under extreme emotional disturbance
    1. Reasonable Explanation = Objective Test. Must be a "reasonable" explanation for the actor's disturbance based on the external circumstances as the actor understood them at the time
  * Notes:
    * Court says the purpose of this defense is to show actions were caused by mental infirmity, though less serious than that of insanity, making them less culpable for having committed the offense
    * D argues that given his unique mental state and unusual sensitivity to being rejected, you’ve got to use a subjective test to determine emotional disturbance. And there’s some strength to this position, the MPC says it’s about the “viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances he believes them to be”
    * The court argues that there’s got to be an objective portion to the emotional disturbance aspect. In this regard, court found that the unusual sensitivity was so peculiar to D that it is unworthy of mitigation under this standard of reasonableness

## Unintentional Killings

### Civil vs. Criminal Liability

* *Commonwealth v. Welansky* (Mass. 1944)
  * Facts: Nightclub fire killing people. Question is whether the proprietor, who wasn’t even present or in management at the time of the fire, engaged in conduct that was wanton or reckless and thus committed involuntary manslaughter. Though conduct did not consist of any affirmative act, could it still constitute as reckless vs merely negligent?
  * Rule: **Reckless can be distinguished from negligence in terms of wilfulness. While result is not intended, the conduct causing such harm must have been intended in light of some awareness of the grave dangers it posed to other (i.e. run the risk). However, if actor is so heedless that he did not realize the grave dangers posed by his conduct, then he cannot escape imputation of recklessness if a reasonable man would have realized this danger**
  * Notes
    * Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable consequences to others
    * These terms express a difference in the degree of risk in the voluntary undertaking - substantial departure from behavior of ordinary man
  
* **MPC Approach**
  * Creates two crimes - manslaughter and lesser crime of negligent homicide - which are distinguished by awareness of unwarranted risk
  * Manslaughter if actor was "reckless", meaning he "**consciously** disregarded substantial and unjusifiable risk of conduct causing death to another"
  * Killing is negligent only where he **should** have been aware of such risks

### Distinguishing Murder from Manslaughter

* Definitions of Unintended Killings as Murder
  * Common law formulations for which unintentional killings constituted murder have been incorporated into statutes or by reference to terms like malice (See *Malone*), which rely on epithets such as "the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart"
  * Many other state statutes use formulations inspired by the MPC approach, in which unintended killings are murder when committed recklessly and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. This omits the common-law language of how wicked or depraved the killing is
  
* *Commonweatlth v. Malone* (Pa. 1946)
  * Facts: Person dies playing Russian Roulette. The man organizing the game thought it was completely safe – he put one bullet in the chamber and in way that would not go off until five shots. But it happened anyway
  * Rule: Common law's grand criterion for distinguishing murder from other killing was malice on the part of the killer. Malice defined as "any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked...heart". Court holds that when an individual commits acts of gross recklessness which they must reasonably anticipate the death of another is likely, they exhibit this disposition of wickedness. A specific motive isn't always necessary. This case clearly shows a high level of recklessness for which malice is evidenced
  
* *United States v. Fleming*
  * Facts: Heavily drunk driving D swerving into oncoming traffic to avoid congestion and strikes/kills driver of another vehicle
  * Rule: Malice is distinguishing feature distinguishing murder from manslaughter. To sustain murder conviction, **must simply prove that D intended to operate car with a heart that was without regard for life and safety of others**. Difference between malice and gross negligence is one of degree. Facts of this case show deviation from ordinary standards of regard for human life/safety than that of ordinary vehicular homicides. Thus, murder conviction sustained

---

## Felony Murder

### Basic Doctrine

* Classic formulation of the felony-murder doctrine
  * Declares that one is guilty of murder if a death results from conduct during the commission or attempted commission of any felony.” Effectively a strict liability approach where intention to kill or foreseeability is not relevant (at least in the U.S.)
  * Many current murder statutes provide that death that results from the commission of specifically listed felony – such as arson, rape, robbery, or burglary – constitutes first-degree murder for which the maximum penalty is death or life imprisonment
    * If a death results from the commission of an unspecified felony, it is a second degree murder
  * The rule is heavily criticized and even banned in many continental countries

* *Reginia v Serne* (England 1887) – **Felony Murder Narrow Rule**
  * Facts: Old case in which a man allegedly sets fire to his house to collect insurance money and accidentally kills his son
  * Rule: The court approaches the rule narrowly. “I think that that, instead of saying that any act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to murder, it would be reasonable to say that **any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death should be murder**”
  * Notes:
    * Malice is proven by the commission of the felony itself. However, no clear proof in this case that D actually set fire, so not-guilty verdict
    * Became dominant standard of English common law

* *People v. Stamp* (Cal. 1969) - **Broad Felony Murder Rule**
  * Facts: In the process of D robbing a store, one of the clerks dies of a heart attack due to the stress of the situation. The man was 60 years old, obese, and had a history of heart disease. The question is whether the man’s death was too attenuated to sustain a conviction given his background
  * Rule: Doctrine is not limited to instances where deaths are foreseeable. **Ds are held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or accomplices in the course of a felony as long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the felony and regardless if it were foreseeable or the natural/ordinary result of it**
  * Notes: Extends much further than formulation in *Regina*, which still requires some culpability with respect to the killing (i.e. narrow doctrine does not apply to purely accidental killings)
    * This broad, unqualified felony-murder rule was adopted in the U.S. and is generally accepted in American courts. No proof of mens rea required

### Implications of Felony Murder Doctrine

* Doing Away with Mens Rea Requirement?
  * The felony-murder rule seems to facially apply as to whether a felon kills the victim whether or not it’s done so intentionally, recklessly, negligently, or accidentally, and unforeseeably. Does this mean felony-murder creates a strict liability rule?
    * In a sense it does, some courts candidly suggest that felony-murder rule dispenses with the requirement of malice. But the more common rationale is that the intent to commit the felony – itself a frequently life threatening act – constitutes the implied malice required for common law murder
    * Examples:
      * D1 is robber is guilty of murder if V1 dies from fright caused by robbery
      * D2 is guilty of murder if she accidentally shoots V2 in the chest during commission of a felony, and V2 dies years later from a heart attack during a baseball game (causation not entirely clear though)
      * D3 is guilty of murder if she attempts to steal V3’s watch from V3’s purse and a gun concealed in it discharges, killing V3.
    * Implicitly (and often explicitly by statute) the felony murder rule applies to accomplices in the commission of felonies.
* Does not do away with actus reus requirement - Causation requirement
  * Must be shown that D's conduct caused a person's death
  * Common formulation contains both "but for" and proximate (natural and ordinary result) causation requirements
  * Foreseeability still factors into the proximate cause prong
* Rationale for the Rule - Given criticisms above, consider the following arguments for it:
  * Deterrence: Most common defense of rule is that it intends to deter negligent and accidental killings during the commission of felonies
    * Counterargument: How does one deter an unintended act? The act of committing a felony might be intended, but the result death is unintended
  * Sanctity of Human Life: Some argue that it reaffirms the sanctity of human life, asserting it reflects society’s judgement that the commission of a felony resulting in death is more serious – and therefore deserves greater punishment – than the commission of a felony not resulting in death
    * Counterargument: Even if true, it doesn't follow that a felon who accidentally takes a life should be subject to the severe penalties, including death and life imprisonment, reserved for ordinary murderers. It is unfair to increase a felon’s punishment for the social harm of death that may have been caused unintentionally, non-recklessly, non-negligently
    * Transferred Intent: The argument here is that the felon’s intent to commit a felony is transferred to the homicide via the Transferred Intent Doctrine
      * Counterargument: Misconstrues the transferred intent doctrine. That doctrine provides that an actor’s intention to commit a particular social harm relating to a particular victim may be transferred to a different unintended victim of the SAME social harm. The law does not generally recognize a transference of intent to cause one social harm to a different and greater harm
    * Easing the Prosecutor’s Burden of Proof: Malice Aforethought  can be a tough standard to prove. Argument that felony-murder doctrine is there to ease the prosecutor’s burden of proof but dispensing of the requirement that she show that the felon intended to kill or injure the victim grievously or that the felon was aware that her conduct was highly dangerous
      * Counterargument: Doing away with mens rea can be lead to problematic outcomes

### Inherently Dangerous Felony Limitation

* In response to the above critiques, many states limit the felony murder rule to homicides that occurred during the commission of a felony, with the underlying felony being one dangerous to human life
* Two approaches:
  1. **Abstract Approach** – Courts, though only in a few American jurisdiction, consider the felonies in the abstract. That is, to determine whether a felony is inherently dangerous, a court will ignore the facts of the specific case and, instead, consider the elements of the offense in the abstract. This can demand a lot more by setting a high bar for holding an offense inherently dangerous
     * Example: In the abstract approach, the felony offense of “being a felon in possession of a firearm” is not inherently dangerous, whereas use of a firearm by a former felon is inherently dangerous
     * Example: In on case, false imprisonment was held as not inherently dangerous in the abstract because the elements of fraud and deceit do not involve endangering conduct
  2. **Facts of the Case Approach** – Most jurisdictions employ approach that allows a felony to qualify if it is committed in a dangerous way. Thus, it considers the felony as committed in order to make a determination of the danger posed. "[I]f the felonious conduct, under all of the circumstances, made death a foreseeable consequence."
     * Argues that the abstract approach undermines one of the primary purposes of the modern felony murder rule, namely "to deter dangerous conduct by punishing as murder a homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in perpetuation of a felony."
* What is the problem with the inherently dangerous felony rule?
  * The concerns is that the limitation brings felony murder close to the depraved-heart or extreme-recklessness concept of malice. A felony the commission of which is likely to result in death is a crime the commission of which is apt to demonstrate overlap with the mens rea of recklessness/negligence
  * Now, it is theoretically possible to not consciously take a risk as the reckless standard demands and fall under felony murder, but this seems few and far between

* *People v Phillips* (Cal. 1966) - Abstract approach
  * A doctor was convicted of second degree murder for advising homeopathic remedy to a cancer rather than treatment which led to a little girl’s death. He (falsely) represented he could cure her and took money for this treatment. The court reversed because this theft by deception wasn’t inherently dangerous to life. **It held that only those felonies which are (abstractly) inherently dangerous to human life can support a felony murder charge**

* *Hines v. State* (Ga. 2003) - Circumstantial approach
  * Man accidentally shot a friend dead during a hunting accident and was charged with second degree murder because he had committed a felony possession of a firearm as a former convict. **Court rules that a felony is inherently dangerous when it is dangerous "per se" or "by its circumstances create a foreseeable risk of death"**. Court upheld conviction because the charge of illegal felony possession of a firearm was sufficiently dangerous, as it created foreseeable risk of death

### Merger Doctrine Limitation

* A felony murder only applies if the predicate (underlying) felony is independent of, or collateral to, the homicide. If the felony is not independent, then the felony is said to merge with the homicide and thus felony-murder would be inappropriate (unless the independent felony is of the type that can sustain felony murder conviction)
* **Two tests are commonly used 1) whether the felony is "included in fact" in the homicide or 2) whether the felony is independent of homicide (independent purpose test)**
  * Independent purpose rule prevents truly independent felonies from collapsing into the killing itself, allowing D to circumvent felony-murder instructions
* Rationale:
  * The great majority of states acknowledge some need of merger doctrine in order to ensure that felony-murder does not obliterate grading distinctions the legislature seems to have desired
    * Effect of failing to merge would mean that all intentional killings accomplished by means of a deadly weapon could NEVER be mitigated to manslaughter, as killing was committed in commission of felonious assault
* Many grade homicides by stating that if a death occurs during commission of a specifically listed felony, then the death constitutes first-degree felony- murder, whereas a death resulting during the commission of any other felony – not specifically enumerated – constitutes second-degree felony murder
  * For example, aggravated child abuse is specifically listed in Florida’s first degree felony murder statute. Therefore, although the abuse involves assaultive conduct, the merger rule does not apply to this offense in Florida.

* *People v Burton* (Cal. 1971) – Merger Doctrine Independent Purpose
  * Facts: Armed robbery that leads to a conviction for first degree murder. Argument is that it has to be reduced to a second degree murder because the underlying felonious conduct was an armed assault that went bad, not the type of malice available under 1st Degree. Essentially the prosecutor argues that the purpose of robbery is theft, not assault. And therefore they merge
  * Rule: The court agrees, the two crimes don’t merge into one and D can be charged with robbery and with felony-murder. **Deaths resulting from felonies undertaken for a purpose independent of the homicide support a charge of felony murder**. The purpose of the felony murder is to deter felons from killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible for killings they commit in execution of an underlying, independent felony. Allowing robbery charge to merge would allow D to escape legislatively intended grading
  * Cases Distinguished:
    * *Wilson* - Underlying felony supporting felony murder instruction was burglary with intent to assault. Court in this case held because the object of burglary was assault with a deadly weapon, there was no independent felonious purpose thus the underlying felony merges with the killing and prosecution must show malice/deliberation associated with 1st degree murder. However, in *Burton* object of robbery is not assault, but to obtain money/valuables. Thus, there is an independent purpose and felony murder instruction appropriate

* *People v Robertson* (Notes): V tries to steal D’s hubcaps, D shoots attempting to scare him, but accidentally kills him. Can there be felony murder?
  * Ironically arguing defense that killing wasn't intentional, only intended to scare, D establishes there was an independent purpose and avoids merger, opening himself to felony murder. Dissenting judges here recognize that this is clearly a problem as more culpable actors have better legal standing under this doctrine

* *People v. Chun* - Similar facts as *Robertson* where killings were committed with intent to scare. Court overturns *Robertson*, holding that wherever the offense is assaultive in nature (involves immediate threat of injury), it merges with killing and is not basis for felony murder instruction. However, the recklessness in this case was so clear as to establish elements required for traditional murder

### Killing Not in Furtherance of the Felony

* Felony murder rule can only apply when the act of killing is done **in furtherance** of the underlying felony. This is usually clear, but not always. Two types of situations where questions arise:
  1. Lethal acts committed *after* the felony and are arguably unrelated
  1. Lethal acts committed in resistance to the felony
* Two approaches to the latter category - acts committed by non-felons in resistance to underlying crime
  * **The “Proximate Cause” Approach** - A felon is liable for any death that is proximate result of the felony, even if the shooter is not one of the felons. This is a very fact specific approach, it depends on the circumstances
    * Rationale: When a felon’s attempt to commit a foreseeable felony sets in motion a chain of events which were or should have been within his contemplation when the motion was initiated, he should be held responsible for any death which by direct and inevitable sequence is a result”
      * F1 and F2 hold up a liquor store. F1 fires at X to scare him and X fires back, killing F1 and accidentally killing V. F2 is likely guilty of felony murder under this approach
  * **The “Agency” Approach** - A majority of states take this approach, which provides that the felony does not extend to a killing, although growing out of the commission of the felony, if directly attributable to the act of one other than the defendant or those associated with him in the unlawful enterprise
    * **In other words, the felony-murder rule does not apply if an adversary to the crime, rather than the felon, personally commits the homicidal act**
    * Rationale: A person should not be responsible for the actions of others not associated with the conspiracy. A felon who does not shoot anyone (F2) is not responsible for the actions a non-shooter (X)
    * However, if X was the accomplice of F1 and F2, then F2 could get felony murder for F1 and V
  
* *People v Gillis*: Man is robbing house, is caught, and fleas. 15 minutes later, as the man is fleeing, a trooper spots the car and begins pursuit. In pursuit the man hits another car, killing two people
  * Felony Murder? Yes. **If necessary to complete the commission of a crime, then it is "in furtherance" of the felony**
    * Still raises questions - suppose D had lost the police and stopped to grab something to eat before resuming his drive?
  
* *People v Cabatero*: A gang is committing robbery. A lookout panics at an approaching car and shoots at it. Angered by the lookouts stupidity, the gang leader shoots the lookout. The gang leader can be charged with murder, but the other robbers?
  * Felony Murder? Yes, **because this act was a part of protecting the underlying illegal operation in which the other members were involved in**. If the victim had killed a police officer approaching, then felony murder would apply because it was in furtherance of the crime (i.e. prevent getting caught)
    * But if a felon does something not related to the furthering the crime, then felony murder doesn’t apply to others
    * Note: This also relies on accomplice liability, which is another issue altogether
  
* *State v. Canola* (N.J. 1977)
  * Facts - D and others robbed a jewelry store, and one of D’s co-felons and the store owner killed by another of D’s co-felons. D convicted of first-degree murder under FMR, but D argued “agency” theory precluded felony-murder rule
  * Holding - Felony murder rule does not apply to the death of a co-felon under agency approach

## Death Penalty

### Issues, Developments, and Policy Considerations

* Death Penalty is expensive to administer
  * Significantly greater investigative, trial, and appeal costs
  * In NC, it costs over $2 million per execution more than if it were just to impose life sentence
* MPC has withdrawn death penalty (not officially endorsing or opposing it) b/c of the “current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment”
* Still has public support, though lower than its peak
  * Trending downward
  * Subject to little regional variation, but extent to which penalty is carried out widely differ
* Number of states recently moved away
  * 7 states made it illegal, 21 more have proposed its repeal, others have undertaken reviews of the process
  
* **Primary considerations are related to the animating principles of criminal law and theories of punishment**
  * Deterrence
    * As long as people believe that death penalty is worse than life sentence, it should have a deterrent effect (in theory)
      * Counterargument that it has "brutalization effect" promoting violence to deal with problems and thus increasing murder rate
    * Empirical evidence is inconclusive
      * Raises question of how sure do we need to be of deterrent effect in order to justify using capital punishment?
  * Retribution
    * Kantian defense rests on the principle of equality, the basis for the biblical principle of lex talonis ("an eye for an eye")
      * This is compelled by, and according to Kant is consistent with, the CI
    * Expressive function, though this seems to have an end that falls outside pure retribution
  
* Error and Bias
  * Is risk of error inherently less acceptable in capital sentencing due to the significance of its implications?
    * Can't simply correct it after innocent person has been executed
    * To what extent to improved forensic technologies alleviate this concern? In reality, this probably doesn't make a significant difference as it is rarely available and subject to error itself
    * Counterargument that concerns about protecting the innocent are given too much weight and the risk must be accepted in order to achieve benefits of the death penalty
  * Argument that disproportionate racial or economic bias that is systemic in the administration of capital punishment
    * Consider poor defendants who can't afford adequate legal representation or black defendants subject to discrimination
  
* Constitutional Limitations
  * Procedural Due Process under 5th and 14th Amendments
    * SCOTUS, in *McGautha*, rejects argument that life-or-death sentencing decisions needs to follow some explicit criteria in order to comport with due process. Instead, due process is consistent with leaving these decisions to the unguided discretion of judges and juries
  * 8th Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment
    * SCOTUS ruled shortly after in *Furman* that capital punishment is it was administered then (1972) was a violation of protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Forced states to quickly adopt new legislation clarifying sentencing criteria (either by re-writing laws to (1) make death penalty mandatory for certain crimes OR (2) standardize guidelines for jury sentencing)
  
* Guided discretion and mandatory sentencing
  * New statutory schemes adopted in TX, GA, and FL post *Furman* were upheld. These required sentencing authority weigh certain factors, yet did not impose mandatory imposition of death sentence, ultimately leaving decision to jury
  * Court later held mandatory capital sentencing were inconsistent with standards of decency and thus remained unconstitutional. They argued this schemes fail to address concerns from *Furman* of unchecked and unguided jury, especially when they felt sentence was inappropriate. Individualized sentencing, where all possible mitigating factors are considered, is necessary (*Woodson* and *Locket*)
  * *Woodson* and *Lockett* decisions, where mitigating factors to be considered cannot be limited to those specifically enumerated in the statute, seems to conflict with *Furman* decision arguing the need for structure and less arbitrariness in sentencing guidelines. Also concerns about the excessive time needed for this detailed procedural review and how the time it forces D to spend on death row are irreconcilable with goals of punishment
  
* Limitations
  * Declared unconstitutional under 8th Amendment where disproportional to the offense, such as rape (*Coker*)
  * Capital sentencing for the mentally disabled ruled to be unconstitutional in *Atkins*
    * Criteria for determining when this applies is unclear, as is standard of proof necessary to establish intellecutal disability

|1972|**Furman v. Georgia**|Death sentences in these cases were unconstitutional.

|1976|**Gregg v.
