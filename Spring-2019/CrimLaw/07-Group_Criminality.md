# Group Criminality

* Two bases of complicity fore acts committed by others are to be considered
  1. A person may be held accountable for the conduct of another person if he assists the other in committing an offense. This is called **accessory or accomplice liability**
  1. In the great majority of jurisdictions, a person who has conspired with another may be held accountable for the conduct of his-co conspirator who commits a crime in furtherance of their agreement. In this case, the mere existence of a **conspiracy** is sufficient to justify liability for the other’s conduct; assistance in commission of the crime is not required.

## Accomplice Liability

* Mens Rea of Accomplice Liability
  * The problem of mens rea for complicity is complicated by the presence of two levels of mens rea: (1) that required of the accomplice (the helper or encourager) and that required of the principle (the actual perpetrator). However, the mens rea of the accomplice is distinct
  * A true purpose, often called a **specific intent**, is generally required to hold a person liable as an accomplice; that is, he must actually intend his action to further the criminal action or conduct of the principal”
    * However, most courts agree that this specific intent is only required for the conduct he engages in, whereas the result only requires same mens rea needed to satisfy the substantive offense (i.e. must intend to aid in something reckless, but need not specifically intend to aid in crime of recklessness/negligence)
    * As shown below, this specific intent requirement has been incorporated into the MPC and adopted in state statutes
* MPC Approach - requires actor have "the purpose of promoting or facilitating" the commission of the crime
  * (1) A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or both.
  * (2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:
    * (a) acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; or
    * (b) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by the Code or by the law defining the offense; or
    * (c) he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.
  * (3) A person **is an accomplice** of another person in the commission of an offense if:
    * (a) **with the purpose of promoting or facilitating** the commission of the offense, he
      * (i) **solicits** such other person to commit it, or
      * (ii) **aids or agrees or attempts** to aid such other person in planning or committing it, or
      * (iii) having **a legal duty to prevent** the commission of the offense, **fails to make proper effort so to do**; or
        * Example: Most courts agree that parents can be liable under an aiding and abetting theory for a crime committed by a third party when they fail to protect their children from abuse
    * (b) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity
  * (4) If a specific result is an element of the target crime, D acts with “**the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for commission of the offense**”
        * Example: Where 3rd degree murder is satisfied by gross recklessness, accomplice that aids with same level of recklessness with respect to the result needed can be held legally accountable as an accomplice
  * Recap:
    * Actus reus for acting as an accomplice
      * Aiding or soliciting is enough, omissions can sometimes be if based on legal duty
      * D’s mere presence is not sufficient to establish actus reus
    * Mens rea for accomplice liability
      * D must act with the purpose of promoting/facilitating target crime OR
      * D must act with same level of culpability with respect to result that is sufficient for commission of that offense
* Substantive Crimes of Facilitation
  * Majority in *Rosemond* suggests that if the crime is already in progress when the defendant first becomes aware of the use of a gun, the defendant may not have sufficient notice to be held responsible for it. The Dissent argues that the defendant should be liable as long as he is aware of the gun and persists with the drug deal with that knowledge”
  * One possible way to mitigate in this regard is to just make criminal facilitation a stand-alone crime all the time and make it a lesser penalty than the crime aided
  * Often times, states have created special statutes making aiding and abetting certain crimes spelled out, including: Selling Guns to Juveniles, Material Support to Terrorism, Money Laundering
* Accomplice Liability for Non-Specific Intent Crimes
  * There is a general rule that accomplice liability requires specific intent. But specific intent with respect to which elements. McVay and Roebuck make clear that there is a distinction between conduct elements and result elements. These cases recognize that **for accomplice liability, the accomplice must have specific intent to further the underlying conduct committed by the principle, but for the result, he need only have the mens rea required for the result element of the substantive offense**
* Attempt v Complicity under MPC
  * Result
    * With attempt, MPC requires D have the purpose to produce the proscribed result or the belief that his conduct will cause the result, even when lesser mens rea (e.g. recklessness) would satisfy completed offense. However, for D charged with accomplice liability in an offense, the required mens rea for resulting harm is not purpose, but only the mens rea required for the commission of the charged offense
  * Attendant Circumstances
    * MPC is less demanding with attempt than with complicity when it comes to attendant circumstances. The mens rea for attendant circumstances in cases of attempt is not purpose, but only the mens rea required for the completed crime”. Thus, under MPC, attempted statutory rape can be satisfied without any suspicion that victim was underage
* **Natural and Probable Causes Doctrine**
  * Addresses the question of what happens if a different crime occurs than the one the accomplice intended to help with occurs
  * Holds that if the result is a “natural and probable” consequence in the “ordinary course of things,” then the accomplice can be found liable. In other words, a “person encouraging or facilitating the commission of a crime [may] be held criminally liable not only for that crime, but for any other offense that was a natural or probably consequence of the crime aided and abetted
* Relationship Between Liability of Parties
  * Feigned Principal Approach
    * It is frequently stated that, to be an accomplice, a person “must not only have the purpose that someone else engage in the conduct which constitutes the particular crime charged, but the accomplice musts also share in the same intent which is required for commission of the substantive offense.
    * What happens when a police officer or private person joins a criminal endeavor as an “accomplice” and feigns a criminal intent in order to obtain incriminating evidence against the primary party or ensnare the other in criminal activity
  * Vaden Principal Approach:
    * If there is a crime but there is also a legal barrier to prosecuting the principal (i.e. immunity, self-defense, etc...) the accomplice does not benefit from the unique defense. It does not transfer to the accomplice because the accomplice has his own mens rea and actus reus
    * Notice how this is different from Hayes. In Hayes there was also no underlying crime. However, *Hayes* court held that you can’t be an accomplice to a principal not committing a crime, regardless of mens rea
      * These could be reconciled. In *Hayes*, there was no actus reus in the underlying crime - no actual criminal act took place. However, argument can be made that crime took place in *Vaden*, but qualified immunity was simply an defense/justification which relieved principal of any liability
    * Most modern codes carve this out???
* Acquittal on the Basis of a Defense
  * If the principle is acquitted on a defense, does that transfer to the accomplice? We know that the Vaden Principle doesn’t transfer immunity, but what is the general rule?
    * If the acquittal is a Justification:
      * The defense passes to the accomplice. For example, recognition of self-defense for the principle implies that no crime has occurred, or even that positive good has resulted. In absence of wrongdoing by the principle, like in Hayes, the accomplice can’t be charged
    * If only a partial justification (e.g. unreasonable self-defense)
      * Accomplice can still be liable… see below hypo
    * If the acquittal is an Excuse...
      * When the primary party is acquitted on the basis of an excuse (e.g. insanity) his acquittal should not bar a successful prosecution of a secondary party to whom the excuse does not extend. An acquittal on the ground of an excuse means that the actions of the primary party were wrongful, but that he was not responsible because of a personal excusing condition
  * Innocent Agent Doctrine
    * There is no such thing as accomplice liability if a person forces another person to be the agent or instrument of the crime
    * So if Z comes up to you and forces you to commit a crime or he kills you. If you commit the crime, you obviously have a duress defense
      * The way the law treats this situation is to say: There is NO accomplice liability. Z’s guilt is not derivative from your actions. Rather, it is direct liability situation – your actions transfer to Z because you are simply a forced instrument of criminality

## Accomplice Liability - Cases

### *Hicks v. United States* (1893)

* Facts: Two Native Americans appear to engage in dispute with V. One of the men raises rifle at V several times. Other man (D) overheard yelling at V "take your hat off and die like a man" where upon the other man shot V to death. Two men rode off together. D convicted of encouraging and abetting a murder
* Issue: Was it proper to instruct jury that if deliberate/intentional use of words had effect of encouraging killing of another man proper, we can infer intent and D is responsible?
* Holding:
  * No. This phrase was not enough to infer mens rea. **Use of the words must be intended to encourage the act.** The jury instructions were defective insofar as they assumed intent to encourage could be inferred from the intentional use of certain words (regardless of how he intended to use the words and thus regardless of mens rea)
  * **While it is true that mere presence, but non-participation due to lack of necessity, can be interpreted as aiding in the crime, this only applies in instances such as where there is a previously discussed criminal conspiracy**. No evidence of such conspiracy here. Conviction reversed

### *State v Gladstone* (1970 WA)

* Facts: Defendant Gladstone was approached by an undercover officer looking to nab him for selling marijuana. Gladstone said he could sell any to him at the time, but suggested he go and check out his friend Robert Kent. The undercover officer then went to Kent and bought marijuana. Kent was arrested, but then Gladstone was charged with abetting the sale of marijuana despite the fact there was no evidence of any communication between the parties
* Rule: **In order to aid and abet, D must associate himself in some sort with the venture, participate in it as something he wishes to bring about, and that he seek by action to make it succeed**
* Holding: Court reverses the conviction
  * Vital element - a nexus between the accused and the party he is accused of abetting in the crime--is missing
  * Nothing from which we can infer that had any communication with seller, that he was encouraged/counseled/commanded/hired to refer potential buyers to seller
  * Even without prior agreement/communication, can still be guilty if coming to aid of a robber and knowingly assisting him in committing the crime
    * This is not happening here. Merely described the seller as someone who may possess weed. Had no interest in whether buyer actually obtained it

### *Rosemond v United States* (2014)

* Facts: Rosemond (D) took part, with two others, in an attempted drug deal. The buyer, upon being given them to inspect, grabbed the drugs and ran. Someone in D's party, though unclear who from the evidence, fired shots. Rosemond was charged with aiding and abetting the use of a gun in connection with a drug-trafficking offense. The jury convicted Rosemond. CoA affirmed
* Issue: Was jury properly instructed when told to return guilty verdict if "(1) the defendant knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) the defendant knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking crime.”
* Rule: **Intent requirement is satisfied when person actively participates with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense**
* Holding: Conviction is affirmed
  * Under the common law and MPC, mere knowledge of an offense does not create culpability - must be purpose to aid in the offense
  * But in this case, the SCOTUS says that advance knowledge was enough. Advance knowledge had a weapon that could be used in the commission of drug deal and actively participating in it was enough to impute accomplice liability
    * Example: If friend pulls out a you didn’t know he had, then no liability. However, advance knowledge of the gun would be enough
* Notes
  * Many states have adopted the advanced knowledge standard as qualifying for complicity
  * Does this mean that knowledge is the actual standard after all? Is purpose the same active participation knowing the consequences? Is there a clear line between incidental facilitation and active participation?

### *State v McVay* (1926 RI)

* Facts: The captain and his crew were charged with manslaughter arising from criminal negligence resulting in the explosion of a boiler on a ship, which killed multiple passengers. Ds told steamboat captain to use boat despite knowing the engine was unsafe
* Issue: Is it possible to hold someone as an accessory to a crime when they did something negligent before the fact (i.e. before the actual crime?)
* Rule: It is possible to be an accessory to manslaughter or negligence before the fact
* Holding:
  * **There is no inherent reason why, prior to the commission of such a crime, one may not aid, abet, counsel, command, or procure the doing of the unlawful act or of the lawful act in a negligent manner**
    * The violation of the duty was intentional in the sense that it was a choice among possible courses of action. D is charged with full knowledge of that duty and of the fact that the boiler was unsafe, yet procured captain to act in a grossly negligent manner (i.e. **D knew of the duties yet purposefully got them to ignore it**)
  * “A jury might find that defendant Kelley, with full knowledge of the possible danger to human life, recklessly and willfully advised, counseled, and commanded the captain and engineer to take a chance by negligent action or failure to act”

### **Commonwealth v Roebuck** (2011 PA)

* Facts: D helped helped orchestrate the events, even though he didn't participate in the highly reckless murder. Helped lure the victim to the room. But had no intent that the victim be killed. D convicted as an accomplice to 3rd degree murder
* Defense Argument: “There is no rational legal theory to support accomplice liability. Accomplice liability attaches only where the defendant intends to facilitate or promote an underlying offense; third-degree murder is an unintentional killing committed with malice; therefore, to adjudge a criminal defendant guilty of third degree murder as an accomplice would be to accept that the accused intended to aid an unintentional act, which is a logical impossibility”
* Prosecution Argument: The accomplice liability readily pertains to third degree murder because it is the shared criminal intent motivating the underlying conduct (here, designing a reckless/dangerous alteration) which establishes the requisite criminal liability
* Rule: **As long as there is specific intent in the underlying conduct which lead to the result, intent component (and thus mens rea for AL) is satisfied**
* Holding: Conviction on basis of accomplice liability is upheld
  * The court accepts the prosecution argument, pointing to §2.06(4) of MPC
    * "Indeed, an accomplice to third degree murder does not intend to aid an unintentional murder; he intends to aid a malicious act which results in killing"

### *People v Russel* (1998 NY)

* Facts: Ds got into a shoot-out with each other. One stray bullet killed a victim bystander. Ballistics could not determine who’s gun the stray bullet came from. However, each defendant was charged with second-degree depraved murder under a theory that “each of them ‘intentionally aided’ the defendant of the fatal shot”, regardless of whom was the principal offender and who was merely and accomplice
* Holding - Court upholds the convictions; **multiple defendants can be charged with depraved indifference murder committed by only one defendant if each defendant intentionally aided the defendant who committed the murder**
  * “The prosecution was not required to prove which defendant fired the fatal shot when the evidence was sufficient that each defendant acted with the metal culpability required for the commission of depraved indifference murder, and each defendant intentionally aided the defendant who fired the fatal shot, even if it is impossible to identify that particular defendant”
  * Adequate proof that defendants acknowledged and accepted gunfight challenge prior to the shooting and thus acted with the required mental culpability
* Notes:
  * Causation not really an issue here because one of the Ds was clearly the but-for and proximate cause. The conviction of the other Ds derives not from causing the result, but by acting as accomplices of whoever caused the result

### *People v Luparello* (1987 CA)

* Facts: Defendant sought to get information on his former wife, who had left him for another man. Defendant sought the aid of several friends to try to get info from a good friend of the husband named Martin. The friends ended up killing Martin. Defendant was charged with first degree murder under the natural and probable consequences theory. Luparello argues that the trial court improperly imposed “mens rea” upon him in the killing of Martin, as he did not share the killer's intent
  * One Plurality Opinion – "Jurisdiction requires a holding than aider and abettor or co-conspirer **is liable not only for those crimes committed by a co-felon which he intended or agreed to facilitate but also any additional crimes which are ‘reasonably foreseeable.’**"
  * Another Plurality Opinion – Concurs, but law needs to be changed because it is logically indefensible. We need be concerned about the fact that the contemplated crime was far less serious than the one committed. The lack of regard for this violates a policy in the criminal law not to hold people responsible for things that they did not intend to do an to punish in proportion to one's mental state

### *Wilcox v Jeffrey* 1951 (UK)

* Facts: Hawkins is a celebrated saxophone player. Mr. Curtis and Mr. Hughes, owners of a jazz club in Willesden, invited Hawkins to the United Kingdom to perform a concert. Although Mr. Curtis and Hawkins had applied for permission for Hawkins to land, their petition was refused. Wilcox was present when Hawkins landed at the airport. Despite the law, Hawkins came to the country anyway and a concert was arranged at the Princess Theatre in London. Wilcox purchased a ticket for the show and subsequently, wrote about that show for publication in his magazine.
* Issue: Wilcox never met Hawkins and simply benefited from his presence. Can he be convicted of encouraging the illegal performance of Hawkins simply by writing on that said performance?
* Rule: **Not Much is Required for finding of encouragement. Knowledge of unlawful act of a third-party without intervention in order to serve some personal interest is sufficient**.
* Holding: Wilcox's conduct was sufficient enough encouragement to sustain an accomplice liability. Wilcox knew he was here illegally (thus had the mens rea) and the court ruled the purchase of the ticket (not only the magazine article) was enough for accomplice liability. He was there for the purpose of reporting for his publication. Had he shown some evidence of protest, such as booing, then perhaps his conduct would not be viewed as aiding and abetting
* Notes
  * Begs the Question – This Seems Too Low of a Threshold
    * Could all the audience members be guilty of conspiracy
    * There’s no but-for causation. The encouragement didn’t seem to assist
  * Some offenses, such as dog fighting, hold spectators criminally liable for there mere presence at such events
    * New Bedford rape case saw two people acquitted of involvement in gang rape despite verbal encouragement while crime was on going
  * Speech has been criticized as basis for encouragement
    * Hard to determine true mental state thus difficult to infer what was intended

### *State ex rel. Attorney General v Tally Judge* (1894 AL)

* Facts: V seduces D's sister in law. D's brother in law go out to find and kill him. D goes to telegraph office and prevents message warning V of danger from getting through.
* Rule: Establishes and emphasizes that you don’t need to prove but-for causation. If an act MIGHT have encouraged or assisted, then that’s enough. Low threshold for encouragement.
* Quote: The assistance given, however, need not contribute to the criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. **It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it. It is quite enough if the aid merely renders it easier for the principle actor to accomplish the end intended by him and the aider and abettor, though in all human probability the end would have been attained without it**”
* Notes:
  * >As Tally and Wilcox make clear, it is not necessary to establish a but-for relation between the defendant’s action and the criminal conduct of another to establish accomplice liability. What is the justification for holding someone liable for a crime if it would have occurred anyway?
    * Doesn’t this contradict the Bedford Rape Cases?

### *State v. Hayes* (1891 MO)

* Facts: S proposed to P that P join S in the burglary of V’s store. S was unaware of the fact that P was a relative of V. With V’s approval, P agreed to the plan. S assisted P into the building, and took possession of property handed to him by P. Before they could leave the store, S got arrested for burglary and was convicted.
* Rule: **Where criminal liability derives from principal, regardless of intent, not an aider & abetter if principal doesn't satisfy elements of the underlying criminal act**
* Holding: The Court vacated the charge
  * While S had the full intent, P was the primary party doing the stealing: P committed the acts that arguably constituted the burglary
    * "Where overt acts going to make up the crime charged is personally done by D and with intent, his guilt is complete". However, D did not complete eery overt act. He never stepped foot into the store; he only assisted P. Thus, he did no crime regardless of his intent
  * S’s liability therefore had to derive from P
    * But P was not guilty of burglary because he entered the building with the express approval of the owner, his father, therefore he lacked the specific intent to commit a felony (theft, which requires specific intent to permanently deprive property)
  * So because P was not guilty of crime, S cannot be charged with accomplice liability because it is a derivative offense
    * To make D responsible for acts of P, they must have common motive and design. Clearly they did not
    * But S can probably be charged with attempt

### *Vaden v State* (1989 AK)
  
* Facts: Law enforcement received a tip that Douglas Vaden (defendant) was using illegal hunting methods while providing guiding services to hunters. John Snell, an undercover agent from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, posed as a hunter, asking Vaden to act as a guide. During the hunt, Snell shot and killed four foxes from Vaden’s aircraft using a shotgun provided by Vaden. At the time, fox-hunting season was closed
* Rule: **A justification defense (e.g. qualified immunity) does not transfer from principal to accomplice. The fact that principal is not guilty of underlying crime does not absolve accomplice of aiding and abetting**
* Holding: The majority refused to follow Hayes and upheld the conviction. A justification defense that is available to an undercover agent for the commission of a crime is not transferable to the agent’s accomplice
  * In cases involving accomplice liability, the principal actor does not need to be convicted or even prosecuted in order for the accomplice to be found guilty. Therefore, the accomplice’s intent is the central issue, and the defenses of entrapment and public authority justification, which focus on an undercover agent’s state of mind, may not be transferred to the accomplice.
* Dissent:
  * It is improper for the police to personally engage in criminal conduct for the purpose of securing convictions of accomplices to crimes - "the act of a feigned accomplice may never be imputed to the targeted D for purposes of obtaining a conviction"

Some final, challenging hypos:

* Modern code anticipates defense like the one in *Hayes*
  * Attempt under 5.01 (instead of 2.06)

### Acquittal Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical #1 - Principle is acquitted, but Accomplice is Not
  * Setup: Principle is acquitted. Accomplice argues that as a matter of law, if the principle is not guilty than the accomplice can’t be guilty
  * SCOTUS says that it’s up to jury discretion. It can be tried again, the fact that one jury found the principle not guilty doesn’t mean that the accomplice doesn’t necessarily benefit from the verdict if the prosecution can convince another jury that the principle is guilty AND so to the accomplice
    * There might be a collateral estoppel if this was a civil case. But like with Vaden, you can’t
* Hypothetical #2 - Can the Victim be an Accomplice to His Own Injury?
  * Setup: Principal is charged with statutory rape. Defense is that the victim told me she was 18, but it turned out she was under 16. Principal is clearly liable, since it’s strict liability crime
  * Question: Can the girl be prosecuted that she was an accomplice for telling her that she was 18?
  * Generally the law says a victim cannot be viewed that she’s an accomplice. But why does this matter – the D may not have committed the crime if she didn’t say. Most courts kick this to the legislature – if they want to create an immunity for the victim, then that’s their prerogative
* Hypothetical #3 - Severity of Accomplice's Crime
  * Question: Can the accomplice be found guilty of a crime more serious than the principle?
  * Answer: No
    * Straight forward application of derivative liability. Even if the accomplice has a higher level of mens rea the most they can be punished for is the level of crime the principle commits
* Hypothetical #4 - What if the Principle on has a Partial Justification?
  * Setup: If a principle kills in an unreasonable belief of self-defense (in most states if your killing is unreasonable self- defense, but self-defense nonetheless, you get manslaughter instead of murder)
  * Question: What can an accomplice get in this situation?
  * Answer: The accomplice can get MURDER not MANSLAUGHTER because it’s not a full justification. Impartial Self-Defense mitigation cannot benefit the accomplice. It’s hard to square with the above hypo.

## Conspiracy

* The Actus Reus of Conspiracy
  * Conspiracy is typically defined as an agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime, unlike accomplice liability which is satisfied when accomplice facilitates the crime regardless of prior agreement of such facilitation
  * Actus reus of the offense is the agreement itself. It’s easy to get conspiracy if the agreement is recorded somehow, but rarely does evidence exist that explicitly shows conspiracy. Thus, courts need to infer conspiratorial agreement from circumstances surrounding the commissions and separate acts of the accused co-conspirators
* Overt Act Requirement? Conspiracy = (Agreement) + (Some Overt Act in Furtherance of it)
  * Conduct can be punishable as a conspiracy at points much further back in the stages of preparation than the point where liability begins to attach for attempt
    * Example: 18 U.S.C. §371 - "If one or more persons conspire to commit any offense and one or more such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy"
  * Most statutes across the country require an agreement & some act in furtherance of it. The thought is similar to the requirement for attempt. But for conspiracy, a lot of these statues require a lot less of an overt act than for attempt
    1. Attempt = Requires much more substantial overt act
    1. Conspiracy = Doesn’t require much
  * Example: A and B say “let’s rob a bank” and B goes and Googles local banks. This is usually enough of an overt act. Prosecutions rarely fail on this ground
  * Other states require a more substantial overt act and Maine even requires same standard needed for attempt
* Mens Rea of Conspiracy
  * MPC goes beyond mere knowledge by requiring purpose. Thus, you need to prove two things:
    1. **Knowledge of Illegal Conduct**
    1. **Intent to Facilitate that Illegal conduct**
  * Corrupt Motive - Old common law requirement that has pretty much been rejected in modern law
    * *Powell* Doctrine - Conspiracy must be animated by a "corrupt" motive or an intention to engage in conduct known to be wrongful
  * Attendant circumstances - Mistake of fact
    * Should mistake of fact to some attendant circumstance act as defense to conspiracy if it wouldn't be recognized as defense to underlying crime?
      * *Freed* court considers facts which increase the gravity of the offense in answering this question. Agreement to acquire hand grenade is enough here, even if D was ignorant that grenade was unregistered (this was not an act innocent in itself)
      * Where act is truly innocent, MPC commentaries seems to leave this up to the courts
* Conspiracy as a Form of Accomplice Liability
  * Most jurisdictions follow ***Pinkerton* liability doctrine - Vicarious liability for substantive offenses committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy**
    * Some extend even further to offenses that were reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of the conspiracy, like in *Bridges* and *Alvarez*
  * **Arguments in favor of *Pinkerton* Standard**
    * Counter to Sophistication: “The ever-increasing sophistication of organized crime presents a compelling reason against abandonment of Pinkerton. Complicated and highly refined stock frauds….and narcotics conspiracies represent a substantial and ever-increasing threat to society justifying retention of the Pinkerton doctrine. Empirical evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that those who form and control illegal enterprises are generally well insulated from prosecutions” if not for conspiracy statues
    * Difficult to Apprehend: “Where individual members of conspiracies are difficult to apprehend, conspiracy law makes it possible to inflict costs on them indirectly by punishing other members who are more accessible.” Punish lower level drug dealers to force the more difficult to find high level managers to take on greater risk
    * Get People to Squeal: Get low level criminals to squeal by cutting deals on conspiracy charges
  * **Arguments against *Pinkerton* Standard**
    * Repugnant to Our System: Not offensive to permit conviction of conspiracy to stand on the overt act of another, for the act merely provides corroboration of the existence of an agreement which has reached point where it poses threat to society. However, it is repugnant to our system of jurisprudence, where guilt is generally personal to the defendant…to impose punishment, not for the socially harmful agreement to which the defendant is a party, but for substantive offenses in which he did not participate
    * Violates Individual Criminal Liability: “Violates the principle of individual criminal liability in a context where ‘proof is often notoriously uncertain’ because ‘convictions for conspiracies themselves often rest on dubious evidence”
    * MPC Takes Different Approach: “The MPC also rejects Pinkerton, imposing accomplice liability on conspirators for the substantive crimes of their co-conspirators only when the strict conditions for accomplice liability are met”
  * Contrasting *Pinkerton* with Accomplice Liability in *Luparello*
    * Traditional accomplice liability requires proof of intent to promote/facilitate the action, thus theory in *Pinkerton* (and *Bridges* to an even greater extent) may represent significant expansion of liability
    * However, we saw a similar such expansion of accomplice liability in *Luperello*

### *Perry v State* (2014 FL) – Conspiracy & Parallel Action

* Facts: Perry let known sex offender sleep in same bed with 8 year old daughter. Sex offender molested daughter on numerous occasions. Perry charged with conspiracy and aiding abetting for the sexual assault of her daughter. Accomplice liability was sustained – it was proven Perry helped with the sexual assault (i.e. helped unlock the doors) but was their conspiracy?
* Rule: Fact finder may infer the agreement from the circumstances; direct proof is not necessary
* Holding: No, the court said that Perry may have known about the illegal act, but simply knowing is not enough or conspiracy
  * Perry indicates that a key inquiry in cases involving multiple parties to crimes is to determine whether the parties are acting together based on an agreement or whether they are acting independently, albeit in parallel with one another
    * No evidence in the record to establish the existence of an agreement or intent to conspire
  * When there is independent, parallel actions occurring – there is no conspiracy
* Notes
  * Some jurisdictions -- > will say that simply knowing about another’s criminal plans and not doing anything counts as implicit conspiracy
* *Interstate Circuit City v Dallas* – Inferring Conspiracy
  * SCOTUS case where prosecutors alleged that movie distributors entered into a conspiracy among themselves not to distribute movies unless they all charged 25 cents. This way they could all drive up prices
  * SCOTUS found that we can infer conspiracy here because it would be against each individual business distributor to charge 25 cents without this agreement (because otherwise they would be undercut by lower prices)
  * They wouldn’t engage in this conspiracy but-for this conspiracy (game-theory element to this factual scenario)

### *People v Lauria* (1967 CA) – Mens Rea for Conspiracy
  
* Facts: Telephone answering services that take messages for missed calls is owned and operated by D. The prosecutor’s theory was that D conspired because he knew that a prostitution ring would use this service to get their assignments
* Question: Under what circumstances does a supplier become a part of a conspiracy to further an illegal enterprise by furnishing goods or services which he knows are to be used for criminal purposes?
* Rule: **Both element of knowledge of illegal use of goods AND element of intent to further that use must be present for conspiracy**
  * **Intent of supplier, who knows of criminal use to which his services are put, to participate in the connected criminal activity is established by**
    1. **Direct evidence that he intends to participate OR**
    1. **Through an inference that he intends to participate based on:**
       1. **His special interest in the activity OR**
       1. **The aggravated nature of the crime**
* Holding: Court upholds finding that absolved D of conspiracy charge
  * Lauria indisputably knew that some of his customers were prostitutes, thus this case hinges on the finding of intent
  * Since direct proof is lacking, intent to further criminal purpose must be inferred from circumstances and the sale itself. Court identifies different ways intent can be inferred:
    1. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal goods for illegal use has acquired a stake in the venture
    1. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for the goods or services exits
    1. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of business with the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, or when sales for illegal use amount to a high proportion of the seller’s total business.
  * However, there are also cases in which there was no personal stake or special interest, yet liability was held on the sole basis of knowledge due to the nature of the criminal conduct
    * Duty to take positive action to dissociate oneself from criminal activities is far stronger/compelling for serious crimes
    * Derives from societal duty imposed on all to suppress heinous crime
  * In any case, there was no evidence in record that D took any direct action to further/encourage/direct activities nor circumstances that would suggest special interest in doing so. Likewise, underlying crime is non-violent misdemeanor

### *Pinkerton v United States* (1946)

* Facts - Ds were brothers who lived a short distance from each other on farm. Brothers were indicted for various violations of IRC. A jury found D1 guilty on nine of the ten substantive counts and on a conspiracy count, and found D2 guilty on six of the ten substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. Each brother was fined and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. No evidence that D2 directly participated in the substantive offenses - he was in prison for a part of the period over which the offense was committed
* Question - Can D2 be found guilty of substantive offenses if it was found that he was party to unlawful conspiracy and the substantive offenses were committed in furtherance of it?
* Rule - **In an ongoing conspiracy, the overt act of one co-conspirator may be the act of all conspirators without any new agreement specifically directed to that act**
* Holding - Yes, D2 was part of continuous conspiracy and can be held vicariously liable for substantive offense
  * No affirmative action by D2 to establish his withdrawal from the conspiracy. Until he does some act to disavow or defeat the purpose, he is still offending for as long as the offense has not been terminated
  * When there is conspiracy to commit illegal acts, criminal intent to commit the substantive offenses has been achieved, regardless of who actually commits the illegal substantive offense. It was formed for purpose of executing the act and the act is done in execution of the enterprise
    * This is the same underlying principle for holding responsible individuals who command/counsel another to commit a crime
* Dissent
  * No evidence that D2 was involved in these offenses. He was in prison for a majority of this time
  * Result of the majority's holding is vicarious criminal liability is equally broad or broader than vicarious liability for acts done by co-partner in course of crime
* Lecture Commentary:
  * In the absence of providing assistance or encouragement, there is probably no liability here for aiding or abetting - there is no duty to prevent the crime
    * Prosecution has a different theory - D2 had more than just knowledge, but initially agreed that they would work together. Court says that this is enough to hold him vicariously liable. Once a conspiracy is established, you can be held responsible for any acts in furtherance of it, regardless if your lack of participation is insufficient to constitute aiding and abetting
  * Foreseeability applied to the facts of *Pinkerton*
    * Hypothetical - Assume that the facts are the same, but while D2 is in jail, D1 acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. During one of the acts, he encounters and assaults a police officer. Is D2 vicariously liable?
      * The offense here is difficult to view as "in furtherance" of the conspiracy, but rather something that simply arose in the process of executing it. It also clearly exceeded the scope of the agreement. However, the question is whether or not D2 could still be vicariously liable on the grounds that such an act was reasonably foreseeable as the probable result of the conspiracy. In argument could be made for both sides in that question
  * Exceptions that discharge this liability:
    1. You can withdraw from a conspiracy through some affirmative act, though this must meet a high standard
    1. End of conspiracy - the offense by a co-conspirator occurred after what was conspired about had already been accomplished

### *State v. Bridges* (1993 NJ)

* Facts - Ds get into a fight with a guest at the part, leave, and come back with friends who brought guns. Friends brought guns to hold everyone at bay while Bridges fights it out with the guest. Someone in crowd hits one of the friend in the face. Friends begin recklessly firing and someone is fatally shot. These seems to show enough for conspiracy among the three friends; but the agreement is one that the friends are supposed to just keep people at bay
* Rule - **A co-conspirator may be liable for substantive criminal acts not committed by him and outside the scope of the conspiracy if they are reasonably foreseeable as the necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy**
  * If criminal acts exceed the scope of what is conspired to, intent doesn't matter if these acts were reasonably foreseeable
* Holding - Ds are criminally responsible under the circumstances
  * Court rejects standard that there is only vicarious liability between co-conspirators when there is shared intent/purpose
    * They argue this is misunderstanding of *Pinkerton* standard, the purpose of which is to impose vicarious liability based on objective standard of reasonable foreseeability (i.e. broader and lest strict than accomplice accountability)
  * There is evidence that jury could conclude there is reasonably foreseeable risk that as probable consequence of carrying out plan to intimidate with loaded guns was that someone would be shot
* Dissent - No liability is foreseen other than for the crime that were the object of the conspiracy
* Lecture Commentary:
  * Goes even further than *Pinkerton* in expanding vicarious liability
  * Is there a Mens Rea problem here? How can we describe D's state of mind. It wasn’t his purpose that his co-conspirator kills. Had he known they would do this, he probably wouldn't have agreed to what was conspired
  * **More importantly, how do we reconcile this with the intent requirement that exists in almost all formulations of conspiracy?**

### *US v. Alvarez* (1985 11th Cir.)

* Facts: Undercover sting operation for drug buying. While the transaction is going on in the house, the agents move in too quickly and a shootout begins killing an officer. The person who shot the officer is liable for homicide, though 3 others involved in the operation were also charged with 2nd degree murder even though they didn't take part in the shooting
* Issue: Is everyone involved in the drug deal is liable for the death?
* Holding: Yes. *Pinkerton* liability was properly imposed on those who were part of the operation but didn't take part in the shooting
  * Court says there is evidence to find that murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy. The planned sale was for an abnormally large volume and based on the money involved, good reason to expect buyers to be carrying weapons and to use deadly force if necessary
* Question: Did the court get it right here? The relationship between the actual conspiracy and the murder seems pretty remote. Is this a probable consequence or a fluke?

### Accomplice and Conspiracy Hypotheticals

* Note: When it comes to sentencing, you either are sentenced for conspiracy OR accomplice liability, not both. Though the substantive crimes stack up (Conspiracy/Accomplice + Substantive Crimes). That’s why we’re interested in whether the substantive crimes are imputed
* Factual Setup: A is the organizer and ringleader of a conspiracy to rob banks. He hires B and C to rob banks 1 and 2, respectively. Although B and C do not meet face to face and do not know each other, the both know that they are members of a larger conspiracy, and each knows of the other’s assignment with respect to the two banks. A then gets D, who also knows of the larger conspiracy, to steal a car for use in both bank robberies. B and C then rob banks and 1 and 2, but only B uses the car stolen by D
* What is A criminally responsible for?
  * Under Pinkerton liability, A is guilty for all substantive offenses committed by B, C, and D. These acts were clearly in furtherance of the conspiracy which A facilitated.
  * If prosecutors instead try to impose accomplice liability, they need to show that there’s aiding and abetting. Here, A directed and funded the entire operation in furtherance of the crimes so it would have the same outcome as *Pinkerton*
* What is B/C criminally responsible for?
  * Prosecutors will argue that B and C are part of a conspiracy via Pinkerton and therefore B is liable for C’s crime. Defense will argue that there are only two different conspiracy – Between A-B and A-C
    * However, this might be a more difficult question because it seems like B knew C was committing the crime. Especially if B and C are sharing the profits as part of A’s conspiracy, it definitely seems like there would be Pinkerton liability
    * B and C probably not liable as accomplices to each other; there’s no evidence that they aided and abetted each other in helping to rob their respective bank. Depending if you expand complicity theory (i.e. *Luperello*) – you might be able to get there, though probably not
* What is D criminally responsible for?
  * There is likely *Pinkerton* liability for B & C's crimes. D is part of the conspiracy. What B did was in furtherance of the conspiracy and D’s robbed car has helped
  * *Pinkerton* Liability for C's robbery not as easy since C didn't use stolen car. The prosecutor’s argument is that it doesn’t matter under Pinkerton who uses the car – you’re agreement is to steal the car for use in either case. It matters for accomplice liability, but not conspiracy
    * This is an example of conspiracy being broader than accomplice liability
  * D is also liable for the offenses as an accomplice to B because his stolen car aids and abets the robbery
  * However, because C did not use the car, there is no accomplice liability here
* What is D wasn’t able to steal the car? Can D still be charged?
  * Yes with *Pinkerton*. Once you’re in the agreement anything done in furtherance of the crime by co-conspirators makes you liable as well
  * However, in this case, you couldn't impose on D any accomplice liability to B or C
* Are B & C both responsible for D’s theft?
  * Under *Pinkerton* – it’s easy if B, C, and D meet together – then everything’s in furtherance. If it’s not that clean, then the argument would have to be that B and C are responsible because it’s foreseeable that bank robbers might need a car and someone in the conspiracy is actually doing this
  * Under accomplice theory, question becomes whether B or C had done anything to encourage and assist D to steal the car. It probably wasn’t B’s purpose that D steal the car. The question is whether B and C encouraged D to do it. Probably a stretch, you’d have to argue – but for the bank robbery plans, D wouldn’t steal the car
