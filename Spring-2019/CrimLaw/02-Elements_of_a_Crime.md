# Elements of a Crime

## Mens Rea

### MPC Definitions

* **Culpability** - Unless otherwise provided by statute or existing law a person is not guilty of an offense unless they acted purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently as the law may require with respect to each material element of the offense
* **Purposefully** - A person acts purposefully with respect to a material element of a crime if it the conscious object to engage in such conduct and cause such result OR he is aware of attendant circumstances or believes/hopes the exist
* **Knowingly** -  A person acts knowingly with respect to an element if practically certain that conduct will cause such result and aware of the nature of the conduct or attendant circumstances
* **Recklessly** -  A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such that, based on circumstances known to the actor, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the reasonable person standard of conduct
* **Negligently** - A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.

### Negligence

### Knowledge

* Contrasted with recklessness
  * Recklessness is to consciously disregard a substantial risk of the conduct causing harm (MPC §2.02(2))
  * Knowledge is awareness that the harm is practically certain
* Awareness of high probability as knowledge
  * *Jewell* (1976) 9th CC
    * Facts - D caught transporting drugs in his car from MX into US, and D claimed he didn’t know drugs were there.  Circumstantial evidence that D knew of the compartment but acted w/ willful blindness to confirming it.  D convicted of drug trafficking (judge jury instruction that D’s willful blindness sufficient), but D argued requires D must “absolutely, positively” know the drugs were in the compartment
    * Holding - “Knowingly” includes “willful blindness” (ie. D’s awareness of the high probability of an illegal act, but purposefully failing to investigate the illegal act’s existence to remain ignorant). Court provides both policy and substantive for rejecting the "willful blindness" defense: Substantive - Deliberate ignorance is equally culpable as positive knowledge; Policy - This would be used as a defense by drug traffickers in order to avoid punishment
    * Dissent (Kennedy): Proper jury instruction must clearly state requirements of culpability: that D is aware of facts indicating high probability, that D does not actually believe there was no controlled substance in the car (subjective standard). The instructions were thus defective; proper instruction based on MPC should use its definition of knowledge, not an alternative to it (i.e. a separate willful blindness standard)
  * Federal standard
    * (1) Where an individual subjectively believes the probability that a fact exists is high AND (2) the individual takes deliberate actions to avoid learning this fact, then this type of awareness is more culpable than recklessness (i.e. on the same level as knowledge)
    * However, there remains questions about whether this requires an affirmative act to avoid learning the truth (i.e. take steps to ensure one doesn't acquire knowledge). If this is the standard, it is unlikely that failure to investigate (e.g. *Jewell*) is any more culpable than recklessness

### Strict Liability (No Mens Rea)

* *Morrissette v. United States* (1952) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking and selling military scrap metal in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641 “converting gov property” law (judge jury instruction that offense is SL b/c law had no culpability requirement), but D argued MOF defense that he honestly believed the government had abandoned the metal and had no intent to convert.
  * Holding - Fed laws related to conversion or other wrongful acts that are silent on a required culpability element are not to be interpreted as eliminating the requirement for a culpability element. Even though there are public welfare laws intended to reduce immediate danger posed by certain actions through strict liability, larceny is a crime that has historically required mental element. Thus, this type of offense shouldn't be interpreted as a public welfare one where the statute is silent regarding intent
* *Staples v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of owning semi-automatic rifle (D’s gun had defective piece meant to prevent automatic firing) in violation of US National Firearms Act (judge jury instruction that Act makes it SL offense), but D argued MoF defense that he didn’t know it could fire automatically. SCOTUS grants cert to address issue where, absent a clear statement from Congress that there is no mens rea requirement, should federal felony statutes be interpreted the eliminate the mens rea element?
  * Holding - Fed laws should not be interpreted as strict liability (i.e. eliminating mens rea requirement), UNLESS Congress clearly stated otherwise. Court has been careful not to interpret statutes as eliminating the mens rea requirement where seemingly innocent conduct would be criminalized. Since default rule would thus provide mens rea requirement for illegal possession of firearm, D is not culpable for unknowingly possessing an illegal firearm
  * Dissent - the Act meant for public welfare regulation similar to *Balint*

## Defenses to Culpability

* **MPC 2.04**
  1. MoF or MoL is a defense IF either:
     1. D’s MOF or MOL negates a material element of an offense (see Cordoba-Hincapie)
        * Subjective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Purposely, Knowingly, or Recklessly
        * Objective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Negligently (ie. MoF < “gross deviation”)
     1. relevant statute establishes MoF or MOL as defense to required culpability
  1. MoF or MoL for one offense does NOT transfer to another related offense, but could mitigate culpability for it
  1. Additionally, MoL is a defense IF
     1. Relevant statute not “reasonably made available” (NOTE: very low bar)
     1. D acts w/ reasonable reliance on official statement of law (NOT attorney)
  1. MoF or MoL standard is ONLY “more likely than not” NOT “beyond reasonable doubt

### Mistake of Fact

* MPC Approach
  * Mistake of fact is inseparable from mens rea analysis. Thus, it must be determined whether the mistake of fact negates required negates the required level of culpability for the material elements of the offense
* Current Law
  * MPC has had a major impact, yet some elements of the traditional approach from *Prince* continue to dominate
    * Lesser-crime principle - When D knowingly commits smaller crime, he runs risk of committing even greater crime. Thus, MoF not a valid defense in these situations
    * Moral-wrong principle - where committing an act that is morally questionable/wrong, person runs risk of committing crime crime
* *Regina v. Prince* (1875) (England)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking unmarried girl under 16yo, but D argued MoF b/c reasonably believed the girl was over 16yo b/c she was 18 and she looked much older than 16
  * Holding - If statute lacks culpability requirement (ie. SL offense), then D’s MoF is not a defense
* *B (a minor) v. Director of Public Prosecutions* (2000) (British House of Lords)
  * Facts - D (15-yo boy) convicted of violating Indecency w/ Child Act after asking 13yo girl to perform oral sex, but D argued evidence showed he honestly believed girl was 14yo (age of consent)
  * Holding - Courts should read in a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape rape unless legislature clearly intended NOT to include one, so mistake of fact is defense to statutory rape. Holds that *Prince* is out of line with the modern trend of criminal law in which a D should be judgd on the facts as he believes them to be
* *Garnett v. State* (1993) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D (20yo mentally handicapped man) invited by 13yo girl (minor) to have sex.  D convicted of second degree rape (max 20 year sentence) under MD law defining it as sex between victim under 14yo and person more than four years older
  * Holding - Courts should NOT read a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape law unless the legislature clearly intended for one; so MoF is NOT defense to statutory rape. Court thinks its clear that the statute makes no allowance for a mistake-of-age defense, effectively rendering it a strict liability offense
    * This ruling goes in opposite direction than the one modern criminal law is trending towards (in which the traditional insistence on imposing strict liability for mistakes about age is beginning to erode)
  * Dissent - Not requiring state to prove necessary mental state "destroys absolutely the concept of fault" and renders meaningless the presumption of innocence and right to due process

### Mistake of Law

* Definition: A defense that D incorrectly understood how applicable law applies to their conduct
  * Traditional rule is that "ignorance of the law is no excuse" and that MoL is never a valid defense
  * This turns out to be murky and not always the case, increasingly so over the last 50 years
* MPC
  * §2.02(9) - Knowledge/negligence as to whether conducts constitutes an offense is not a requirement of the offense unless the definition/code specifically provides so
    * Some courts have read requirement of statutory awareness into federal statutes (e.g. *Liparota*), while others maintain that only awareness of the conduct is relevant to willfulness/knowledge (e.g. *Overholt*). The former seem to be concerned with criminalizing seemingly innocent conduct
  * §2.04 - Reflects view that punishment in official reliance MoL cases are pointless and unfair. Adopts limited defense for situation in which D reasonably relies on official interpretation (...afterwards determined to be invalid of erroneous)
* MoL Policy Implications
  * Arguments for barring MoL defense
    * Encourages people to know the law and disincentivizes ignorance of the law
    * Imposes duty to act cautiously and inquire about the law’s full extent (responsible citizenry)
  * Criticisms of not recognizing MoL defense
    * May impose liability w/o culpability
    * Muddled w/ MoF - unfair that D required to know law, but not required to know fact in MoF
    * Abundance modern criminal laws, difficult to know them all
    * Proposed 2015 H.R. would reform criminal code to provide broader MoL defense use in federal statute cases where law is silent. Proponents say this is a necessary safeguard against overcriminalization
* Circumstances in which MoL has been recognized as a valid defense
  * Specific intent crimes such as:
    * Property Damage - D reasonably believed the property damaged is his own (Smith)
    * Theft - D takes something he subjectively believed that he was entitled to or owned
    * Entrapment - if someone committed an act b/c governmental rep said it was lawful (Raley)
* *People v. Marrerro* (1987) (NY CoLR)
  * Facts - D (correction officers) convicted of carrying loaded firearm while off-duty in violation of statute, but D argued good faith MoL that he believed the statute exception for “peace officers” applied to correction officers. Thus, D argues that his mistaken belief about his conduct was founded upon an “official statement” of the law contained in the statute, which wsa reasonable in view of the ambiguous wording of the “peace officer” exemption, and that his “reasonable” interpretation of an “official statement” is sufficient to satisfy statutory requirements for MoL defense
  * Holding - MoL, even good faith, is not a defense. Recognizing misinterpretation of a statute would encourage ignorance of the law
  * DISSENT - “Ignorance of law is no excuse” is antiquated and impossible to follow considering the numerous laws now in existence AND D made “mistaken belief” upon an “official statement” of the statute. Rudovsky think dissent gets it right
* *Regina v. Smith* (1974) (England)
  * Facts - D (tenant) convicted of theft for removed wiring he had installed in the wall in violation of statute saying items installed in wall become landlord property, but D argued MoL (thought property was his) so lacked culpability
  * Holding - MoL is defense to civil law, not criminal law, because demonstrates lack of culpability
* *Cheek v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of failing to file federal income taxes, but D argued MoL b/c he believed taxes were illegal
  * Holding - Whether a good-faith MoL is sufficient to negate intent requirement of willfulness is (i) a question of fact for the jury (ii) and not subject to an objective reasonableness standard
  * Reasoning - A defendant will satisfy the willfulness requirement if she made a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.” This means that the defendant must (1) know about the duty and (2) purposely violate it. Here it is clear there was no innocent mistake and that a known duty was simply ignored out of disagreement
* *Lambert v. California* (1957) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of violating LA statute requiring prior-convicted felons to register, but D argued he had no knowledge of the statute
  * Holding - Due process limitations require that D be shown to know he is violating this law
    * Notice is essential component of due process and is applicable where person is wholly passive and unaware of wrongdoing. Without notice, there is no opportunity to comply and avoid the conduct
  * DISSENT - Many laws are unknown to people to whom the laws apply; Majority draws impossible constitutional line between doing and not doing
