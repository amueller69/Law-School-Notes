# Elements of a Crime

* Concept of Culpability - This is endorsed fully by the MPC and by the common law (generally) that in order to be held criminally liable, you need the guilty mind (mens rea) and an action on the guilty mind (actus reus). That is, we don’t punish people for evil thoughts

## Actus Reus

* There is a difference between voluntary and blameworthy acts - Actus Reus is only one component for criminal liability; it is **necessary but not sufficient**
* Components of Actus Reus - It generally includes three ingredients of a crime:
  1) A voluntary act;
  2) that causes;
  3) a social harm
     * Both “voluntary acts” and “social harms” are the terms of art that require special attention
* MPC 2.01
  * (1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable
  * (2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section:
    * (a) a reflex or convulsion;
    * (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
    * (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
    * (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual
  * (3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:
    * (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or
    * (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law
  * (4) Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession

* Voluntariness Requirement:
  * Narrow Meaning: A movement of the body which follows our volition
    * Put in another way – a voluntary act is one that involves use off the human mind (thinking notion of free will) and an involuntary act involves the use of the human brain (mechanical functioning of the brain)
    * However, something is not voluntary just because the person is unaware what they are doing…the law treats habitual acts as falling on the voluntary side of the continuum, even if the ultimate action related is involuntary (i.e. habit of smoking and you light up without thinking so often you burn down a house)
  * Broad Meaning: The defendant possessed sufficient free choice to be blamed for his conduct
  * MPC definition of Voluntary: “bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary.” But what level of involuntary movement is considered appropriate?
  * Do All Elements Have to be Voluntary? Under the MPC, it seems that only one element of the crime must be voluntary. So going back to Martin perhaps all they needed was the voluntary act of drunkenness to convict
    * Would we get better deterrence in Martin’s case if we only require the voluntary act of drunkenness and just found people culpable if they voluntarily or involuntarily ended up in the street
      * But does this unfairly restrict the lawful liberty to drink?
  * Rationale: Why should a person whose involuntary act causes harm to anther escape punishment? One frequent explanation is that the law cannot deter involuntary movement. It would make no sense for the utilitarian to support punishment for involuntary acts. But it would make sense if the utilitarian could prove the punishing involuntary behavior would incentive people to adjudge behavior in the first place. The criminal justice system is another mechanism for social control
    * The voluntary act requirement is far more closely linked to retributivism's respect for human autonomy
    * The theory is one that is premised on the view that ‘the critical distinction between criminal law and other systems of confinement is that the criminal sanction carries with it something more – stigmatization of moral blameworthiness

* Omissions
  * General Principle – Very Few Affirmative Duties. Not every moral obligation to act creates a concomitant legal duty. Subject to a few limited exceptions, a person has no criminal law duty to act to prevent harm to another; even if she can do so at no risk to herself, and even if the person imperiled may lose her life in the absence of assistance
    * The utilitarian view would obviously find the law severely deficient in this respect
  * Common Law - Liability for a criminal offense may be predicated on an omission, rather than on a voluntary act. Such cases involve what may by termed “commission by omission” liability
    * **When a common law duty to act exists, and assuming that she was physically capable of performing that act, a defendant’s omission of the duty to act serves as a legal substitute for a voluntary act**
    * When is there a Duty to Act?
      * **Status Relationships** - A person will have a common law duty to act IF they have a special status in relation to the other. Examples include parents to their minor children, married couples to one another, employers to employees, inviters to invitees
      * **Contractual Obligation** - A duty to act may be created by implied or express contract. For example, one who breaches an agreement to house, feed, and provide medical care to an infirm stranger...
      * **Creation of a Risk** - A person who wrongfully harms another or another’s property, or who wrongfully places a person or her property in jeopardy of harm, has a common law duty to aid the injured or endangered party.
        * Culpable Injuries Caused – If D negligently injuries V, D has a common law duty to render aid to V. If D fails to do so, and V dies as a the result of the omission, D may be held criminally liable for V’s death.
        * Non Culpable Injuries Caused – Although there is considerably less case law in this respect, a duty to act arguably arises from non-culpable risk-creation as well. For example, a few courts have held that one who accidentally starts a house fire can be held liable for arson if she fails to extinguish the fire or seek proper help. There is also some authority for the proposition that even one justifiably shoots an aggressor in self-defense, seriously wounding them, may have a subsequent duty to obtain medical aid for the wounded once they no longer pose a threat
      * **Voluntary Assistance** -  Once you start to commence aiding someone then you have the duty to continue to provide aid. Moreover, you’re under the duty to render as helpful aid you can
      * **Statutory Duties** & Bad Samaritan Laws - Statutes can create affirmative duties. For example, having a drivers license creates a duty to stop a care at the scene of a car accident you’re in
        * Bad Samaritan laws are those that make it a misdemeanor for a person not to render aid to a stranger in peril. Very few states adopt this standard, but they exist. Critics assert that either nobody can be fairly prosecuted under them when multiple people are available for rescue, or it just gives the prosecutor too much arbitrary power
  * MPC Approach - The MPC does not differ significantly from the common law regarding omissions. Liability based on omission is permitted in two circumstances: 1) if the law defining the offense provides for it; or 2) if the duty to act is “otherwise imposed by law.” The latter category incorporates duties arising under civil law (i.e. torts and contract)

* Public Policy Rationale
  * Purpose of Actus Reus:
    * Criminal law shouldn’t punish thoughts alone (although some crimes such as conspiracy involve planning)
    * Criminal law can’t deter involuntary actions (Newton) or involuntary conditions (Jones v. LA)
    * Involuntary actors should get treatment, not criminal stigma(Robinson)
      * Blurry line between “voluntary” and “involuntary” (compare Martin to Low, see Powell and Moore)
  * Purpose of no Affirmative Duty to Act:
    * Individual autonomy (law doesn’t want to compel people to act a certain way)
    * Immoral actions are not always equate to criminal
    * Risks possible harm to self or others in some cases
    * May lead to over-deterrence (ie. people act too often even in cases not requiring assistance)
    * Bystander Effect - People people generally don’t act b/c don’t want to risk failure, people fear risking injury, and free-rider problem (figure someone else will act) (ex: New Bedford and Kitty Genovese cases)
  * Rotten Social Background (RSB) theory
    * Should coming from an underprivileged, poverty background affect actus reus determinations b/c the alleged criminal might not have known any better. On the one hand, seems fairer, but may be too ambiguous, exploitable, paternalistic, categorical, and broader social issue outside criminal law

### Martin v State (1944 AL)

* Facts: D was convicted of being drunk on a public highway. Officers arrested him at home and brought him to the highway where his drunken shouts and profane language caused him to be in violation of a statute preventing drunk people from appearing drunk in a public place
* Rule: **Criminal liability may only be imposed when the unlawful conduct is committed voluntarily**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed
  * Criminal liability always requires element actus reus, that is, the commission of some voluntary act that is prohibited by law
  * Culpability cannot be established (because) proof that the accused, while in an intoxicated condition was involuntarily and forcibly carried to that place by the arresting officer
* Lecture Analysis: The statute requires someone to be drunk AND on a public highway. Martin unquestionably voluntarily got drunk, but involuntary was brought on a highway. If we hold to the MPC, then perhaps we only need one act
  * But this case is interesting because it brings up for debate whether you need voluntary act to convict or all of them
* Notes: When is an Act Voluntary or Involuntary?
  * *People v Lowe*: Man was arrested and brought to jail. He also had drugs in his socks. When the police found out, he was charged with violating a statue concerned with “knowingly brining a controlled substances into jail.” CA Supreme Court upheld the conviction distinguishing from Martin by holding that the man had a **voluntary opportunity to relinquish** the drugs prior to entering the premises
  * *State v Eaton*: Same facts as Lowe, but here the court said that the so-called “voluntary act” of relinquishing the drugs isn’t really a true choice. “The defendant had **no available choice** other than to surrender evidence that would convict him of another crime, and therefore failing to read a voluntariness requirement into the statute would produce absurd results”
  * *Jones v City of LA*: Homeless men convicted of violating ordinances by sleeping on sidewalks. Arguing that there were not enough homeless shelters, the homeless had **no choice** but to sleep on the sidewalks, the court agreed that the criminal act was not voluntary

### People v Newton – The Scope of Involuntary Movement Sufficient for Actus Reus

* Facts: D was pulled over by police officers. There was an altercation and one of the officers was shot after D was shot. D argues that his gun-shot wound produced and unconscious/reflexive shot reaction that caused him to shoot the police officer. Expert witness testified that D's recollections were “compatible” with the gunshot he had received and that it was common for a person to go into a reflex shock condition causing loss of consciousness for short periods of time following a gunshot wound that penetrates the abdominal cavity. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the subject of unconsciousness as a defense to D's offense and D is convicted
* Issue: Was it improper not to instruct jury that non self-inflicted unconsciousness  is a complete defense?
* Rule: **Involuntary movement not self-inflicted or self-knowledgeable (e.g. Non self-induced unconsciousness) cannot be the basis for actus reus**
* Holding: Conviction reversed
  * Although the evidence surrounding the events is confusing and conflicting, some of it supports the inference that D had been shot in the abdomen before he fired any shots himself
    * Where evidence of involuntary unconsciousness has been produced in a homicide prosecution, the refusal by the trial court to provide a requested instruction on the subject is prejudicial error
  * Unconsciousness does not just mean a coma or inability of locomotion. Rather, it can exist where the subject physically acts in fact, but is not, at the time conscious of acting. When evidence of involuntary unconsciousness has been produced in a homicide prosecution, the refusal of a requested instruction of the subject is a prejudicial error.

### Voluntariness Hypotheticals

* Hypothetical 1: Going back to Newton, instead of the defense being a physiological reflex to his gunshot wound, suppose because Newton’s been harassed for years by the police, he has a psychological aversion to the police akin to PTSD. If he’s touched by police, he acts almost unconsciously, without almost disregard – not a product of free will. Is this a complete defense like in the actual case?
  * **Maybe not** – the social condition might be really really hard to resist, but a tough temptation is different from complete lack of free will. Hard to say there’s no free will here
  
* Hypothetical 2: Man driving voluntarily has an epileptic seizure and gets into a fatal car accident – didn’t intend to kill anyone, but he had a history of epilepsy and didn’t take his pills. State charges with manslaughter. Convict?
  * **Maybe** – driving with knowledge and foreseeability that this involuntary reflex could occur without taking meds might be enough for gross recklessness.
  
* Hypothetical 3: Same facts of Hypo 2, but instead of epilepsy it’s heart disease and you know you’ve got a history of heart attacks and you haven’t been taking your pills. You have a massive heart attack and get in a fatal car accident. Manslaughter?
  * **Probably not** – Not as foreseeable, there’s a higher foreseeability of seizure. Heart attacks don’t happen as often

### *Robinson v California* (1962)

* Facts: D was convicted under a statue that made it a criminal offense to be addicted to narcotics. The man displayed tissue scaring and needlemarks consistent with narcotics use. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that it could convict *Robinson* if it either found that he used drugs in California or found he was addicted to drugs
* Issue: Is a Pattern of Behavior a Voluntary Act or is imprisoning someone on this basis unconstitutional?
* Rule: A criminal statute that creates a form of continuous criminal liability **that fails to require an act to be performed within the jurisdiction and instead imposes a crime for a status (e.g. disease) is unconstitutional**
* Holding: State law can't impose criminal liability for drug addition, it violates 8A protection against cruel and unusual punishment
  * The trial judge instructed the jury that even if it found *Robinson* had not used drugs, it could still find him in violation of the statute if it found *Robinson* was addicted to drugs. Thus he is punished not for some act, but because of his status
  * It is unlikely that any state at this moment in history would attempt to make it a criminal offense for a person to be mentally ill, or a leper, or to be afflicted with a venereal disease – yet this statue seems to imply such a change could occur
* Concurrence - Drug addiction merely shows his desire to use drugs, and the mere desire to commit a crime is not a criminal act
* Dissent - The conviction was not based solely on his status as a drug addict. The same evidence that proves he was an addict also proves that he regularly used drugs
* Lecture Analysis: Why does the Constitution not allow this type of statute? Much like the above Hypo #2, why can we say “if you know you have seizures regularly and you get into a car and then hurt someone, you’ll be punished.” But we CAN’T say “if you’ll do drugs and then get addicted, you’ll get punished?” In general, the court seems hesitant to hold that Due Process permits punishing people’s status.

### *Powell* v Texas (1968)

* Facts: D was arrested for public intoxication. However, but D offered the defense that his conduct was caused by disease of chronic alcoholism causing him to drink involuntarily. He was convicted anyways
* Rule: The punishment of conduct that is symptomatic of chronic alcoholism is not in violation of 8A
* Holding: Conviction is upheld
  * In *Robinson*, the state sought to punish a mere status and to regulate an individual’s behavior in their own home. Neither of those issues are present here
  * Here, D is **not punished for being a chronic alcoholic. He is punished for breaking the law** by going out in public while intoxicated
  * Additionally, medical research on chronic alcoholism is too vague and unsettled to as to what the disease entails. Would be too hard to formulate a rule that would relieve individuals of guilt and, furthermore, it would be up to the state courts formulate it
* Dissent: D’s alcoholism is disease that involuntarily made D appear in public
* Lecture Analysis: It’s not clear that alcoholism means you have no control over whether to START drinking, but rather it means once you start you can’t stop. But you can decide not to drink
  * This is probably noticeably different than hard drugs. Plus, this statue prevents public intoxication – D still made a choice to go out in public. Could have just gotten drunk in his house
  * Marshall – a liberal who surprisingly sides with the majority here – does so because if he strikes this statue down it might lead to civil commitment statutes that could be used as racial weapons

### *United States v Moore* (1973 DC)

* Facts: D was convicted of heroin possession. Drawing on *Robinson*, he contends the conviction was improper because he was a heroin addict with a need to use it – therefore it’s punishing his addiction to be convicted for carrying the means of his addiction
* Rule: **An individual who evidences an intense dependence on drugs resulting in loss of self-control may not use his behavior impairment as a defense to criminal culpability**
* Holding: D's conviction is upheld - not a valid defense to criminal liability
  * This case presents the court with an opportunity to rely with the *Robinson* precedent or the *Powell*. They chose *Powell* and argue that the underlying possession can be punished
  * “Appellant could never put the needle in his arm the first and many times without an exercise of will. Appellants illegal acquisition and possession was the direct product of a freely willed illegal act. The drug addition is a disease that Appellant has induced himself through a violation of the law. Every addict makes a choice…”
* Dissent: A drug addict should not be convicted for possession of narcotics that are solely for his on use - some addicts have overwhelming psychological and physiological need for these drugs that negate free will
* Notes: Reconciling *Robinson*, *Powell*, and *Moore*?
  * The cases beg the question: If we hold to *Robinson*, then surely possessing drugs is a function of addition. We can hold to *Powell* and say even addicts exercise free will (as the court in *Moore* seems to agree) but then again alcohol addiction seems substantively less addicting. How to reconcile?
    * Indeterminate Argument – It’s just for enforcement to determine who is a using and who is a true addict, so if we catch you with drugs we have to assume the former. Still can’t prosecute based on needle marks
    * Personal Use – Maybe another argument to reconcile is to say that *Moore* just means that if you can prove the drugs were for personal use then *Robinson* controls. But the court makers pretty clear that it’s not the objective
  * **The court relies on *Powell*. Today, *Robinson* has less control and *Powell* is the important case that emphasizes the states’ continued ability to determine punishments**

### *Jones v U.S.* (1962 DC)

* Facts: Ten month-old baby belonging to D’s friends dies of malnourishment after D failed to provide food and necessities. Mother claimed she had contract with D to care for children, but D denied this. D charged with involuntary manslaughter for failure to perform care for child, but D argued jury instruction required jury to find D had a legal duty.
* Rule: **Imposing criminal liability on a D for omission requires proving D had a legal duty to act**
* Holding: Manslaughter conviction reversed
  * A defendant may be convicted for an omission to act if: (1) the defendant was under a statutory obligation to care for the victim, (2) the defendant was in a sufficiently close relationship with the victim, (3) the defendant contractually agreed to provide care for the victim, or (4) the defendant voluntarily took on the care of the victim, such that the victim was secluded from others who might have helped him
  * Trial judge failed to instruct the jury that Jones could only be convicted if there was proof that she was under a legal duty to feed and provide medical care
  * There was no special status duty for the D. The mother had an affirmative duty to provide for the child, but here there is no obvious duty that makes D’s omission improper, must be remanded to be determined by trier of fact

### *Pope v State* (1970 MD)

* Facts: Pope was convicted of felony child abuse. Norris, a friend of hers, lived with Pope and was young mother of three-month old babe. Norris was also mentally ill and killed her baby in a psychotic episode. Pope was present during the attack – was she under obligation to prevent the attack?
* Rule: **Criminal liability may not be imposed upon an individual for failing to fulfill a moral, instead of a legal, obligation**
* Holding: No, Pope had no legal obligation to intervene
  * Pope’s conduct, during and after the acts of abuse, must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child, she was under no legal obligation to do so unless she had responsibility for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute. She may not be punished by our system for failing to fulfil a moral obligation

## Mens Rea

* Conceptions
  * Broad Meaning - The "evil mind" or "The vicious will" - essentially refers to the blameworthiness entailed in choosing to commit a criminal wrong. This requirement reflects the common sense view of justice that blame and punishment are inappropriate in the absence of choice. According to this definition, guilt for an offense is not dependent on proof that the actor caused the proscribed harm with any specific mental state, it is not necessary to show that he committed the offense “knowingly” or with any particular frame of mind
    * For example, in *Reginia v Cunningham* D entered the cellar building, where he tore the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole the coins deposited in the meter. As a consequence, gas escaped from the pipes and nearly asphyxiated V.
      * Although he did not intend to endanger anyone’s life, he was charged because the offense was “whosoever shall maliciously cause to be administered to or taken by annoy other person any poison...shall be guilty"
  * Narrow Meaning – Mens rea may also be defined, as a more formal or technical requirement: the particular mental awareness or intention provided for in the definition of an offense that must accompany the act. This is the “elemental” meaning of mens rea. A person may possess mens rea in the culpability sense of the term, and yet lack the requisite elemental mens rea. Analysis here is limited to determining whether a defendant intended, expected, or should have expected his actions would produce the consequences

* Common Law Distinction Between Specific Intent and General Intent
  * General Intent = any offense from which the only mens rea required was a blameworthy state of mind.
  * Specific Intent = was meant to empathize that the definition of the offense expressly required proof of a particular mens rea
    * The problem is that today most penal statutes expressly include a mens rea term, or a particular state of mind is judicially implied, so the line between “general” and “specific intent” is much more difficult to draw.
    * A good distinction: A specific intent is one in which the definition of the crime:
      * Requires proof of an intention by the actor to perform some future act or achieve some further consequence, beyond the conduct or result that constitutes the social harm of the offense; 2) requires proof of some special motive for the conduct; 3) provides that the actor must be aware of a statutory attendant circumstance
      * An offense that does not contain one of these features is termed “general intent”
    * Example: Common law burglary is defined as “breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony therein.” The actus reus of this offense is complete when the offender breaks and enters another person’s dwelling at night. However, to be guilty of burglary, the actor must intend a further act – commission of a felony inside the dwelling house
      * But that future act is not part of the social harm of the offense; it does not have to occur. Thus, common law burglary is characterized as a specific intent offense.

### MPC Definitions

* **Culpability** - Unless otherwise provided by statute or existing law a person is not guilty of an offense unless they acted purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently as the law may require **with respect to each material element of the offense**
* **Purposefully** - A person acts purposefully with respect to a material element of a crime if it the conscious object to engage in such conduct and cause such result OR he is aware of attendant circumstances or believes/hopes the exist
* **Knowingly** -  A person acts knowingly with respect to an element if practically certain that conduct will cause such result and aware of the nature of the conduct or attendant circumstances
* **Recklessly** -  A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such that, based on circumstances known to the actor, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the reasonable person standard of conduct
* **Negligently** - A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation

* Applying the MPC
  * MPC analysis involves 2 steps:
    1. Determine the "material elements" of an offense - MPC §1.13 provides criteria for determining this
    1. Must determine which type of mens rea is required with respect to each material element
       * Assumption that, if legislature has specified a particular type a culpability as sufficient for an individual material element of the crime, it was meant to apply to all material elements unless a contrary purpose appears

### *Regina v Cunningham* (1957 UK)

* Facts: D removed a gas meter to steal money inside which lead to noxious fumes being funneled into his neighbors house which could have killed her. The issue was the D was charged under a statute prohibiting “malicious” conduct of this kind which the district court interpreted to mean “general wickedness”
* Rule: **The term malice in a criminal statute does not mean general wickedness; it means either (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that was in fact done or (2) reckless disregard of a foreseeable risk that the harm would result**
* Holding: The Court reversed the conviction because "maliciously" was improperly defined by the trial judge. It interpreted "maliciously" to mean foresight to do specific harm rather than general wickedness. Thus, D must have acted maliciously in the gas meter so as to endanger here life
* Lecture Analysis: Doesn’t general wickedness imply foresight to harm and intent? The concept of the overturn here is that the appeals court was concerned about layering culpability – i.e. if you find the stealing of money “generally wicked” then of course you’ll find the release of noxious fumes wicked too. But D’s mental state was clearly not malicious on the level of intent
* Notes: Applying the Mens Rea of MPC to *Cunningham*. Assuming the facts of Cunningham but the mens rea of the MPC, what would each level of culpability look like?:
  * Purpose – I want this person to inhale gas
  * Knowing – There was a very high risk the gas would go through the wall and D hoped by some miracle it wouldn’t but he had
    * (1) Full knowledge of the consequences
    * (2) They were practically certain to occur
  * Reckless – I don’t know that she’ll inhale the gas, but D disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Risk taken with no justification for an action or awareness of it
    * This is where the appeals court in Cunningham seems to place D’s blameworthiness
  * Negligence – Completely unaware the gas will escape or go through the wall, but a reasonable person in D’s shoes would have known
  * Strict Liability – Doesn’t matter

### Negligence

* **Definition** - A person’s conduct is ‘negligent’ if it constitutes a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the actor’s situation. Conduct constitutes such a negligent deviation if the actor fails to appreciate that he is taking an unjustifiable risk of causing harm to another. **It is an objective fault**

* **Reasonableness** - The reasonableness of action can depend on 1) the gravity of the harm that foreseeably would result from the defendant’s conduct; 2) the probability of such harm occurring; and 3) the burden – or loss – to the defendant of desisting from the risky conduct (i.e. the ‘worth’ of taking the risk’)

* **Difference between Criminal and Civil Negligence** - Although rare circumstances exist, “civil negligence ordinarily is considered an inappropriate predicate by which to define criminal conduct.” To establish criminal responsibility for negligence, the prosecution must ordinarily show more than mere deviation from the standard of care that would constitute civil negligence
  * The key is usually a gross amount of negligence to qualify for criminal liability
  * **But gross negligence should not be equated to recklessness**

* Should Negligence Ever be Punished? Mens rea means guilty mind and yet the negligent actor is blamed and punished for what “isn’t in his mind, namely, attention to risk that a reasonable person would display.
  * Retort: Utilitarians argue that punishment for negligence primarily focuses on general deterrence. Retributivists offer competing arguments

* *Reginia v Faulkner*
  * Facts: D attempted to steal rum in the hold of a ship lights a match to see where the rum is and accidentally burns down the ship. D convicted of theft and arson (for arson, judge jury instruction that if D guilty of theft then also liable for arson), he argued that the jury instructions were improper. The question – should there be a difference morally between the person who accidentally does something and someone who doesn’t?
  * Holding: Jury were improperly directed to return guilty verdict upon finding that the firing of the ship, though accidental, was caused by an act done in the course of a felonious operation
    * The statute does not include a culpability standard of simple negligence. There’s probably enough here for simple negligence (though maybe not gross negligence), but the offense requires the act be willful and intentional
    * “If while a person is engaged in committing a felony...he accidentally does some collateral act, which if done willfully would be another felony...he is guilty of the later felony...but I am not prepared without more consideration to give my assent to so wide a proposition”

* *State v Hazelwood* (1997 AK)
  * Facts: Famous ExXon Valdez case – huge oil spill when ship negligently runs aground. Charged under a statute where conduct is a misdemeanor when committed negligently. On appeal, it is overturned on statutory interpretation reasoning that the legislators must have meant gross negligence (i.e. something more than just simple civil negligence)
  * Holding: Ruling the simple negligence would be sufficient to impose criminal liability in the statute, the conviction is overturned
    * **Simple negligence is sufficient to provide assurance that criminal penalties will be imposed only when the conduct at issue is something society can reasonably expected to deter**
  * Lecture Commentary
    * Case shows that courts are philosophically trying to work through whether or not, even when a status authorizes negligence for criminality – there should be something more than simple negligence (e.g. whether gross negligence is enough). Here, it determine that it simple negligence is sufficient

* *Santillanes v. New Mexico* (1993 NM)
  * Facts - D accidentally injured his nephew (minor) in an altercation.  D convicted of child abuse (judge jury instruction that D guilty of child abuse if D failed civil negligence standard), D argued for a heightened standard of criminal negligence
  * Holding - Ordinary civil negligence is not sufficient to impose criminal liability
    * When moral condemnation attaches to conviction of a crime, the **crime should typically reflect mental state warranting such contempt**
    * Court interprets intended scope to punish only conduct that is morally culpable, thus simple negligence standard is not enough

* *Elonis v United States* (2015)
  * Facts: D was charged under a federal statue making it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce “any communication containing any threat...to injury the person of another.” After D’s wife left him, he began posting certain songs and lyrics that would suggest he was threatening his ex-wife. Although he posted disclaimers that the lyrics were “fictions” he was charged under the statute. He requested a jury instruction requiring the jury to find intent to convict him. He was denied the request.
  * Holding: SCOTUS reversed the conviction. He was improperly convicted under a statute with no intent requirement which the court misinterpreted as allowing mens rea to be satisfied by simple negligence through “reasonable person” standard
    * Reasonable person standard is inconsistent with conventional requirement of criminal law - awareness of some wrongdoing
    * If no mental state is defined in the statue, it doesn't mean that none exists and should not be read as dispensing with criminal intent requirement. Criminal wrongdoing must be conscious, negligence cannot be the default. Instead, the general rule is that a guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime

### Recklessness

* **Definition** - Involves conscious risk creation. Most jurisdictions apply a standard that requires proof that the actor disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of which he was aware. According to the prevailing view the line between “criminal negligence” and “recklessness” is not drawn on the basis of the extent of the actor’s deviation from the standard of reasonable care – the deviation is gross or substantial in both cases – but rather is founded on the actor’s state of mind in regard to risk

* **Malice** - Sometimes malice can be used instead of “recklessness” in the common law context -- and often times can mean both intentionally and recklessly causes social harm

* **Contrasted with Negligence**
  * For recklessness, awareness of a risk that is a probability less that substantial certainty is what distinguishes it from negligence. "The risk of which the actor is aware must of course be substantial in order for the recklessness judgement to be made. This risk must also be unjustifiable."
    * Recklessness  = Actor was subjectively aware of the danger but acted anyway
    * Negligence = The actor was not subjectively aware, but should have been
  * Thus, for someone to be guilty of recklessness, the actor must be aware that 1) there is a risk; 2) that the risk is substantial; and 3) that the risk is unjustifiable
    * The MPC seems to require all three – and in practice, the justification for the risk is reserved for the jury to determine
  * Question: Must the actor SUBJECTIVELY believe that the risk is substantial or is this an OBJECTIVE standard?
  * Hypo: D’s trained as a superior marksman – and knows he’s pretty good. He fires a rifle at a backyard chair where children are playing for practice. A friend warns him it’s too dangerous, but he is confident in his award winning shooting skills. He shoots and injuries a child. Reckless?
    * Subjectively: Maybe this is negligence because he thought he was good enough
    * Objectively: A jury would probably say this is reckless

### Knowledge

* Contrasted with recklessness
  * Recklessness is to consciously disregard a substantial risk of the conduct causing harm (MPC §2.02(2))
  * Knowledge is awareness that the harm is practically certain

* Awareness of high probability as knowledge
  * Federal standard
    * (1) Where an individual subjectively believes the probability that a fact exists is high AND (2) the individual takes deliberate actions to avoid learning this fact, then this type of awareness is more culpable than recklessness (i.e. on the same level as knowledge)
    * However, there remains questions about whether this requires an affirmative act to avoid learning the truth (i.e. take steps to ensure one doesn't acquire knowledge). If this is the standard, it is unlikely that failure to investigate (e.g. *Jewell*) is any more culpable than recklessness
  
* *Jewell* (1976) 9th CC
  * Facts - D caught transporting drugs in his car from MX into US, and D claimed he didn’t know drugs were there.  Circumstantial evidence that D knew of the compartment but acted w/ willful blindness to confirming it.  D convicted of drug trafficking (judge jury instruction that D’s willful blindness sufficient), but D argued requires D must “absolutely, positively” know the drugs were in the compartment
  * Holding - **“Knowingly” includes “willful blindness”** (ie. D’s awareness of the high probability of an illegal act, but purposefully failing to investigate the illegal act’s existence to remain ignorant). Court provides both policy and substantive for rejecting the "willful blindness" defense: Substantive - Deliberate ignorance is equally culpable as positive knowledge; Policy - This would be used as a defense by drug traffickers in order to avoid punishment
  * Dissent (Kennedy): Proper jury instruction must clearly state requirements of culpability: that D is aware of facts indicating high probability, that D does not actually believe there was no controlled substance in the car (subjective standard). The instructions were thus defective; proper instruction based on MPC should use its definition of knowledge, not an alternative to it (i.e. a separate willful blindness standard)
    * Ostrich Instructions can be dangerous because they can sometime imply that true ignorance is not an excuse to criminal culpability – it is an excuse. If D genuinely did not believe the drugs were in the car, despite inferential opportunities, this negates “knowing.” The jury needs to be instructed as such
  * Notes: MPC states that “when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist”
    * The doctrine was clarified in Global-Tech Appliance v SEB. To be culpable under the willful blindness doctrine,
      * The defendant must 1) subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and 2) must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.
    * Issue with Affirmative Action: Does failing to take an affirmative action to inquire to ‘learn the truth’ sufficient under a willful blindness doctrine. The SCOTUS has not made a determination as to whether requiring affirmative actions under this doctrine is too strict

### Strict Liability (No Mens Rea)

* *Morrissette v. United States* (1952) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking and selling military scrap metal in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641 “converting gov property” law (judge jury instruction that offense is SL b/c law had no culpability requirement), but D argued MOF defense that he honestly believed the government had abandoned the metal and had no intent to convert
  * Rule: **Acts which are bad in themselves, including larceny, require the element of mens rea and any similar strict liability statute will not be construed as eliminating the mens rea element**
  * Holding - Fed laws related to conversion or other wrongful acts that are silent on a required culpability element are not to be interpreted as eliminating the requirement for a culpability element. Even though there are public welfare laws intended to reduce immediate danger posed by certain actions through strict liability, larceny is a crime that has historically required mental element. Thus, this type of offense shouldn't be interpreted as a public welfare one where the statute is silent regarding intent

* *Staples v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of owning semi-automatic rifle (D’s gun had defective piece meant to prevent automatic firing) in violation of US National Firearms Act (judge jury instruction that Act makes it SL offense), but D argued MoF defense that he didn’t know it could fire automatically. SCOTUS grants cert to address issue where, absent a clear statement from Congress that there is no mens rea requirement, should federal felony statutes be interpreted the eliminate the mens rea element?
  * Rule: **Absent a clear statement from Congress that there is no mens rea requirement, federal felony statutes should not be interpreted so as to eliminate the element of mens rea**
  * Holding - Fed laws should not be interpreted as strict liability (i.e. eliminating mens rea requirement), UNLESS Congress clearly stated otherwise. Court has been careful not to interpret statutes as eliminating the mens rea requirement where seemingly innocent conduct would be criminalized. Since default rule would thus provide mens rea requirement for illegal possession of firearm, D is not culpable for unknowingly possessing an illegal firearm
  * Dissent - the Act meant for public welfare regulation similar to *Balint*

## Defenses to Culpability

* **MPC 2.04**
  1. MoF or MoL is a defense IF either:
     1. D’s MOF or MOL negates a material element of an offense (see Cordoba-Hincapie)
        * Subjective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Purposely, Knowingly, or Recklessly
        * Objective MoF or MOL negates required culpability of Negligently (ie. MoF < “gross deviation”)
     1. relevant statute establishes MoF or MOL as defense to required culpability
  1. MoF or MoL for one offense does NOT transfer to another related offense, but could mitigate culpability for it
  1. Additionally, MoL is a defense IF
     1. Relevant statute not “reasonably made available” (NOTE: very low bar)
     1. D acts w/ reasonable reliance on official statement of law (NOT attorney)
  1. MoF or MoL standard is ONLY “more likely than not” NOT “beyond reasonable doubt

### Mistake of Fact

* MPC Approach
  * Mistake of fact is inseparable from mens rea analysis. Thus, it must be determined whether the mistake of fact negates required level of culpability for the material elements of the offense

* Current Law
  * MPC has had a major impact, yet some elements of the traditional approach from *Prince* continue to dominate
    * Lesser-crime principle - When D knowingly commits smaller crime, he runs risk of committing even greater crime. Thus, MoF not a valid defense in these situations
    * Moral-wrong principle - where committing an act that is morally questionable/wrong, person runs risk of committing crime
  
* *Prince* (1875) (England)
  * Facts - D convicted of taking unmarried girl under 16yo, but D argued MoF b/c reasonably believed the girl was over 16yo b/c she was 18 and she looked much older than 16
  * Holding - If statute lacks culpability requirement (ie. SL offense), then D’s MoF is not a defense
  
* *B (a minor) v. Director of Public Prosecutions* (2000) (British House of Lords)
  * Facts - D (15-yo boy) convicted of violating Indecency w/ Child Act after asking 13yo girl to perform oral sex, but D argued evidence showed he honestly believed girl was 14yo (age of consent)
  * Holding - Courts should read in a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape rape unless legislature clearly intended NOT to include one, so mistake of fact is defense to statutory rape. Holds that *Prince* is out of line with the modern trend of criminal law in which a D should be judgd on the facts as he believes them to be
  
* *Garnett v. State* (1993) (MD CoLR)
  * Facts - D (20yo mentally handicapped man) invited by 13yo girl (minor) to have sex.  D convicted of second degree rape (max 20 year sentence) under MD law defining it as sex between victim under 14yo and person more than four years older
  * Holding - Courts should NOT read a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape law unless the legislature clearly intended for one; so MoF is NOT defense to statutory rape. Court thinks its clear that the statute makes no allowance for a mistake-of-age defense, effectively rendering it a strict liability offense
    * This ruling goes in opposite direction than the one modern criminal law is trending towards (in which the traditional insistence on imposing strict liability for mistakes about age is beginning to erode)
  * Dissent - Not requiring state to prove necessary mental state "destroys absolutely the concept of fault" and renders meaningless the presumption of innocence and right to due process

### Mistake of Law

* Definition: A defense that D incorrectly understood how applicable law applies to their conduct
  * Traditional rule is that "ignorance of the law is no excuse" and that MoL is never a valid defense
  * This turns out to be murky and not always the case, increasingly so over the last 50 years
  
* MPC
  * §2.02(9) - Knowledge/negligence as to whether conducts constitutes an offense is not a requirement of the offense unless the definition/code specifically provides so
    * Some courts have read requirement of statutory awareness into federal statutes (e.g. *Liparota*), while others maintain that only awareness of the conduct is relevant to willfulness/knowledge (e.g. *Overholt*). The former seem to be concerned with criminalizing seemingly innocent conduct
  * §2.04 - Reflects view that punishment in official reliance MoL cases are pointless and unfair. Adopts limited defense for situation in which D reasonably relies on official interpretation (...afterwards determined to be invalid of erroneous)
  
* MoL Policy Implications
  * Arguments for barring MoL defense
    * Encourages people to know the law and disincentivizes ignorance of the law
    * Imposes duty to act cautiously and inquire about the law’s full extent (responsible citizenry)
  * Criticisms of not recognizing MoL defense
    * May impose liability w/o culpability
    * Muddled w/ MoF - unfair that D required to know law, but not required to know fact in MoF
    * Abundance modern criminal laws, difficult to know them all
    * Proposed 2015 H.R. would reform criminal code to provide broader MoL defense use in federal statute cases where law is silent. Proponents say this is a necessary safeguard against overcriminalization
  
* Circumstances in which MoL has been recognized as a valid defense
  * Specific intent crimes such as:
    * Property Damage - D reasonably believed the property damaged is his own (Smith)
    * Theft - D takes something he subjectively believed that he was entitled to or owned
    * Entrapment - if someone committed an act b/c governmental rep said it was lawful (Raley)
  
* *People v. Marrerro* (1987) (NY CoLR)
  * Facts - D (correction officers) convicted of carrying loaded firearm while off-duty in violation of statute, but D argued good faith MoL that he believed the statute exception for “peace officers” applied to correction officers. Thus, D argues that his mistaken belief about his conduct was founded upon an “official statement” of the law contained in the statute, which wsa reasonable in view of the ambiguous wording of the “peace officer” exemption, and that his “reasonable” interpretation of an “official statement” is sufficient to satisfy statutory requirements for MoL defense
  * Holding - MoL, even good faith, is not a defense. Recognizing misinterpretation of a statute would encourage ignorance of the law
  * DISSENT - “Ignorance of law is no excuse” is antiquated and impossible to follow considering the numerous laws now in existence AND D made “mistaken belief” upon an “official statement” of the statute. Rudovsky think dissent gets it right
  
* *Regina v. Smith* (1974) (England)
  * Facts - D (tenant) convicted of theft for removed wiring he had installed in the wall in violation of statute saying items installed in wall become landlord property, but D argued MoL (thought property was his) so lacked culpability
  * Holding - While MoL is NOT a defense to civil law (i.e. still liable for damage), it is a defense in criminal law because demonstrates lack of culpability

* *Cheek v. United States* (1991) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of failing to file federal income taxes, but D argued MoL b/c he believed taxes were illegal
  * Holding - Whether a good-faith MoL is sufficient to negate intent requirement of willfulness is (i) a question of fact for the jury (ii) and not subject to an objective reasonableness standard. Tax law is complicated and there must be a specific intent to violate that law. The term “willfulness” makes an exception to the rule that mistake of law is not a defense
  * Reasoning - A defendant will satisfy the willfulness requirement if she made a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.” This means that the defendant must (1) know about the duty and (2) purposely violate it. Here it is clear there was no innocent mistake and that a known duty was simply ignored out of disagreement
  
* *Lambert v. California* (1957) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts - D convicted of violating LA statute requiring prior-convicted felons to register, but D argued he had no knowledge of the statute
  * Holding - Due process limitations require that D be shown to know he is violating this law
    * Notice is essential component of due process and is applicable where person is wholly passive and unaware of wrongdoing. Without notice, there is no opportunity to comply and avoid the conduct
  * DISSENT - Many laws are unknown to people to whom the laws apply; Majority draws impossible constitutional line between doing and not doing
