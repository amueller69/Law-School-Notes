# Attempt

## Breakdown of MPC 5.01 - Criminal Attempt

* (1) Definition of Attempt - A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:
  * (a) Purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or
    * *Suggests that reverse mistake of fact may still constitute an attempt.The MPC make clear here that the person’s mens rea is important for establishing attempt, maybe not objectively*
  * (b) When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; or
    * *This captures the traditional "last act" doctrines. If I take all the steps and just miss or fail to carry it out. If the person has done everything needed to commit the crime -- completed actus reus -- they can be found guilty of attempt*
  * (c) Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime
    * *The MPC here incorporates the notion that when something intervenes that prevents the final actus reus, there needs to be a substantial step*
* (2) Conduct Which May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection (1)(c) - Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose. Without negativing the sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:
  * (a) Lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime;
  * (b) Enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission;
  * (c) Reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime;
  * (d) Unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed;
  * (e) Possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;
  * (f) Possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission, where such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances;
  * (g) Soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime.

## Attempt and Mens Rea

* Statutory definitions of the crime of "attempt"
  * "A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such a crime" - NY Penal Law
  * "A person commits the offense of attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step towards the commission of that offense" - IL Comp. Stat
* Punishment
  * Traditionally, an actor who intentionally seeks harm is less punished much less severely if his attempt proves unsuccessful
  * Today, usual punishment for attempt is a reduced factor of the punishment for the completed crime
    * At common law, attempts were misdemeanors
    * In CA, attempt carries a maximum term of half that of the maximum term of the completed offense
  * Justifications for less severe punishment
    * Retributive - Severity of punishment depends on the relationship to the level of harm. Under just deserts, no reason to punish as severely if there is no harm to avenge
  * This might be a problem, considering the the level of culpability an attempt carries is nearly identical to that of successful completion
    * "In one sense, each has committed an offense, but the one has had the bad luck to cause a horrible misfortune..Both certainly deserve punishment, but it gratifies a natural public feeling to choose out for punishment the one who actually has caused great harm"
  * "The principle of proportionality does not decree that the degree of punishment be proportionate to the offender's good or bad luck, but rather to his...blameworthiness"
* Specific Intent
  * General common law rule and most American statutes hold that an attempt requires **a purpose or specific intent** to produce the proscribed result, even when recklessness or some lesser mens rea would suffice for conviction of the completed offense
  * What does specific intent mean? Under MPC, it exists only when it is the actors "conscious object...to cause such a result"
    * MPC 5.01 - "Required mens rea is satisfied if defendant acts with purpose of causing or with the belief that his conduct will cause the prohibited result"
  * Why should attempt require higher mens rea than required to convict of the actual attempt:
    1. Linguistic - Meaning of the word attempt is to accomplish something and it cannot be said to try if one does not intend to succeed
    1. Moral - One who intends to commit a criminal harm does a greater moral wrong than one who merely does so recklessly or negligently
    1. Utilitarian - Importance of the intent is not to show that act was wicked, but that it was likely to be followed by hurtful consequences
  * If we were to extend this to reckless and negligent conduct, it would be difficult to draw a line between culpable and non-culpable conduct
    * Would speeding motorists necessarily be charged of attempted negligent homicide every time the are cited with a speeding violation?
  * Attempted manslaughter
    * Clearly no such thing as intentional involuntary manslaughter (an unintentional killing by definition), but overwhelming weight of case law recognizes offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter (i.e. failed provoked killing)
  * Attempted felony murder
    * Most courts have rejected this. Felony murder is a strict liability offense which is triggered by the outcome, regardless of the mens rea. In the absence of this outcome (i.e. the killing, ), there is nothing to be strictly liable for
  * Statutory Rape - MA court held D guilty for attempted statutory rape for attempting to sleep with someone he believed was 16
    * This finding is clearly inappropriate. There was no harm done (actus reus) or intent to rape (menus rea). Statutory rape is purely strict liability and the outcome that triggers liability never occurred

### *Smallwood v. State* (1996)

* Facts - D (HIV-positive) convicted of attempted murder for unprotected sex with multiple victims despite knowing his HIV status. D argued that attempted murder charge was improper because lacked intent to kill
* Holding - D's conviction was overturned
  * The **required intent in assault with intent to murder is the specific intent to murder**, i.e., the specific intent to kill under circumstances that would not legally justify or mitigate to manslaughter
  * **Only properly guilty if there was sufficient evidence from which trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that D possessed a specific intent to kill at the time he assaulted the women**
    * Intent to kill may be proved by circumstantial evidence; we can **infer that one intends the natural and probable consequences of his act** (e.g. inferred from the use of a deadly weapon direct at a vital part of the human body - risk of killing becomes so high it is reasonable to assume intent was to kill)
  * Here, court holds that it can't be fairly concluded that death by AIDS was sufficiently probably to support inference that D intended to kill. **In the absence of such evidence from which to infer intent to kill, conviction for attempted murder with intent to murder must be reversed**

### Mens Rea Hypothetical
  
* Setup: D places a bomb in a room intending to kill person X. He has good reason to believe that other people would be in the room. If the bomb goes off, assume the law suggests that he would get first-degree murder of X and probably third degree murder of everyone else due to extreme recklessness. The bomb does not go off. You’re charged with attempted murder of everyone in the room, person X, Y, and Z. When it comes to X, there’s probably no issue charging attempted murder because there’s specific intent to kill the victim and done everything – completed attempted. But you’re also charged with attempted murder of Y and Z
* Question: How would this fare both under the common law and MPC?
  * In the common law (see Smallwood) you can’t have an attempt unless you specifically intended to kill specific people
  * Under the MPC, you’re probably guilty of attempted murder even though you didn’t intend to kill Y and Z. Here, the intended mens rea is satisfied for all parties since D acted with the belief that his conduct would cause the prohibited result (i.e. that if the bomb exploded, Y an Z would die as well)
    * The code follows it’s own philosophy – find the mens rea. If it’s enough to satisfy mens rea in completed crime, it’s enough to satisfy it in attempt. This challenges the traditional notion that attempt is meaningfully different than the successful actus rea

## Preparation vs. Attempt

* Common law has recognized between acts which are and are not too remote to constitute criminal attempt
  * How far back should we punish an attempt? The doctrine of conspiracy basically means that if you talk and plan about a crime with others, you can be punished. But if you’re acting outside of the conspiracy sphere, what’s the dividing line
  * Modern law also contains several instances in which mere preparation is considered criminal
    * Example: Demonstrating the use of a firearm intending that the same will be unlawfully used in furtherance of civil disorder
    * Example: Possession with intent to distribute
* If criminal intent is there and D is mentally culpable, why should it matter how far D has gotten in effectuating criminal purpose?
  * Locus penitentiae - The opportunity to report and/or change one's mind
    * If the threshold is too low and D is preempted, we may hold them guilty of attempt when we really don't know if they would have gone through with it
    * If D abandoned criminal plan and is subsequently arrested, we would be holding them guilty even if they took every effort to prevent causing any harm (See Abandonment section below for how some jurisdictions address this problem)
  * Punishment of thought crimes
    * Don't want to punish people for merely thinking about committing crime
* Abandonment - Once a D has moved from mere preparation to attempt, can he abandon his attempt and escape liability? No. Although there is disagreement on the matter, most scholars believe that abandonment is not a common law defense to attempt.
  * To the extent that a defense of abandonment is recognized today, however, it applies **only if the defendant voluntary and completely renounces her criminal purpose**. It has to be a genuine change of heart – can’t just abandon your attempt because the plan is falling apart or because the risk of capture is higher or you’re afraid of the police
  * The MPC recognizes this approach of voluntary and complete renunciation, even if a substantial step is taken to make an act an attempt. But it too has to be genuine

### Tests for Distinguishing Preparation from Attempt

* **Final Step Test** (Has pretty much been universally rejected)
  * Traditional theory that effectively that precludes incomplete acts from criminal attempt. A criminal attempt only occurred when the person performed all of the acts that she believed were necessary to commit the target offense
    * Someone who has stopped short of this, either out of repentance/intervention or because time has not yet come, they are still within scope of innocent preparation
    * Example: Attempted murder by shooting does not occur until D pulls the trigger
  * This test really frustrates prevention efforts by law enforcement

* **Unequivocally Test / Res Ipsa Loquitur Test**
  * Doesn't look at how far D has gone in his conduct, but instead at how clearly his acts bespeak his intent
  * An act does not constitute an attempt until it becomes unequivocal. That is, **an attempt occurs when a person’s conduct, standing alone, unambiguously manifests her criminal intent**
    * Must demonstrate that the crime is about to be committed unless frustrated by intervention
  * Some jurisdictions have adopted this approach (e.g. SD, WI)
    * Criticisms include that it allows D to mask his intent in order to avoid conviction of attempt if unsuccessful

* **Proximity to Danger Test** (*Rizzo*)
  * In drawing line between preparation and attempt, **must only consider those acts which are so to the accomplishment of a crime that, in all reasonable probability, the crime itself would have been successfully completed but for timely intervention**
  * A person is guilty of an attempt when her conduct is in “dangerous proximity to success” or when an act “is so near to the result that the danger of success if very great”
  * Justice Holmes dissenting in *Hyde* - "There must be dangerous proximity to success"
  * Consider the distance/gap between D's actions and the unachieved goal of the consummated crime - the distance must be relatively short and the gap narrow if D is to be held guilty of attempt

* **Substantial Step Test** (MPC Approach)
  * Roughly half of states and 2/3rd of federal circuits employ some type of substantial step test
  * **In addition to criminal purpose, an act must be a substantial step in a course of conduct designed to accomplish a criminal result and that it be strongly corroborative of criminal purpose in order for it to constitute such a substantial step**
  * Distinguished from other approaches
    * Unlike proximity, it doesn't matter what remains to be done - what matters is what you’ve done. Fact that further major steps must be taken isn't prelcusive. If you’ve taken a substantial step toward the crime, that’s enough to corroborate mens rea
      * *Rizzo* would probably be convicted under this approach
    * Does not require finding as to whether actor would have desisted prior to completing crime
    * Requirement of proving a substantial step is less of a hurdle for prosecutors than unequivocality test
    * Not requiring last proximate act would allow apprehension earlier on without immunizing D from criminal liability for attempt

### *King v. Barker* (1924 New Zealand)

* Summary: Court rejects rule where in order to constitute criminal attempt, D must have taken the last stp which he was able to tke along the road of his criminal intent (in other words, D must have done all he intended to do for the purpose of effectuating his criminal intent). Court argues that proper dividing line between preparation and attempt is to be found between two extremes (first step and final act)
  
### *People v. Rizzo* (1927 NY CoA)

* Facts: Four armed men drove around looking for V, whom the expected would be withdrawing large sums of money from the bank. They entered various buildings, but two police officers arrested them before they could find V
* Rule: **The act or acts must come or advance very near to the accomplishment of the intended crime in order to constitute an attempt**
* Holding: The court overturned the attempted robbery charges because Ds weren’t dangerously close to success since V was nowhere to be found. The opportunity to commit the crime never came. We wouldn't charge someone with attempted murder if he set out to kill but couldn't find the victim
  
### *McQuirter v. State* (1953 AL CoA)
  
* Facts - D, black man, convicted of attempted assault for following a white woman around based on confession to police, although D claims he wasn’t following her at all. D convicted of attempted assault.
* Holding - Intent is a question of fact for the jury to decide based on facts/circumstances and social customs based on race. Conviction of attempted assault affirmed
  
### *United States v. Jackson* (1977 2d)

* Facts: D’s planned to rob a bank but aborted first attempt because the bank was too crowded. D’s returned days later and FBI agents arrested D’s while driving towards the bank in a car filled w/ guns and supplies. D’s convicted of attempted robbery
* Rule: In order to convict of attempt, **acts must constitute a substantial step and corroborate criminal purpose**
* Holding: Convictions affirmed. D's were seriously dedicated to commission of a crime and passed stage beyond preparation. Would have assaulted bank had they not been dissuaded by other factors. Either type of conduct alone is a substantial step under MPC and corroborated their criminal purpose
  
### *US v. Harper* (1994 9th Cir.)

* Facts: ATM bill trap case. D's purposely cause ATM to malfunction so they can rob it when repair man shows up. While waiting, they are apprehended by police and charged with attempted robbery
* Rule: **Must take a step of such substantiality that, unless frustrate, the crime would have occurred**
* Holding: Convictions overturned. Necessary stage of crime had not been entered. Major difference between causing something that will result in the appearance of a potential victim (ATM repairman) and actual moving towards victim with gun and mask
  * Would MPC follow? I don't think so. Luring and waiting for person against which crime would be committed are each "substantial acts" under the MPC. As is possessing instruments necessary to commit the crime. Seems corroborative of criminal purpose

### *US v. Joyce* (1982 8th Cir.)

* Facts: D negotiating cocaine price but refused to buy the cocaine when he grew suspicious at the sellers reluctance to reveal the contents of the packaging to verify it was cocaine. Seller was actually undercover officer and D was subsequently arrested for attempting to purchase with intent to distribute
* Holding: Conviction overturned. Intention was abandoned prior to commission of substantial step necessary to effectuate the purchase. It was merely a preliminary discussion. Motive for refusing to commit substantial step is irrelevant (doesn't matter if he was tipped off)
* Appropriate application of MPC?
  * Could make an argument that this was solicitation to have seller commit crime and appearing at place are both substantial acts that,when viewed together, are corroborative of criminal purpose

### *United States v. Howard* (2014 5th Cir.)

* Facts: D negotiated sex with minors, told the mother to perform sex acts on them and take birth control in preparation. Failed to book flight
* Holding - Court upholds attempt conviction. D takes substantial step when he instructs preparation for the crime. Definite plan to travel not itself necessary to constitute a substantial step
* Appropriate application of MPC?

## Solicitation

* Solicitation = Inchoate offense of requesting another person commit a target crime
  * Courts differ over question whether solicitation itself constitutes an attempt by the person making it
    * Some states hold solicitor cannot be convicted of attempt because it is not his purpose to commit the offense personally
* **MPC 5.02**
  * (1) D requests, commands, encourages a person to attempt or commit a crime
  * (2) Failed communication is still sufficient for solicitation
  * (3) Withdrawal is defense if D voluntarily thwarts the target crime

### *State v. Davis* (1928 MO)
  
* Facts - D and accomplice planned to kill accomplice’s husband to collect life insurance payment. D asked person (undercover cop) to get ex-convict to kill the husband; D gave person photos of the husband and paid him $600. D convicted of attempted first-degree murder, but D argued no attempt because no overt act toward committing the crime beyond mere preparation
* Holding - **Mere solicitation, unaccompanied by an act directly toward commission of crime, is not overt act constituting attempt**. Evidence only shows verbal arrangement and communication of instructions. These alone are mere acts of preparation. Undercover cop obviously had no intention of following through, nor did he take steps. Thus, no attempt

### *US v. Church* (1991 US Military Court)

* Facts - D hired person (undercover officer) to kill his wife, giving the person details. Person faked killing and D paid him.  D convicted of attempted first-degree murder, but D argued no attempt because no overt act toward committing the crime beyond mere preparation
* Holding - Detailed planning qualifies as overt act towards commission of a crime (court openly rejects holding in *Davis*)
  * Detailed instructions and payment constituted substantial step. Court can't conceive of anything more that D could have done to effectuate his intent aside from committing the murder himself
* NOTE: D’s conviction reduced from attempted first-degree murder to attempted second-degree because no death (CL idea that punishment should be proportionate to resulting harm vs. MPC idea that punishment should be proportionate to D’s culpability)

## Impossibility

* Impossibility is concerned with the question of: What if you attempt a crime, but it’s a literal impossibility that you could complete the attempted crime?
  * Utilitarian/subjective not as concerned if it’s impossible. You have the requisite mens rea, so you should be punished

* **Pure Factual Impossibility** = No defense
  * Under the attendant circumstances, though unaware at the time, there was no way that D could have possibly succeeded in carrying out his intended criminal action. Example: Attempt misfires do to poor aim, inadequate weapon, unloaded gun, etc.
  * Example: D shoots a bed thinking he’s going to kill the victim. Full mens rea, but no one was in the bed. Attempted murder?
    * Yes – this is a factual impossibility. We’ve got full mens rea, full actus reus, and only luck that no one was in the bed. Most states will treat this as attempted murder

* **Pure Legal Impossibility** = Valid defense
  * True legal impossibility - Person engages in activity they believe to be prohibited but no such crime actually exists
  * Example: Same situation, but this time the person is in the bed. D shoots, hits the victim but it turns out the victim had been dead for hours previously. Attempted murder?
    * No – it’s legally impossible to murder a dead person. Though there’s some debate
    * However - you can see how you might be able to spin this into a factual impossibility

* **Hybrid Legal Impossibility** = Usually not a defense - Mislabeled factual impossibility
  * This situation exists if the actor’s goal is illegal, but commission of the offense is impossible due to factual mistake (and not simply a misunderstanding of the law) regarding the legal status of some attendant circumstance that is an element of the charged offense
  * Example - D receives recovered stolen property believing it was stolen
  * What distinguishes these cases from simple ‘factual impossibilities’ however, is that these factual mistakes relate to legal status of the defendant’s conduct
  * Ultimately, hybrid legal impossibility cases may be reasonably be characterized as factual impossibility…
    * For example, if D shoots a corpse believing it to be human, D would say it’s legal impossibility – you can’t murder a dead person
  * MPC approach has influenced the debate – If the factual circumstances had been as D believed – that the victim had been alive – he would be guilty of murder
  * Most states have abolished hybrid legal impossibility on the grounds that it sure looks like factual impossibility. Objectivists/retributionists say that if something is legally impossible, there’s no actual harm to society – subjectivists who care about mens rea disagree – these are people with malicious intent that are dangerous to society

### *People v. Jaffe* (NY 1906)

* Facts - The Defendant sought to purchase what he believed was stolen property – twenty yards of cloth. In fact, the property had lost its character as “stolen” by the time it was offered to Defendant for purchase, having been restored to its rightful owner and made available to him through their agency. Though Defendant believed he was purchasing stolen property, his belief was in error. D charged with crime is receiving stolen property
* Issue - Improper to convict of attempted stolen property?
  * Defense argues that this was a legal impossibility – there is no crime of possessing non-stolen property (although you could argue it’s factual impossibility, is it stolen or not)
* Holding - Conviction overturned
  * Court distinguishes this from pickpocket cases in which it is not necessary for there to be something valuable in pocket to be subject to larceny. The pickpocket cases are frustrated only be the fact that there’s no money in the pocket. The frustration here is the property turns out not be stolen. The latter would not have been a crime if successfully consummated, hence it was legally impossible
    * This is factual v. legal impossibility
    * However, couldn’t the State say that this is just like the pickpocket? In the same way that there was no money in the pocket, these were not stolen
      * One could argue that there’s no distinction between this and factual impossibility, which is not a defense
    * The court looks at whether the attendant circumstance is really a stolen property. It’s a legal status question

### *People v Dlugash* (1977 NY)

* Facts: Man shoots victim in the chest a few times. A few minutes later, the Defendant shoots the victim in the chest and head again. The man is convicted of attempted murder because it was unknown whether or not the victim was alive at the time the Defendant shot him. If he was dead, then an attempted murder charge would be bogus – matter of impossibility. If he was alive, he could be convicted of murder / attempted murder. The facts are heavily disputed
* Issue: We know that there’s full mens rea, but the question is whether there is attempt?
* Court recognizes general rule that legal impossibility is a valid defense whereas factual impossibility isn't
* Court adopts **MPC** approach - **It is an attempt if the crime would have occurred if the attendant circumstances were as you thought them to be**. Virtually eliminates any impossibility defense - **legal or factual impossibility under attendant circumstances are irrelevant if D intentionally engages in conduct tending to effect commission of crime**
* Under MPC standard, there is sufficient evidence in record from which jury could conclude that D believed V was still alive, it is irrelevant whether V was still alive as a matter of fact at the time D fired the shots

### *United States v Berrigan* (1973 3rd Cir.)

* Facts - Father Berrigan was imprisoned for being a Vietnam War resister. A federal statute made it a crime to send and receive letters in prison without the warden’s consent. Father Berrigan was doing just that, thinking that he was acting in violation of the warden’s consent. In reality, the warden knew the whole time and allowed the letters to go through
* Issue: Any basis for an attempt charge?
  * Berrigan argues that I cannot be guilty of this crime because the warden knew about it. That’s right, but the state argues that it’s an attempt
* Holding - No attempt, this is a legal impossibility because “Legal impossibility is said to occur where the intended acts, even if completed, would not amount to a crime. Thus, legal impossibility would apply to those circumstances where (1) the motive, desire, and expectation is to perform an act in violation of the law; (2) there is intention to perform a physical act; (3) there is a performance of the intended physical act; and (4) the consequence resulting from the intended act does not amount to a crime”:

### *United States v Ovideo* (5th Cir. 1976)

* Facts: Drug dealer was contacted by an undercover agent for the sale of heroin. It turns out the sale was of fake heroin and the dealer was arrested for attempted sale. On appeal, the court vacated the conviction
* Holding: The court chose to reject the distinction of legal impossibility and factual impossibility because the court didn’t think they helped. Technically you could convict here under a factual impossibility standard (i.e. it didn’t matter that it was fake) but not under legal impossibility. The court also rejects the MPC approach because it amounts to prosecuting mere thoughts
  * “Thus, we demand that in order for a defendant to be guilty of a criminal attempt, the objective acts performed, without any reliance on the accompanying mens rea, mark the defendant’s conduct as criminal in nature”
* Related Hypothetical
  * Setup: Two hunters both kill deer on Oct. 15. It turns out that hunting is permitted on that day. It is illegal to hunt before Oct. 1st. One of them thought it was Sept 15, thinks he’s acting illegally. One way to think about it is that he’s just wrong about the attendant circumstances, the facts. The other person knows it’s Oct. 15, but think it’s only permissible in November. This seems to be legal mistake/legal impossibility
  * One is clearly factual impossibility and other is legal impossibility. Yet, under the doctrines, the first person would be punished, but not the second. Why do we distinguish? The situation seems to be the exact same thing, the same wrong
    * Perhaps this is why the MPC approach is better – which would consistently hold them both culpable because of their mens rea
