# The Criminal Justice System, The Process Of Proof, and Punishment

## Introduction

### The Sweep Of Criminal Law In America

* Overview:
  * America has the largest penal system in the world with staggeringly high percentages of people
  incarcerated.
  * Over 2.3 million people are incarcerated in the US and the US has about 25% of the world’s incarcerated people despite having only about 5% of the worlds population. There are about another 2 million people on parole These numbers are exceptionally high, especially for a democracy.
  * There is both over enforcement and under enforcement. Some argue that minority communities are affected worse by under enforcement as communities are not protected from repeated violations of their rights. Criminals know that there are some crimes which they will not be arrested for and victims have their rights systematically violated by offenders who know the police will not come after them (Specifically domestic violence in minority communities is not prosecuted often)

* Social and Racial Concentration:
  * Black people make up about half of the population of incarcerated people despite being 13% of the population.
  * More than 20% of black men born since 1960 have been incarcerated for at least a year on a felony conviction.
  * Minorities receive harsher prison sentences than whites for the same crime.
  * David Garland writes that the US has mass imprisonment, which means that the US penal system has a heavy concentration on specific groups (i.e. minorities)

* Causes:
  * Despite crime rates dropping during the 1990’s incarceration rates are still high. One of theories is that legislators want incarceration to increase because they see it as the proper solution to a crime (i.e. Mandatory minimum sentencing for certain crimes guarantees jail time for some offenses)
  * US gives to primary to convictions over rehab for drug and alcohol offenses

### The Structure Of Criminal Justice The Relevant Institutional Actors

* Heavy volumes of cases and limited resources (personnel) create a system of mass production in the US penal system. The justice system is supposed to provide individualized responses to crime, but these two factors create a system where sentences are churned out factory style, often unfair to the perpetrator.
* Police officers often have discretion which crimes they will arrest people for and which groups of people they will target. Similarly, the DA’s office chooses who to prosecute and for what sentence. This creates a high degree of subjectiveness in a process that not should have any.
* The election of judges, DA’s, and other positions imbue the US penal system with the issue that these people will take voter reactions into consideration when making decisions leaving the system susceptible to short term emotionalism and issues of politics.

* Multiple Jurisdictions:
  * Criminal justice authority is dispersed throughout different levels. There are state forces (state troopers), many cities have independent police agencies with specialized missions (transit police, housing police), and most cities and states have independent prosecuting attorneys with specialized mandates ( a city department for municipal code enforcement, a state attorney general’s office). Alongside all of this there’s is the independent engine of federal law enforcement.. In this system there are multiple levels as well with multiple agencies, such as the DEA and SEC.
  * The criminal justice system is extremely decentralized. Some people describe the overlapping authorities of the police as chaotic and irrational.

* Police:
  * Decide who gets arrested. Crimes are, to an extent, defined by the police officer. He has discretion to either arrest or warn people violation laws.

* Prosecutors:
  * The decision to send a case to trial based on sufficient evidence is made by the prosecutor.
  * Needs all of his decisions to take a case to trial approved by a judge or grand jury, which they almost always are due to the low level of proof required
  * Has enormous power. Can either take a case to trial or drop a case, can ask for harsh or less harsh punishments.

* Defense Counsel: Only about 20% of defendants can afford their own attorneys
  * Non-indigent defendants: When people can afford to pay their own attorneys, often in massive lump some payments of thousands of dollars at a time. Attorney is paid regardless of whether the defendant accepts a guilty plea right away or goes to a lengthy trial.
  * Indigent defendants: Court picks the attorney for the defendant who then accepts or proceeds without counsel. This appointed counsel system means the court appoints the counsel from a private firm who usually gets paid but not beyond a pre-determined maximum. In contract system a lawyer or group of lawyers accepts payment from the government in exchange for representing clients. In defender systems the city has set up an office to deal with cases with counsel on payroll who then are not under constraints of the other systems to get cases over with quickly.

* Judges:
  * Most judges are elected by popular elections, some are appointed

* Corrections:
  * Goal of the system is no longer to correct, more to restrain and restrict

## Presentation of Evidence

* **The Order of Proof**:
  * First, the prosecution calls witnesses in an effort to prove the elements of the offense charged. Case may fail if they fail to meet the burden of proof.
  * If the prosecution does not fail, then the defense calls witnesses to refute the prosecutions case in chief to establish some **affirmative defense**. Defense can recall or call new witnesses for purpose of rebuttal. Defense is afforded a chance to answer by **rejoinder** any matters introduced in the prosecutors rebuttal.
  * Witnesses are first examined by the party that called them (direct examination) and afterward by the opposing party (cross examination). Further questioning is re-direct and re-cross.

* **Relevance**: Evidence is relevant for the purposes of the rules of evidence **only if it is both probative and material**. Evidence is probative only if it tends to establish the proposition for which it is offered or – to be precise – the proposition is more likely to be true given the evidence than it would be without the evidence. Probative is generally enough to be admissible, but if the evidence is not material is could be excluded.
  * Irrelevant evidence is never admissible
  * Relevant evidence is generally admissible


* **Exclusionary Rule: Privilege**
  * Sometimes relevant evidence cannot be admissible. Rules relating to privilege allow people to withhold certain types of testimony in order to protect certain interests.
  * One of the most important privileges is the privilege against self-incrimination (5th Amendment)

* **Exclusionary Rule: Prejudice**
  * Evidence must be excluded when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. **Evidence is prejudicial when it will affect the result in an improper way**. Thus, prejudice is involved if the jury is likely to overestimate the probative value of the evidence or if the evidence will arouse undue hostility toward one of the parties
    * Prejudice is read narrowly because theoretically everything is prejudicial.
    * The defendant should not have to prove his character when he is on trial, he only has to try try and prove his character and defend past transgressions as well as it would use of valuable court resources (See *Zackowitz*)
  
### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 401

> Evidence is relevant if (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence AND (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 402

> Relevant evidence is admissible unless [otherwise provided]. Irrelevant evidence is not permissible.

### *People v. Zackowitz* (1930 NY)

* Background: Case where prosecutor brought up prejudicial evidence of defendant character
* Facts: Zackowitz and his wife were walking down a street when four men, one of which was the victim Frank Coppola, made insulting remarks to Zackowitz’s wife that caused her to cry. Upon finding out what the four men said Zackowitz returned to where his wife was berated and a fight broke out. Zackowitz shot and Coppola. Zackowitz admitted to the crime, the issue here is the degree of murder he will be charged with. This hinged on whether the murder was premeditated or done in the heat of the moment. Prosecution brought up facts about Zackowitz’s character, calling him of murderous disposition in an attempt to get him convicted of the highest degree of murder by making premeditated seem more likely.
* Rule: **Cannot bring up aspects of a defendants character unless the defendant brings them up first. It’s impermissible to bring up prior convictions. One should be on trial for the crime they committed, not previous offenses.**
Holding: Zackowitz never brought up his character so when the prosecution did they imbued the jury with prejudice and therefore could not appropriately make determinations about Zackowitz’s state of mind without being prejudice.

* Related Hypotheticals From Class
  * Poor person from PA, prosecutor states that the person is more likely to steal because he is poor.
    * Is this argument allowed? **No**, it’s prejudicial despite being relevant.
  * Person is a gambling addict who owes a lot of money. Money is embezzled. Prosecutor tries to
  use gambling tendencies show he was the thief.
    * Is it allowed? *No*, its prejudicial despite being relevant.

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 403

> The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or no needlessly presenting cumulative defense.

### Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 404

> Crimes, Wrongs, or Other Acts… Evidence of a crime wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a persons character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character … This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

* Exceptions to the Rule of Prejudice:
* The rule against admitting other-crimes evidence is subject to a number of exceptions. (i.e. Evidence that the defendant stole the pistol used in the murder could be admissible to identify the defendant as the killer). Also can be used to show motive (i.e. if the victim was a witness to a previous crime committed by the defendant, this could show motive for murder)
* If the defendant chooses to testify in his own defense, then the prosecution can bring up prior crimes that he committed
* Sex Offense Cases: Evidence of prior crimes is allowed with sex offenses - Fed. Rule of Evidence 413(a)
* The same goes for child molestation cases, previous criminal acts are admissible as evidence – Fed. Rule of Evidence 414(a)
* However, these two exceptions must still pass 403, which means they must be more probative than prejudicial.

## Burden Of Proof

### MPC Section 1.12 – Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt; Affirmative Defenses; Burden of Proving Fact When Not an Element of an Offense; Presumptions

* (1) No person may be convicted of an offense unless each element of such offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of such proof, the innocence of the defendant is assumed
* (2) Subsection (1) of this Section does not:
  * Require the disproof of an affirmative defense unless and until there is evidence supporting such defense; or
  * Apply to any defense which the Code or another statute plainly requires the defendant to prove by a preponderance of evidence
* (3) A ground of defense is affirmative, within the meaning of Subsection (2)(a) of this
Section, when
  * It arises under a section of the Code which so provides; or
  * It relates to an offense defined by a statute other than the Code and statute so provides; or
  * It involves a matter of excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence
* (4) When the application of the Code depends upon the finding of a fact which is not an element of an offense, unless the Code otherwise provides
  * The burden of proving the fact is on the prosecution or defendant, depending on whose interest or contention will be furthered if the finding should be made; and
  * The fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court or jury, as the case may be
* (5) When the Code establishes a presumption with respect to any fact which is an element of an offense, it has the following consequences
  * When there is evidence of the facts which give rise to the presumption, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury, unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negatives the presumed fact; and
  * When the issue of the existence of the presumed fact is submitted to the jury, the court shall charge that while the presumed fact must, on all the evidence, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the law declares that the jury may regard the facts giving rise to the presumption as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact
* (6) Presumption not established by the Code or inconsistent with it has the consequences otherwise accorded it by law.

### *In Re Winship* (1970 SCOTUS)

* Facts: Defendant, a minor, was charged with committing acts, that if performed by an adult would constitute larceny. Defendant was found by a preponderance of the evidence to be guilty
* Holding: **Must use beyond a reasonable doubt standard when pursing a criminal case**. Social disutility, it is incredibly important to not convict an innocent man, it is more important than letting a guilty man walk free
* Notes:
  * McCullough v. State: Judge gave instruction on a scale of 1-10m to determine guilt. Supreme Court overruled stating that **beyond a reasonable doubt is supposed to be qualitative**. Making it quantitative could lower or increase the burden of proof

### *United States v. Dougherty* (1972 DC Circuit)

* Facts: Appellants broke into Dow Chemical plant. Appellants claim the lower level judge did not instruct the jury on jury nullification and claim the jury should have known that they can throw out the case regardless of the law
* Holding: Court has **no obligation to instruct jury on jury nullification**. Doing so would be too burdensome on the courts and runs the **risk of jurors taking the law into their own hands**.
* Concurrence/Dissent (Bazelon): If we want the jurors to know of the power of jury nullification it should be instructed to them. Jury nullification is a necessary counter to case-hardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors
* Notes
  * Many examples of pros and cons to jury nullification in the notes following Dougherty
  * Judges can get rid of jurors if it can be unambiguously proven that they intended to give a certain verdict regardless of the evidence and trial (US v. Thomas, juror should not have been thrown out because his intentions were unclear)
  * FIJA (organization that spreads awareness of jury nullification) often gets charged with jury tampering and other charges for trying to spread the idea of jury nullification. This contradicts the idea in Daugherty, that courts should instruct juries on jury nullification rather they should get info about jury nullification from other sources.

## Punishment

### MPC §1.02. Purposes; Principles of Construction (Attempting to Codify Why We Punish)

* (1) The general purposes of the provision governing the definition of offenses are:
  * To forbid and prevent conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests;
  * To subject to public control persons whose conduct indicates that they are disposed to commit crimes;
  * To safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal;
  * To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense
  * To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses
* (2) The general purposes of the provisions governing the sentencing and treatment of offenders are:
  * To prevent the commission of offenses;
    * To promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders;
  * To safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment;
  * To give fair warning of the nature of the sentences that may be imposed on conviction of an offense
  * To differentiate among offenders with a view to a just individualization in their treatment;
  * To define, coordinate and harmonize the powers, duties and functions of the courts and of administrative officers and agencies responsible for dealing with offenders
  * To advance the use of generally accepted scientific methods and knowledge in the sentencing and treatment of offenders
  * To integrate responsibility for the administrative of the correctional system in a State Department of Correction
* (3) The provisions of the Code shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purpose stated in this Section and the special purposes of the particular provision involved. The discretionary powers conferred by the Code shall be exercised in accordance with the criteria stated in the Code and, insofar as such criteria are not decisive, to further the general purposes stated in this Section.

### Richard A. Wright, Prisons: Prisoners, Encyclopedia Of Crime and Justice

* Punishment can be a fine, probation, imprisonment, death penalty, etc.
* The conviction itself is a form of punishment, it is an impediment to attaining jobs afterwards, can make future sentences worse, etc.
* Some jurisdictions have intermediate sanctions that are worse than probation, but not as bad as imprisonment (i.e. home detention, mandatory community service)
* Maximum security prisons are the most extreme type of prison. Although, all prisons breed a feeling of hopelessness within their inmates. Many gangs form in prison and those gangs are let loose on the streets when those prisoners are paroled. Many just hope to survive prison
* The general idea is that violence within prisons is underreported
* Prisons are incredibly overcrowded with many operating above their maximum capacity
* Suicide rates are higher in prison
* Incarceration without imprisonment: These are not technically prisons so they are not held to the
same safeguards that prisons are

### Civil Sanctions

* These types of sanctions do not have the same constitutional protections as imprisonment
* Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill is generally seen as a civil matter. They have a right
to treatment and when they are treated they must be released . However, if they are never fully
cured they could be confined for life.
* Registering of sex offenders is another type of civil sanction. Some states impose no limits on
the public disclosure of information of ex-offenders.
THEORIES OF PUNISHMENT (89-108, 113-116, 118-119, 122-124, 128-132)

### Theories of Punishment

* In General:
  * Punishment is intended to be unpleasant (unlike paying taxes, military service during wartime)
  * Why we punish generally falls into two categories, utilitarian and retributive

* **Utilitarian** – Consequentialist school of ethics prescribing actions that maximize social utility - essentially a cost-benefit analysis from the punishment (i.e. deterrence). Punishment should serve some additional purpose
  * Some of these additional purposes are deterrence, incapacitation of dangerous people, rehabilitation
  * Specific Deterrence: Deterring the specific person who committed the crime
  * General Deterrence: Deterring the general population from committing the crime
  * > “The general object which all laws have, or ought to have, in common, is to augment the total happiness of the community; and therefore, in the first place, to exclude, as far as may be, every thing that tends to subtract from the happiness: in other words to exclude mischief. But all punishment is mischief: all punishment in itself is evil. Upon the principle of utility, if it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only be admitted in as far as it promise to exclude some greater evil - Jeremy Bentham"
  * Issues with Utilitarian View: Can require extremely severe punishments that would be disproportionate to a defendants blameworthiness, merely because those punishments produce other beneficial consequence for society. Conversely, it can produce too lenient of a sentence for a harsh crime if the perpetrator is not likely to commit the crime again.

* Retribution - “A retributivist punishes because, and only because, the offender deserves it" Many types of retributive punishments, but all focus on the idea that the punishment must be justified by the seriousness of the offense committed
  * **Positive Retributivism**: Society must punish the blameworthy with equivalent severity to the seriousness of the crime
  * **Negative Retributivism**: The seriousness of the crime sets the upper limit of the punishment, but it is not mandated that the perpetrator get that maximum punishment
  * Issues with Retribution: Can call for punishments that do much more harm than good (i.e. requiring a perpetrator to go to jail which forces his children into foster care). It can also give out a just penalty to an offender, but that punishment might not deter him from performing the crime again.

* Cousins Of Retribution
  * **Retaliation and Vengeance**: Punishment stamps the perpetrator with a mark of indignation for life. Follows the idea that one can hate the perpetrator

* Mixed Theories – Punishments purpose is utilitarian: to reduce crime and thus protect the rights of all to be secure in their persons and property. But that purpose must be pursued within retribution [just deserts] limits. Thus a person can legitimately be punished only if he committed a crime, only in proportion to that crime, and only if doing so would produce a world with less crime" This approach bars disproportionate punishment, even if a cost-benefit calculus supports it, but it also bars punishment that is perfectly proportionate to an offender’s blame if that punishment would not be socially beneficial under all circumstances

## Sentencing

* Overview:
  * In response to aggravation with judge discretion in regards to sentencing, there have been several reforms including mandatory minimums and three strikes in and your out
  * This essentially takes the power of discretion away from the judge and gives it to the prosecutor
* Mandatory Minimums:
* Sentences that judges have to give out if a crime is committed (Ex. The Fighter case). Very common in drug related crimes.
* The original goal was eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, however racial disparities have increased with the proliferation of mandatory minimums

### *United States v. Vazquez* (2010 NY)

Vazquez was a part but not a huge part of his brother’s drug dealing empire. When Vazquez was caught he cooperated with law enforcement and gave them names. Most people agree that what Vazquez was doing was not worthy of the 5 year mandatory minimum, but the US attorney’s office wouldn’t budge on the number and Vazquez is convicted and sentenced the mandatory minimum, which adversely affects him, his 3 year old daughter, and the rest of his family. The mandatory minimum treats all people the same from low-level people in drug empires to the drug lords themselves, if they are found with a certain amount of drugs on them theny they are going to get the mandatory minimum most likely, even though it is unjust on occasions for people who are not as involved as they higher up people in the drug empire

### Three Strikes

* If a person commits several offenses and is convicted of those crimes, then in some jurisdictions the three strike policy gives the perpetrator 25 to life
* Punishes repeat offenders and gets them off the street.
* Clearly prior imprisonment has neither deterred nor rehabilitated these types of offenders, so the three strike policy puts them away likely for good
* Is it grossly disproportionate? If it is the third offense, a person can get 25 to life for stealing a candy bar. It that just?

### *Ewing v. California* (2003)

* Facts: Ewing was convicted of several serious felonies in his past. Ranging from burglary to possession of drug paraphernalia, Ewing previously spent time in prison and on parole for several serious offenses. Ewing then was convicted of larceny again when he stole golf clubs. Due to California’s three strike rule, Ewing was sentenced to 25 to life.
* Question: Does the three strike rule violate the constitutions 8th amendment?
* Holding: No. Since traditional forms of deterrence have not worked for a career criminal like Ewing, 25 to life is not cruel and unusual, even though he only stole golf clubs. The 8th amendment protects against grossly unfair punishments. For repeat offenders of serious crimes like Ewing, 25 to life is not cruel and unusual. The 8th amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.
* Dissent (Breyer and others): 25 to life is grossly disproportional for stealing golf clubs

### *Graham V Florida* (2010)

* Facts: Graham, a minor, was arrested for breaking into a home while on probation for another robbery. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
* Question: Is life in prison to a minor for a non-homicidal offense constitutional?
* Holding: No, **it violates the 8th Amendment by being a grossly disproportionate sentence**. Imprisonment for life without parole is similar to the death sentence. Especially since this is a non-homicidal case, LWOP for a minor is grossly disproportionate.
* Concurrence (Roberts): Judges must use discretion when handling cases and consider the fact the defendant is a juvenile who are less culpable than adults.
* Dissent (Thomas): Decision that LWOP in this case is unconstitutional is should not be up to the decision of the courts.
