# Exculpation

* 3 distinct sorts of defenses can be invoked to bar conviction for an alleged crime:
  1. Assertion that prosecution has failed to establish one or more required elements of the offense
  1. Justification - Affirmative defense that D acted properly
  1. Excuse - Affirmative defense that while the act is not condoned, D’s responsibility is mitigated
* Justification and excuse are different from the first insofar as they don't seek to refute any require element of prosecution's case; rather they suggest considerations that negate liability even when all elements are present

## Justification - Self Defense

* When the use of defensive force against an aggressor is necessary to protect the actor from seriously bodily harm, that action is justified - it was the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances
  * However, court in *Peterson* states widely accepted view that it **isn't required that use of force be truly necessary**; it is available when the **actor reasonably believes defensive force to be necessary**
  * If it turns out that force wasn't truly necessary and reasonable belief was false, then it is more precise to say that the actor is excused; the action was not right, but the mistake was reasonable. Regardless of the label (usually labeled as a justification), one who satisfies the self-defense requirement is entitled to acquittal

* **MPC 3.04**
  * (1) Force justifiable if D subjectively believes it is “immediately necessary for purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force”
  * (2)
    * (a) Force is NOT justifiable if:
      * (i) D knowingly resists lawful arrest
      * (ii) D knowingly resists force of person protecting their property
    * (b) Use of **deadly** force is only justifiable if actor believes force is necessary to protect against death/serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or forced sexual intercourse. It is also unjustified if:
      * (i) Actor provoked the use of force against him in the same encounter with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm (i.e. is the initial aggressor)
      * (ii) Actor knows he can avoid necessity of using such force with safety by retreating, surrendering property, or complying with demands that he abstain from some action. Exceptions:
        * (1) Not obliged to retreat from dwelling or place of work unless he was initial aggressor or is assailed by co-worker
    * (c) Other than in subsections (a) and (b), person using protective force may estimate its necessity under the circumstances as he believes them to be without surrender or retreat
  
* **Battered Women's Syndrome**
  * Different subcultures of violence between the sexes. When women do kill, it frequently targeted towards an abusive spouse or partner. In these cases, it is not uncommon for D to assert defense of self-defense on the basis of history of physical and mental abuse and the associated trauma
  * We see this in two forms
    * Confrontational homicides - Woman kills partner amidst battering incident. This is most common and primary issue becomes whether D is entitled to introduce history of abuse evidence and expert testimony
    * Non-confrontational homicides - Battered woman kills abuser in his sleep. Here the issues are related to (1) the imminent threat requirement and whether D is entitled to jury instruction on self defense absent some aggressive act by the abuser; and (2) can BWS evidence and testimony be introduced to show that D reasonably subjectively believed such actions were necessary to combat imminent deadly assault. Courts are divided here
    * Evidence of prior abuse not ordinarily allowed - the victim is not the one on trial and it improperly focuses jury in his character. However, it's now common to allow battered women to introduce evidence to support defense claim. It makes sense in cases where actions were not overtly threatening, but prior history is relevant to show actor reasonably feared for her life. A reasonable person in her shoes would surely take such history of abuse into consideration in determining whether threat is deadly
  * Expert testimony - Gives D credibility as to her subjective belief and objective belief of similarly situated reasonable person
    * Any testimony is inadmissible in criminal case unless:
      * Subject matter is beyond the grasp of a lay person
      * Expert has sufficient knowledge/experience to aid jury in search for truth
      * The subject matter is such that it permits a reasonable opinion to be asserted by an expert (i.e. not something like phrenology or a novel/undeveloped science)
    * Varies by state and standard used by state to evaluate the reasonableness of the perceived threat

### *People v. Goetz* (1986 NY)

* Facts: Man approached on subway by unarmed 4 men attempting to rob him (two have them had screwdrivers). He shot and wounded all four of them with an unlicensed hand gun. He later admitted he didn't think the robbers had weapons but was afraid of being jumped because he had been mugged before. After indictment, D attempted to get dismissed the assault and attempted murder charges, contending that jury was improperly instructed to apply "reasonable man" standard. The court granted this dismissal, holding the objective element included in the instructions was erroneous
* Issue: Is a person justified in using deadly force in self-defense if he subjectively believed such force was necessary to prevent an attack or a robbery? Or must there be objectively reasonable belief under the circumstances?
* Rule: **A person is justified in using deadly force in self-defense or defense of another only if she objectively and reasonably believes an attacker is either (1) using or about to use deadly force or (2) committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy, or robbery**
* Holding: Grand jury was properly instructed; dismissal overturned and charges re-instated
  * The right to use deadly force in self-defense has contained an element of objective reasonableness from the days of the common law
  * Legislature in NY State specifically rejected MPC approach of allowing subjective mistaken belief that motivated use of force to negate intent requirement, thus only allowing negligent/reckless homicide
  * The repeated references to reasonableness are proof of the legislative intent that there be **an objectively reasonable basis for the belief** (only then will mistaken belief be justified)
  * Court not persuade that objective standard would preclude taking circumstances into consideration; **courts may still consider the situation, including the defendant’s knowledge and prior experience, in determining whether the belief was reasonable**

### *State v. Kelly* (1984 NJ)

* Facts: D's husband beat and abused her for years. One day, D's husband attacked her in public and ran at her with his arms raised in a menacing nature. Not knowing if he was armed, D stabbed and killed her husband with scissors. She was charged with murder, and claimed self-defense. At trial, D's counsel called an expert witness on battered woman's syndrome, but the court determined her testimony was inadmissible. The jury convicted D of reckless manslaughter, a lesser charge. D appealed, claiming that the expert’s testimony should have been admitted at trial.
* Issue: Should the testimony have been allowed?
* Rules:
  * **Expert testimony on battered women's syndrome is admissible in the trial because if it is relevant to D's claim self-defense**
  * **Use of force in self-defense is only justified if the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for purpose of protecting themselves against use of unlawful force by such other person**
* Holding - Testimony should have been admissible; conviction is overturned and case remanded
  * Expert testimony on battered woman syndrome is relevant because it relates to D's claim of self-defense
    * Her defense claim is only justified if she reasonably believed force was necessary to protect herself against serious harm
  * Recurrent abuse and effects of battered woman's syndrome would have impacted D's reasonable belief about the threat of harm posed by the circumstances
    * "Combination of all these symptoms, resulting from sustained psychological and physical trauma compounded by aggravating social and economic factors, constitutes the battered woman's syndrome"
    * If not for D's status as a battered woman, this belief might not be reasonable
  * Battered woman's syndrome is also an appropriate subject for expert testimony. Despite the fact that the field is relatively new, the expert was sufficiently qualified. The question of whether the testimony is scientifically reliable is best left answered by the trial court
* Notes:
  * Court says BWS evidence is relevant to question of reasonableness, but the extent to which may be limited. Similar cases have provided further illumination on the standard of reasonableness
    * CA Supreme Court in *Humphrey* - Objective reasonableness must view the situation from D's perspective, though this is not changing the standard to a subjective one or a objective battered woman standard. Testimony can help jury overcome biases and misunderstandings which is relevant to how they view the evidence and how D perceived circumstances (also allowing them to better evaluate credibility of D). However, ultimate question is response of reasonable person under those circumstances
    * *Romero* - CA court property refused to instruct jury to use subjectivity in applying the standard or to apply a reasonable battered person standard
    * A few other courts have moved closer to a fully subjective standard, some going as far to consider if a person who had assumed psychological peculiarities of D would have reasonable belief under the circumstances (e.g. ND). Others have applied something like a reasonable battered person standard (e.g. MO)
      * Arguments have been advanced that purely objective standard of reasonableness is unfair because it cannot be possibly be met by D because such a reasonable person does not have her perspective or history of experiencing violence and psychological trauma. On the other hand, completely subjective standard removes the normative component by introducing a form of moral relativism
  
### *State v. Norman* (1989 NC)

* Facts: D was abused, physically and psychologically, by her husband for most of their 25 year marriage. Some of the abuse incidents were extremely severe, leading to a suicide attempt. After being beat particularly bad, D shot husband while he was asleep. She was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, but appealed citing BWS as a defense and CoA reversed and remanded for new trial with jury being instructed of the defense. State appeals to NC Supreme Court
* Rules:
  * **D is entitled to have jury consider acquittal by reason of perfect self-defense when evidence (viewed in most favorable light) tends to show that at time of the killing, D believed it was necessary to kill to save themselves from imminent bodily harm**
  * Imperfect self-defense, which reduces culpability, is also recognized where victim escalates confrontation to point where it reasonably appears to D killing is necessary to prevent serious harm
* Holding: D was not entitled to perfect or imperfect self-defense
  * Killing out of self-preservation can only be justified by utmost necessity, which is why harm must by imminent
    * Harm here was not imminent. There was no immediate danger that could not be guarded against by any other way (e.g. through summoning protection of the law). Victim was sleeping and had been for some time. D had opportunity to resort to other means
    * Subjective belief of what is inevitable at some indefinite point in time is not "imminent". Even more, it hadn't be established that whatever victim might have done to D in the future (based on history of abuse) would have constituted the level of serious bodily harm necessary to justify using deadly force
      * Too much speculation here to warrant self-defense instruction based on evidence
* Dissent:
  * For the battered wife, there is no escape from the abuse. The next attack from the abuser could be the fatal one and thus, the abused wife is in constant fear of imminent death
  * The relevant question was whether belief in the impending nature of the threat, given the circumstances as Norman viewed them, was reasonable in the mind of a reasonable person
* Notes: 30 something states recognized gender-neutral "battered" defense

### *State v. Abbott* (1961)

* Facts: D got into a fist fight with V1 over a dispute involving a driveway D shared with V's family. V2 and V3 then came after D with a hatchet and carving knife/large fork. The parties’ accounts of what happened differed, but each of the Vs was ultimately hit by the hatchet. D was indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon each of the Vs. A jury acquitted D of charges related to V2 and V3, but found him guilty of the charge related to V1. D appealed
* Rule: **An individual has a duty to retreat before using deadly force to defend himself only to the point that he knows that he may retreat with complete safety**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed because the trial court’s instructions on retreat were ambiguous and confusing
  * The issue of whether an individual must retreat only arises if the defendant resorts to the use of deadly force to defend himself
    * MPC instructs that the use of deadly force is not justifiable if the actor knows he can avoid the use of such force by retreating with complete safety
  * If the individual does not use deadly force to defend himself, he may stand his ground regardless of the force used by an aggressor
  * Thus, jury should have been instructed to determine two issues:
    1. Did D intend to use deadly force himself? If not, he had every right to stand his ground using non-deadly force
    1. If so, did D know the opportunity to retreat with complete safety was present during the altercation?
* Notes:
  * Duty to retreat when faced with an aggressor before using deadly force to defend himself has historically divided the courts
    * Advocates of the no-retreat rule argue that an individual must hold one’s ground. They argue that the law should not require something that resembles cowardice ("true man doctrine")
    * Proponents of the retreat rule claim it is better that an assailed individual flee instead of unnecessarily taking a life
    * The MPC embraces the retreat rule while acknowledging that most courts oppose it
  * Traditional common law rule imposed a strict duty to retreat, allowing use of deadly force in self-defense only if every opportunity to flee had been exhausted ("had back against the wall" concept). Over time, majority of states adopted no-retreat or "true man" rule
    * However, it is a bit more complex than that. Some states still retain require retreat when confrontation occurs outside the home while several others treat possibility of retreat as a factor
    * States that still retain the retreat rule will make **exception to requirement of retreating where it is dangerous to do so**
  * **Stand your ground statutes**:
    * 33 states enacted laws permitting force to be met by force, including deadly force, even in public spaces where retreat is possible. While this enables those who are truly innocent to protect themselves and potentially save lives, there is also the issue of unintended consequences: more unnecessary killings may result and mistakes can be made on unfounded suspicion (including that which is racially influenced)
  * **Castle exception**
    * Even where retreat rule is still enforced, jurisdictions invariably make exception for using deadly force in home invasions
      * Not as clear in cases within the home where confrontation is between homeowner and guests or even co-occupants

### *United States v. Peterson* (1973 DC)

* Facts: V attempts to steal windshield wipers from D's store. D and V argue and D retreat's to store to get gun. When he returns outside, V is in car and prepared to drive away. D threatens to shoot and kill him, at which point V gets out of the car wielding a wrench. D warns V not to come any further. V continued moving towards D so he shoots and kills him. Instructions to jury included: self-defense generally not recognized if D provokes (though words are not enough), however it is if D withdraws from the conflict in good faith and let V know through words or actions. Also, there is no strict duty to retreat, but it is factor to be considered in determining necessity. D is convicted of manslaughter and appeals, challenging the jury instructions
* Rules:
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict may not invoke the doctrine of self-defense to justify killing his adversary, unless he withdrew from the conflict in good faith and communicated his withdrawal by words or acts**
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict is under a duty to retreat, if he may do so safely, before using deadly force in self-defense**
* Holding - Verdict is affirmed; jury was properly instructed
  * Court affirms instruction that self-defense not available to the aggressor, a rule that is based on the doctrine of necessity
    * Deadly force is only justified if there is no alternative. A person must honestly and reasonably believe that there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury
    * Person who provokes conflict does not have right to exercise deadly force. However, this right is restored if aggressor withdraws and communicates this to the victim
    * Since grabbing the gun made D the initial aggressor, jury instruction was correct. Jury would then need to decide if he properly withdrew or else self-defense would not be justified
  * Court affirms instruction that jury consider whether there was opportunity to safely retreat (quite obvious that there was)
    * DC still follows retreat rule; there is duty to avoid use of deadly force by retreating unless it would be dangerous to do so
    * Castle doctrine does not apply to initial aggressors, thus this would not remove him from the retreat rule despite this confrontation occurring on his own property
* Notes:
  * Some states will also allow initial aggressor to regain right to self-defense if they are faced with an excessive life-threatening respond
  * *Allen v. State* (1994 OK)
    * Facts: D fighting with partner and as partner leaving the partner hits D in the face. D pursues partner in car and parked to ask partner to reconsider. Partner came towards D with rake and D shot partner
    * Holding - D who initiates a confrontation, even without intention of killing, loses the right of self-defense
  * MPC slightly deviates from common law rule found in both *Allen* and *Peterson*. MPC provides narrower forfeiture of self-defense rights - only if one provokes with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm
    * Example: A attacks B with fists and B defends himself. B manages to subdue A by pinning him to the floor and begins to violently slam his head into the ground. A, who now fears for his life, manages to escape B's hold. B charges at him again and he pulls out a knife, fatally stabbing B
      * Under MPC, A would only lose his right to self defense if he intended to kill/seriously harm B when initiating the conflict. Starting a mere fist fight does not express such intent. Since this fist fight doesn't satisfy subsection (1) either, B is also not justified in using deadly force in response, but can only defend himself using moderate, non-deadly force. Once B begins slamming A's head into the ground, he clearly exceeds the boundaries of moderate force. At this point, A would be justified in using deadly force under subsection (1), but only if he believes

## Justification - Defense of Property

### *People v. Ceballos* (1974 CA)

* Facts - D set up spring gun in garage after noticing evidence that someone had attempted to forcibly enter. One night two teenage boys try to enter the garage, and one of the boys is shot in the face. D found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon. D contends use of the spring gun was lawful since it would have been lawful to exercise deadly force had he been present that time of the attempted burglary - he has right to do indirectly what he can do directly
* An individual may be held criminally or civilly liable if he sets upon his premises a deadly mechanical device which injures or kills another person
* Holding - Conviction is upheld
  * Regardless of tort liability in this area, the direct/indirect argument is not workable in this context. Person has control and discretion over the exercise of deadly force when physically present. Not the case with a spring gun; it poses significant safety risks to children, firefights, etc. Thus, liability depends on fortuitous results and imperils the lives of innocent people
  * Even if the direct/indirect argument was recognized as valid, D wouldn't have been justified in using deadly force even if he were there
    * MPC appears to permit use of deadly force when resisting attempt of a felony or in defense of property against one who manifestly intends, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony
    * However, literal interpretation is undesirable here since the categorization of "felony" has been expanded to include a very wide number of crimes, many of which are essentially non-violent. Case law has narrowed the interpretation of this language to mean atrocious crimes committed by force. This also applies to the "surprise or violence" language
    * **Where the character and manner of the burglary do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for exaction of human life or use of deadly force**
  * Here, two unarmed teenagers did not present such a threat. D's belief that burglary could present such a threat, which lead him to install the trap gun, is both unfounded and does not shield him from liability
* Notes
  * MPC limits use of deadly force, but will nonetheless permit it when the use of non-deadly force to prevent commission of the crime would expose the individual to substantial danger of serious harm
  * Some states have passed statutes expanding the use of deadly force in the home
    * CA Home Protection Bill of Rights - Reasonable fear of imminent serious harm is presumed by owner using deadly force when intruder does and is known to have unlawfully and forcibly entered the home
    * Colorado "Make-My-Day" law - Can use any level of force when non-occupant has made unlawful entry onto the property and there is reasonable belief that he intends to commit a crime
    * FL "stand your ground" - Whenever intruder forcibly enters car or dwelling, reasonable imminent fear is presumed if intruder was in process of unlawful entry and the person threatened knew or had reason to believe forcible/unlawful entry was occurring

### *Syndor v. State* (2001 MD)

* Facts: D approached at gunpoint to give up property and is assaulted. While being robbed, friends intervene and disarm robber. Robber attempts to flee but D shoots and kills him. Judge instructed trial jury that D was required to retreat/stand-down unless at the moment shots were fired, D was being robbed. D argues the attempt to flee was part of one continuous transaction
* Holding: Jury instructions were appropriate
  * CoA rejected D's argument. It acknowledged that for purpose of felony murder, robbery is not complete until the suspect escapes. However, that doesn't effect rule limiting deadly force
    * Court says relevant issue is not whether criminal enterprise is still in operation, **but whether the force then and there was necessary to avoid imminent danger of serious harm**
    * It was clear that no such threat of harm was posed by robber while attempting to flee unarmed, thus force was excessive

## Justification - Use of Force in Law Enforcement

* General principle is the same as it as for civilians: force must never be excessive in relation to the harm it seeks to prevent
  * However, law enforcement is different because it is not their duty to avoid danger, but to intervene. Much more dangerous work environment and carry firearms
  * Tension between ability to defuse conflict and prevent trouble by force or threat of force and the capacity to inflict unwarranted or unintended injury which may undermine community bonds and flare racial tensions
* Problem: Reasonable belief that a suspect poses serious threat may be informed by social, cultural, and racial presuppositions
  * 21 times as many African-Americans are shot by police than are whites
* When is it acceptable to use deadly force?
  * Not permissible to prevent misdemeanor or effectuate arrest for one - can't shoot suspect of misdemeanor who flees without resisting
    * However, as a general principle, **if suspect's flight poses threat of death or great harm to the public**, use of force may be justified (See *Scott v. Harris*, *Plumhoff v. Rickard*)
    * Additionally, if suspect of misdemeanor resists, general rule is that **officer may meet force with force**, and if threatened with deadly force, they may respond in kind because such response is needed to protect officer from threat of serious harm or death
  * Used to allow deadly force to prevent or make felony arrest. However as definition of felony expanded, courts restricted deadly force to situations involving **forcible and atrocious crime**
    * Such conduct includes use or threat of deadly force, thus substantial risk that failure to immediately apprehend will lead to such harm and thus police are justified in using deadly force to prevent it
    * Use of deadly force to apprehend suspect of felony like burglary has been found to be an "unreasonable" seizure in violation of 4A and thus unconstitutional (See *Tennessee v. Garner*)
      * Constitutional standard is similar to MPC. In order **to justify use of deadly force to prevent felon's escape, it must be necessary measure taken where probable cause exists as to the belief that suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officers or others**
    * Use of taser is generally not considered deadly force

## Justification - Necessity Defense (“Choice of Evils”)

* Necessity = Defense that otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable as it was necessary to avoid more serious harm
* MPC 3.02
  * (1) D’s otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable if:
    * D sought to avoid harm greater than the harm resulting from D’s conduct
      * Does not rely on the private judgement of D. **The harm/evil sought to be avoided must actually be greater than that from the commission of the offense, regardless of D's belief**
      * Not enough that actor beliefs conduct is sufficient to ameliorate the harm. **Must believe it was necessary to avoid the evils**
    * Statute does not explicitly preclude necessity defense
    * No obvious legislative purpose or policy reason to deny necessity defense
  * (2) Necessity NOT a defense if situation brought about by D’s reckless or negligent conduct
* CL Self-Defense (see *Unger*)
  * (1) No blame in developing the situation AND
  * (2) D reasonably believed engaging in conduct was necessary to avoid a harm greater than a resulting harm which might result from the conduct (see *Hutchins*) AND
  * (3) (split jurisdiction) Satisfying credibility factors is:
    * Required - D must notify law enforcement as soon as the threat ends (see Bailey, Unger)
    * Not Required - D does not need to notify law enforcement, factors considered holistically
  
### *People v. Unger* (1977 IL)

* Facts:  D (inmate) at minimum security prison sexually assaulted and threatened with rape. Gets anonymous phone call threating to kill him because caller (falsely) heard the D had reported it to prison authorities. D leaves the facilities and is apprehended days later several miles away
* Rule: **Justifiable by reason of necessity if the defendant was without blame in developing the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than the injury which might result from his own conduct**
* Reasoning:
  * In *Harmon*, defense of duress was held to apply in case where D alleged that he escaped to avoided repeated homosexual attacks from fellow inmates. Courts had reached similar results in escape cases involving sexual abuse under the theory of necessity
  * Court says necessity is the appropriate defense here - D was not deprived of free will by threat of harm (i.e. duress). Rather, he was **forced to chose between two imminent evils**, as supported by his testimony
  * Factors considered to determine reasonableness of necessity defense include: The threat and imminence of the threat; Opportunity to complain or seek protection through courts/law; No violence employed in the escape; and immediately reports to authorities once reaches position of safety from the threat
    * Must not satisfy all of these to assert necessity defense as matter of law, but relevant consideration
  * Under circumstances, D was entitled to jury instructions for necessity defense - he had no part in developing the situation (i.e. threats against him) and injury avoided by escaping is more harmful than the escape
* Dissent - Allowing this defense will create trouble in the future and may encourage undesirable conduct

### *United States v. Schoon* (1992 9th Cir.)

* Facts: Group of Ds gained access to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office in AZ where they protested the policy between US and El Salvador. Chanted, splashed fake blood, and generally obstructed the office’s operation. After repeated warnings to leave or face arrest by a federal police officer, group was arrested after refusing to comply. At trial, Ds proffered testimony about conditions in El Salvador as motivations for their conduct and argued that their actions were necessary to avoid further bloodshed. Judge rejected "necessity" defense and Ds were convicted
* Issue: Is the necessity defense available in indirect civil disobedience cases?
* Rule: **The necessity defense requires a defendant to show that he was faced with a choice between two related evils, that he acted to prevent imminent harm, and there was no legal alternative to violating the law. It is unavailable in indirect civil disobedience cases**
* Holding - Court holds that necessity defense was properly rejected in the trial court
  * To properly invoke the necessity defense, the defendants must have shown that (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law
  * “Civil disobedience” is the willful violation of a law, undertaken for the purpose of social or political protest. Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law or interfering with a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest
  * The mere existence of a constitutional law or governmental policy cannot constitute a legally cognizable harm. Thus, no greater harm to avert. Court must also take into consideration the likelihood that an alleged harm will be abated by the criminal action. Here, the protest alone is unlikely to change the policy towards El Salvador precisely because the act is indirect. Finally, possibility that congress could change its mind is sufficient to make lawful political action a reasonable alternative to the unlawful conduct

### *Regina v. Dudley and Stephens* (1884 UK)

* Facts: Defendants were on the crew of an English yacht. Ship wrecks and become stranded at sea for 24 days. After week without food, they kill one of the weaker crew members and fed off his body until a passing ship rescued them. Ds tried for murder of the crew member. Trial jury determined Ds would not have survived long enough to be rescued had they not done what they did. They also determined that the member that was killed also would not have survived. Ultimately unable to reach verdict
* Issue: Will the defense of necessity justify a homicide committed to save the defendants' own lives?
* Rule: **The intentional killing of another is murder unless there is some legal justification (e.g. self-defense)**
* Holding: Defendants found guilty of murder and sentenced to death (later commuted to 6 months)
  * Necessity is only a justification for murder when the killing is committed in self-defense. Thus, the defense of necessity may not be used to justify the killing of an innocent bystander.There is no authority supporting the principle that one may take the life of an innocent person to save his own
* Notes:
  * MPC Commentaries appears to endorse utilitarian approach to the "two-evils" problem. Numerical calculus to justify the intentional killing of an innocent person in order to save lives, which is lesser evil than the death of several others. This is a real life trolley problem. Direct tension between rights and maximizing lives

### *Public Committee Against Torture v. Israel* (1999 Israeli Supreme Court)

* Facts: Israeli government (D) authorized one if its national security agencies to employ physical means against those undergoing interrogation. Included sleep deprivation, shaking, forcing subjects to stay in painful positions for long amounts of time. Agency was instructed to consider urgency/severity of potential attacks and to seek alternative measures if possible. Agency argued these methods help thwart imminent terrorist attacks
* Issue: Were torture methods acceptable under the defense of “necessity” as codified in Penal Law Article 34(1), which states, "A person will not bear criminal liability for committing any act immediately necessary for the purpose of saving the life, liberty, body or property, of either himself or his fellow person, from substantial danger of serious harm, imminent from the particular circumstances, at the requisite time, and absent alternative means for avoiding the harm"?
* Holding: Methods of torture are categorically prohibited and thus unauthorized for use even under necessity exception
  * The interrogation of a suspect must “absolutely” be free of torture, free of cruel and inhuman treatment, and free of dignity-taking methods. Methods employed by the agency violated the subjects' dignity
  * While necessity exception would definitely arise in "ticking time bomb situation" where physical methods used to obtain information about imminent attack and spare innocent lives. However, question is whether the use of such physical means were authorized. The order prohibiting physical means of interrogation is made absolute and can't be justified by necessity

## Justification - Euthanasia

### *Crusan v. Missouri Dept. of Health* (1989)

* Facts - P in vegetative state following car accident and, with no chance of recovery, family requested she be removed from life support. Some evidence from past conversation P would want life support withdrawn. The hospital refused to do so without a court order. The trial court granted P's parents petition to remove the tube. Missouri Supreme Court reversed and held that the evidence of P's desire not to continue life-prolonging treatment was not clear and convincing and thus P's parents lacked the authority to effectuate the court order
* Is Missouri's evidentiary standard for establishing intent to withdraw treatment constitutionally valid?
* Holding - State evidentiary standard is valid and upheld
  * An incompetent person is not able to make informed and rational choice here. Any such right must be exercised by a surrogate
  * Here, Missouri allows surrogate to act for patient in deciding to withdraw life support
  * However, Missouri employs a procedural safeguard by requiring the  decision conform as closely to the incapacitated person's wishes as closely as possible. Thus it requires clear and convincing evidence as to the wishes of the incapacitated person
    * This procedural requirement relies on State's interest in preserving and protecting human life. There is no denying this is a valid state interest

### *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997)

* Facts: Under Washington state law, it is a crime to knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide. P, a physician, brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that the Washington state law violated a liberty interest protected by 14A. District court found that it did and CoA affirmed.
* Rule: The right to physician-assisted suicide is not a constitutionally-protected liberty interest under the 14A DPC, though jurisdictions may allow it
* Holding: Washington law banning P.A.S. is constitutional
  * Bans on P.A.S. represent those states’ commitment to the protection and preservation of all human life, a legitimate interest
  * Right to P.A.S. is not a fundamental right under the DPC - the Nation’s history and tradition has almost uniformly rejected the existence of the right, and most states continue to explicitly reject it in the present day
  * The right to P.A.S. is distinguishable from the right of competent persons to remove unwanted life-sustaining treatment recognized in *Cruzan*: the right to be free from unwanted medical procedures, at issue in *Cruzan*, is long established in national traditions upholding bodily integrity and protecting against battery, even by physicians
