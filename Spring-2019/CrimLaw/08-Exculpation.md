# Exculpation

* 3 distinct sorts of defenses can be invoked to bar conviction for an alleged crime:
  1. Assertion that prosecution has failed to establish one or more required elements of the offense
  1. Justification - Affirmative defense that D acted properly
  1. Excuse - Affirmative defense that while the act is not condoned, D’s responsibility is mitigated
* Justification and excuse are different from the first insofar as they don't seek to refute any require element of prosecution's case; rather they suggest considerations that negate liability even when all elements are present

## Justification - Self Defense

* When the use of defensive force against an aggressor is necessary to protect the actor from seriously bodily harm, that action is justified - it was the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances
  * However, court in *Peterson* states widely accepted view that it **isn't required that use of force be truly necessary**; it is available when the **actor reasonably believes defensive force to be necessary**
  * If it turns out that force wasn't truly necessary and reasonable belief was false, then it is more precise to say that the actor is excused; the action was not right, but the mistake was reasonable. Regardless of the label (usually labeled as a justification), one who satisfies the self-defense requirement is entitled to acquittal

* **MPC 3.04**
  * (1) Force justifiable if D subjectively believes it is "immediately necessary for purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force"
  * (2)
    * (a) Force is NOT justifiable if:
      * (i) D knowingly resists lawful arrest
      * (ii) D knowingly resists force of person protecting their property
    * (b) Use of **deadly** force is only justifiable if actor believes force is necessary to protect against death/serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or forced sexual intercourse. It is also unjustified if:
      * (i) Actor provoked the use of force against him in the same encounter with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm (i.e. is the initial aggressor)
      * (ii) Actor knows he can avoid necessity of using such force with safety by retreating, surrendering property, or complying with demands that he abstain from some action. Exceptions:
        * (1) Not obliged to retreat from dwelling or place of work unless he was initial aggressor or is assailed by co-worker
    * (c) Other than in subsections (a) and (b), person using protective force may estimate its necessity under the circumstances as he believes them to be without surrender or retreat
  
* **Battered Women's Syndrome**
  * Different subcultures of violence between the sexes. When women do kill, it frequently targeted towards an abusive spouse or partner. In these cases, it is not uncommon for D to assert defense of self-defense on the basis of history of physical and mental abuse and the associated trauma
  * We see this in two forms
    * Confrontational homicides - Woman kills partner amidst battering incident. This is most common and primary issue becomes whether D is entitled to introduce history of abuse evidence and expert testimony
    * Non-confrontational homicides - Battered woman kills abuser in his sleep. Here the issues are related to (1) the imminent threat requirement and whether D is entitled to jury instruction on self defense absent some aggressive act by the abuser; and (2) can BWS evidence and testimony be introduced to show that D reasonably subjectively believed such actions were necessary to combat imminent deadly assault. Courts are divided here
    * Evidence of prior abuse not ordinarily allowed - the victim is not the one on trial and it improperly focuses jury in his character. However, it's now common to allow battered women to introduce evidence to support defense claim. It makes sense in cases where actions were not overtly threatening, but prior history is relevant to show actor reasonably feared for her life. A reasonable person in her shoes would surely take such history of abuse into consideration in determining whether threat is deadly
  * Expert testimony - Gives D credibility as to her subjective belief and objective belief of similarly situated reasonable person
    * Any testimony is inadmissible in criminal case unless:
      * Subject matter is beyond the grasp of a lay person
      * Expert has sufficient knowledge/experience to aid jury in search for truth
      * The subject matter is such that it permits a reasonable opinion to be asserted by an expert (i.e. not something like phrenology or a novel/undeveloped science)
    * Varies by state and standard used by state to evaluate the reasonableness of the perceived threat

### *People v. Goetz* (1986 NY)

* Facts: Man approached on subway by unarmed 4 men attempting to rob him (two have them had screwdrivers). He shot and wounded all four of them with an unlicensed hand gun. He later admitted he didn't think the robbers had weapons but was afraid of being jumped because he had been mugged before. After indictment, D attempted to get dismissed the assault and attempted murder charges, contending that jury was improperly instructed to apply "reasonable man" standard. The court granted this dismissal, holding the objective element included in the instructions was erroneous
* Issue: Is a person justified in using deadly force in self-defense if he subjectively believed such force was necessary to prevent an attack or a robbery? Or must there be objectively reasonable belief under the circumstances?
* Rule: **A person is justified in using deadly force in self-defense or defense of another only if she objectively and reasonably believes an attacker is either (1) using or about to use deadly force or (2) committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy, or robbery**
* Holding: Grand jury was properly instructed; dismissal overturned and charges re-instated
  * The right to use deadly force in self-defense has contained an element of objective reasonableness from the days of the common law
  * Legislature in NY State specifically rejected MPC approach of allowing subjective mistaken belief that motivated use of force to negate intent requirement, thus only allowing negligent/reckless homicide
  * The repeated references to reasonableness are proof of the legislative intent that there be **an objectively reasonable basis for the belief** (only then will mistaken belief be justified)
  * Court not persuade that objective standard would preclude taking circumstances into consideration; **courts may still consider the situation, including the defendant’s knowledge and prior experience, in determining whether the belief was reasonable**

### *State v. Kelly* (1984 NJ)

* Facts: D's husband beat and abused her for years. One day, D's husband attacked her in public and ran at her with his arms raised in a menacing nature. Not knowing if he was armed, D stabbed and killed her husband with scissors. She was charged with murder, and claimed self-defense. At trial, D's counsel called an expert witness on battered woman's syndrome, but the court determined her testimony was inadmissible. The jury convicted D of reckless manslaughter, a lesser charge. D appealed, claiming that the expert’s testimony should have been admitted at trial.
* Issue: Should the testimony have been allowed?
* Rules:
  * **Expert testimony on battered women's syndrome is admissible in the trial because if it is relevant to D's claim self-defense**
  * **Use of force in self-defense is only justified if the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for purpose of protecting themselves against use of unlawful force by such other person**
* Holding - Testimony should have been admissible; conviction is overturned and case remanded
  * Expert testimony on battered woman syndrome is relevant because it relates to D's claim of self-defense
    * Her defense claim is only justified if she reasonably believed force was necessary to protect herself against serious harm
  * Recurrent abuse and effects of battered woman's syndrome would have impacted D's reasonable belief about the threat of harm posed by the circumstances
    * "Combination of all these symptoms, resulting from sustained psychological and physical trauma compounded by aggravating social and economic factors, constitutes the battered woman's syndrome"
    * If not for D's status as a battered woman, this belief might not be reasonable
  * Battered woman's syndrome is also an appropriate subject for expert testimony. Despite the fact that the field is relatively new, the expert was sufficiently qualified. The question of whether the testimony is scientifically reliable is best left answered by the trial court
* Notes:
  * Court says BWS evidence is relevant to question of reasonableness, but the extent to which may be limited. Similar cases have provided further illumination on the standard of reasonableness
    * CA Supreme Court in *Humphrey* - Objective reasonableness must view the situation from D's perspective, though this is not changing the standard to a subjective one or a objective battered woman standard. Testimony can help jury overcome biases and misunderstandings which is relevant to how they view the evidence and how D perceived circumstances (also allowing them to better evaluate credibility of D). However, ultimate question is response of reasonable person under those circumstances
    * *Romero* - CA court property refused to instruct jury to use subjectivity in applying the standard or to apply a reasonable battered person standard
    * A few other courts have moved closer to a fully subjective standard, some going as far to consider if a person who had assumed psychological peculiarities of D would have reasonable belief under the circumstances (e.g. ND). Others have applied something like a reasonable battered person standard (e.g. MO)
      * Arguments have been advanced that purely objective standard of reasonableness is unfair because it cannot be possibly be met by D because such a reasonable person does not have her perspective or history of experiencing violence and psychological trauma. On the other hand, completely subjective standard removes the normative component by introducing a form of moral relativism
  
### *State v. Norman* (1989 NC)

* Facts: D was abused, physically and psychologically, by her husband for most of their 25 year marriage. Some of the abuse incidents were extremely severe, leading to a suicide attempt. After being beat particularly bad, D shot husband while he was asleep. She was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, but appealed citing BWS as a defense and CoA reversed and remanded for new trial with jury being instructed of the defense. State appeals to NC Supreme Court
* Rules:
  * **D is entitled to have jury consider acquittal by reason of perfect self-defense when evidence (viewed in most favorable light) tends to show that at time of the killing, D believed it was necessary to kill to save themselves from imminent bodily harm**
  * Imperfect self-defense, which reduces culpability, is also recognized where victim escalates confrontation to point where it reasonably appears to D killing is necessary to prevent serious harm
* Holding: D was not entitled to perfect or imperfect self-defense
  * Killing out of self-preservation can only be justified by utmost necessity, which is why harm must by imminent
    * Harm here was not imminent. There was no immediate danger that could not be guarded against by any other way (e.g. through summoning protection of the law). Victim was sleeping and had been for some time. D had opportunity to resort to other means
    * Subjective belief of what is inevitable at some indefinite point in time is not "imminent". Even more, it hadn't be established that whatever victim might have done to D in the future (based on history of abuse) would have constituted the level of serious bodily harm necessary to justify using deadly force
      * Too much speculation here to warrant self-defense instruction based on evidence
* Dissent:
  * For the battered wife, there is no escape from the abuse. The next attack from the abuser could be the fatal one and thus, the abused wife is in constant fear of imminent death
  * The relevant question was whether belief in the impending nature of the threat, given the circumstances as Norman viewed them, was reasonable in the mind of a reasonable person
* Notes: 30 something states recognized gender-neutral "battered" defense

### *State v. Abbott* (1961)

* Facts: D got into a fist fight with V1 over a dispute involving a driveway D shared with V's family. V2 and V3 then came after D with a hatchet and carving knife/large fork. The parties’ accounts of what happened differed, but each of the Vs was ultimately hit by the hatchet. D was indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon each of the Vs. A jury acquitted D of charges related to V2 and V3, but found him guilty of the charge related to V1. D appealed
* Rule: **An individual has a duty to retreat before using deadly force to defend himself only to the point that he knows that he may retreat with complete safety**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed because the trial court’s instructions on retreat were ambiguous and confusing
  * The issue of whether an individual must retreat only arises if the defendant resorts to the use of deadly force to defend himself
    * MPC instructs that the use of deadly force is not justifiable if the actor knows he can avoid the use of such force by retreating with complete safety
  * If the individual does not use deadly force to defend himself, he may stand his ground regardless of the force used by an aggressor
  * Thus, jury should have been instructed to determine two issues:
    1. Did D intend to use deadly force himself? If not, he had every right to stand his ground using non-deadly force
    1. If so, did D know the opportunity to retreat with complete safety was present during the altercation?
* Notes:
  * Duty to retreat when faced with an aggressor before using deadly force to defend himself has historically divided the courts
    * Advocates of the no-retreat rule argue that an individual must hold one’s ground. They argue that the law should not require something that resembles cowardice ("true man doctrine")
    * Proponents of the retreat rule claim it is better that an assailed individual flee instead of unnecessarily taking a life
    * The MPC embraces the retreat rule while acknowledging that most courts oppose it
  * Traditional common law rule imposed a strict duty to retreat, allowing use of deadly force in self-defense only if every opportunity to flee had been exhausted ("had back against the wall" concept). Over time, majority of states adopted no-retreat or "true man" rule
    * However, it is a bit more complex than that. Some states still retain require retreat when confrontation occurs outside the home while several others treat possibility of retreat as a factor
    * States that still retain the retreat rule will make **exception to requirement of retreating where it is dangerous to do so**
  * **Stand your ground statutes**:
    * 33 states enacted laws permitting force to be met by force, including deadly force, even in public spaces where retreat is possible. While this enables those who are truly innocent to protect themselves and potentially save lives, there is also the issue of unintended consequences: more unnecessary killings may result and mistakes can be made on unfounded suspicion (including that which is racially influenced)
  * **Castle exception**
    * Even where retreat rule is still enforced, jurisdictions invariably make exception for using deadly force in home invasions
      * Not as clear in cases within the home where confrontation is between homeowner and guests or even co-occupants

### *United States v. Peterson* (1973 DC)

* Facts: V attempts to steal windshield wipers from D's store. D and V argue and D retreat's to store to get gun. When he returns outside, V is in car and prepared to drive away. D threatens to shoot and kill him, at which point V gets out of the car wielding a wrench. D warns V not to come any further. V continued moving towards D so he shoots and kills him. Instructions to jury included: self-defense generally not recognized if D provokes (though words are not enough), however it is if D withdraws from the conflict in good faith and let V know through words or actions. Also, there is no strict duty to retreat, but it is factor to be considered in determining necessity. D is convicted of manslaughter and appeals, challenging the jury instructions
* Rules:
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict may not invoke the doctrine of self-defense to justify killing his adversary, unless he withdrew from the conflict in good faith and communicated his withdrawal by words or acts**
    1. **The initial aggressor in a fatal conflict is under a duty to retreat, if he may do so safely, before using deadly force in self-defense**
* Holding - Verdict is affirmed; jury was properly instructed
  * Court affirms instruction that self-defense not available to the aggressor, a rule that is based on the doctrine of necessity
    * Deadly force is only justified if there is no alternative. A person must honestly and reasonably believe that there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury
    * Person who provokes conflict does not have right to exercise deadly force. However, this right is restored if aggressor withdraws and communicates this to the victim
    * Since grabbing the gun made D the initial aggressor, jury instruction was correct. Jury would then need to decide if he properly withdrew or else self-defense would not be justified
  * Court affirms instruction that jury consider whether there was opportunity to safely retreat (quite obvious that there was)
    * DC still follows retreat rule; there is duty to avoid use of deadly force by retreating unless it would be dangerous to do so
    * Castle doctrine does not apply to initial aggressors, thus this would not remove him from the retreat rule despite this confrontation occurring on his own property
* Notes:
  * Some states will also allow initial aggressor to regain right to self-defense if they are faced with an excessive life-threatening respond
  * *Allen v. State* (1994 OK)
    * Facts: D fighting with partner and as partner leaving the partner hits D in the face. D pursues partner in car and parked to ask partner to reconsider. Partner came towards D with rake and D shot partner
    * Holding - D who initiates a confrontation, even without intention of killing, loses the right of self-defense
  * MPC slightly deviates from common law rule found in both *Allen* and *Peterson*. MPC provides narrower forfeiture of self-defense rights - only if one provokes with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm
    * Example: A attacks B with fists and B defends himself. B manages to subdue A by pinning him to the floor and begins to violently slam his head into the ground. A, who now fears for his life, manages to escape B's hold. B charges at him again and he pulls out a knife, fatally stabbing B
      * Under MPC, A would only lose his right to self defense if he intended to kill/seriously harm B when initiating the conflict. Starting a mere fist fight does not express such intent. Since this fist fight doesn't satisfy subsection (1) either, B is also not justified in using deadly force in response, but can only defend himself using moderate, non-deadly force. Once B begins slamming A's head into the ground, he clearly exceeds the boundaries of moderate force. At this point, A would be justified in using deadly force under subsection (1), but only if he believes

## Justification - Defense of Property

### *People v. Ceballos* (1974 CA)

* Facts - D set up spring gun in garage after noticing evidence that someone had attempted to forcibly enter. One night two teenage boys try to enter the garage, and one of the boys is shot in the face. D found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon. D contends use of the spring gun was lawful since it would have been lawful to exercise deadly force had he been present that time of the attempted burglary - he has right to do indirectly what he can do directly
* An individual may be held criminally or civilly liable if he sets upon his premises a deadly mechanical device which injures or kills another person
* Holding - Conviction is upheld
  * Regardless of tort liability in this area, the direct/indirect argument is not workable in this context. Person has control and discretion over the exercise of deadly force when physically present. Not the case with a spring gun; it poses significant safety risks to children, firefights, etc. Thus, liability depends on fortuitous results and imperils the lives of innocent people
  * Even if the direct/indirect argument was recognized as valid, D wouldn't have been justified in using deadly force even if he were there
    * MPC appears to permit use of deadly force when resisting attempt of a felony or in defense of property against one who manifestly intends, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony
    * However, literal interpretation is undesirable here since the categorization of "felony" has been expanded to include a very wide number of crimes, many of which are essentially non-violent. Case law has narrowed the interpretation of this language to mean atrocious crimes committed by force. This also applies to the "surprise or violence" language
    * **Where the character and manner of the burglary do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for exaction of human life or use of deadly force**
  * Here, two unarmed teenagers did not present such a threat. D's belief that burglary could present such a threat, which lead him to install the trap gun, is both unfounded and does not shield him from liability
* Notes
  * MPC limits use of deadly force, but will nonetheless permit it when the use of non-deadly force to prevent commission of the crime would expose the individual to substantial danger of serious harm
  * Some states have passed statutes expanding the use of deadly force in the home
    * CA Home Protection Bill of Rights - Reasonable fear of imminent serious harm is presumed by owner using deadly force when intruder does and is known to have unlawfully and forcibly entered the home
    * Colorado "Make-My-Day" law - Can use any level of force when non-occupant has made unlawful entry onto the property and there is reasonable belief that he intends to commit a crime
    * FL "stand your ground" - Whenever intruder forcibly enters car or dwelling, reasonable imminent fear is presumed if intruder was in process of unlawful entry and the person threatened knew or had reason to believe forcible/unlawful entry was occurring

### *Syndor v. State* (2001 MD)

* Facts: D approached at gunpoint to give up property and is assaulted. While being robbed, friends intervene and disarm robber. Robber attempts to flee but D shoots and kills him. Judge instructed trial jury that D was required to retreat/stand-down unless at the moment shots were fired, D was being robbed. D argues the attempt to flee was part of one continuous transaction
* Holding: Jury instructions were appropriate
  * CoA rejected D's argument. It acknowledged that for purpose of felony murder, robbery is not complete until the suspect escapes. However, that doesn't effect rule limiting deadly force
    * Court says relevant issue is not whether criminal enterprise is still in operation, **but whether the force then and there was necessary to avoid imminent danger of serious harm**
    * It was clear that no such threat of harm was posed by robber while attempting to flee unarmed, thus force was excessive

## Justification - Use of Force in Law Enforcement

* General principle is the same as it as for civilians: force must never be excessive in relation to the harm it seeks to prevent
  * However, law enforcement is different because it is not their duty to avoid danger, but to intervene. Much more dangerous work environment and carry firearms
  * Tension between ability to defuse conflict and prevent trouble by force or threat of force and the capacity to inflict unwarranted or unintended injury which may undermine community bonds and flare racial tensions
* Problem: Reasonable belief that a suspect poses serious threat may be informed by social, cultural, and racial presuppositions
  * 21 times as many African-Americans are shot by police than are whites
* When is it acceptable to use deadly force?
  * Not permissible to prevent misdemeanor or effectuate arrest for one - can't shoot suspect of misdemeanor who flees without resisting
    * However, as a general principle, **if suspect's flight poses threat of death or great harm to the public**, use of force may be justified (See *Scott v. Harris*, *Plumhoff v. Rickard*)
    * Additionally, if suspect of misdemeanor resists, general rule is that **officer may meet force with force**, and if threatened with deadly force, they may respond in kind because such response is needed to protect officer from threat of serious harm or death
  * Used to allow deadly force to prevent or make felony arrest. However as definition of felony expanded, courts restricted deadly force to situations involving **forcible and atrocious crime**
    * Such conduct includes use or threat of deadly force, thus substantial risk that failure to immediately apprehend will lead to such harm and thus police are justified in using deadly force to prevent it
    * Use of deadly force to apprehend suspect of felony like burglary has been found to be an "unreasonable" seizure in violation of 4A and thus unconstitutional (See *Tennessee v. Garner*)
      * Constitutional standard is similar to MPC. In order **to justify use of deadly force to prevent felon's escape, it must be necessary measure taken where probable cause exists as to the belief that suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officers or others**
    * Use of taser is generally not considered deadly force

## Justification - Necessity Defense ("Choice of Evils")

* Necessity = Defense that otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable as it was necessary to avoid more serious harm
* MPC 3.02
  * (1) D’s otherwise criminal conduct is justifiable if:
    * D sought to avoid harm greater than the harm resulting from D’s conduct
      * Does not rely on the private judgement of D. **The harm/evil sought to be avoided must actually be greater than that from the commission of the offense, regardless of D's belief**
      * Not enough that actor beliefs conduct is sufficient to ameliorate the harm. **Must believe it was necessary to avoid the evils**
    * Statute does not explicitly preclude necessity defense
    * No obvious legislative purpose or policy reason to deny necessity defense
  * (2) Necessity NOT a defense if situation brought about by D’s reckless or negligent conduct
* CL Self-Defense (see *Unger*)
  * (1) No blame in developing the situation AND
  * (2) D reasonably believed engaging in conduct was necessary to avoid a harm greater than a resulting harm which might result from the conduct (see *Hutchins*) AND
  * (3) (split jurisdiction) Satisfying credibility factors is:
    * Required - D must notify law enforcement as soon as the threat ends (see Bailey, Unger)
    * Not Required - D does not need to notify law enforcement, factors considered holistically
  
### *People v. Unger* (1977 IL)

* Facts:  D (inmate) at minimum security prison sexually assaulted and threatened with rape. Gets anonymous phone call threating to kill him because caller (falsely) heard the D had reported it to prison authorities. D leaves the facilities and is apprehended days later several miles away
* Rule: **Justifiable by reason of necessity if the defendant was without blame in developing the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than the injury which might result from his own conduct**
* Reasoning:
  * In *Harmon*, defense of duress was held to apply in case where D alleged that he escaped to avoided repeated homosexual attacks from fellow inmates. Courts had reached similar results in escape cases involving sexual abuse under the theory of necessity
  * Court says necessity is the appropriate defense here - D was not deprived of free will by threat of harm (i.e. duress). Rather, he was **forced to chose between two imminent evils**, as supported by his testimony
  * Factors considered to determine reasonableness of necessity defense include: The threat and imminence of the threat; Opportunity to complain or seek protection through courts/law; No violence employed in the escape; and immediately reports to authorities once reaches position of safety from the threat
    * Must not satisfy all of these to assert necessity defense as matter of law, but relevant consideration
  * Under circumstances, D was entitled to jury instructions for necessity defense - he had no part in developing the situation (i.e. threats against him) and injury avoided by escaping is more harmful than the escape
* Dissent - Allowing this defense will create trouble in the future and may encourage undesirable conduct

### *United States v. Schoon* (1992 9th Cir.)

* Facts: Group of Ds gained access to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office in AZ where they protested the policy between US and El Salvador. Chanted, splashed fake blood, and generally obstructed the office’s operation. After repeated warnings to leave or face arrest by a federal police officer, group was arrested after refusing to comply. At trial, Ds proffered testimony about conditions in El Salvador as motivations for their conduct and argued that their actions were necessary to avoid further bloodshed. Judge rejected "necessity" defense and Ds were convicted
* Issue: Is the necessity defense available in indirect civil disobedience cases?
* Rule: **The necessity defense requires a defendant to show that he was faced with a choice between two related evils, that he acted to prevent imminent harm, and there was no legal alternative to violating the law. It is unavailable in indirect civil disobedience cases**
* Holding - Court holds that necessity defense was properly rejected in the trial court
  * To properly invoke the necessity defense, the defendants must have shown that (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law
  * "Civil disobedience" is the willful violation of a law, undertaken for the purpose of social or political protest. Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law or interfering with a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest
  * The mere existence of a constitutional law or governmental policy cannot constitute a legally cognizable harm. Thus, no greater harm to avert. Court must also take into consideration the likelihood that an alleged harm will be abated by the criminal action. Here, the protest alone is unlikely to change the policy towards El Salvador precisely because the act is indirect. Finally, possibility that congress could change its mind is sufficient to make lawful political action a reasonable alternative to the unlawful conduct

### *Regina v. Dudley and Stephens* (1884 UK)

* Facts: Defendants were on the crew of an English yacht. Ship wrecks and become stranded at sea for 24 days. After week without food, they kill one of the weaker crew members and fed off his body until a passing ship rescued them. Ds tried for murder of the crew member. Trial jury determined Ds would not have survived long enough to be rescued had they not done what they did. They also determined that the member that was killed also would not have survived. Ultimately unable to reach verdict
* Issue: Will the defense of necessity justify a homicide committed to save the defendants' own lives?
* Rule: **The intentional killing of another is murder unless there is some legal justification (e.g. self-defense)**
* Holding: Defendants found guilty of murder and sentenced to death (later commuted to 6 months)
  * Necessity is only a justification for murder when the killing is committed in self-defense. Thus, the defense of necessity may not be used to justify the killing of an innocent bystander.There is no authority supporting the principle that one may take the life of an innocent person to save his own
* Notes:
  * MPC Commentaries appears to endorse utilitarian approach to the "two-evils" problem. Numerical calculus to justify the intentional killing of an innocent person in order to save lives, which is lesser evil than the death of several others. This is a real life trolley problem. Direct tension between rights and maximizing lives

### *Public Committee Against Torture v. Israel* (1999 Israeli Supreme Court)

* Facts: Israeli government (D) authorized one if its national security agencies to employ physical means against those undergoing interrogation. Included sleep deprivation, shaking, forcing subjects to stay in painful positions for long amounts of time. Agency was instructed to consider urgency/severity of potential attacks and to seek alternative measures if possible. Agency argued these methods help thwart imminent terrorist attacks
* Issue: Were torture methods acceptable under the defense of "necessity" as codified in Penal Law Article 34(1), which states, "A person will not bear criminal liability for committing any act immediately necessary for the purpose of saving the life, liberty, body or property, of either himself or his fellow person, from substantial danger of serious harm, imminent from the particular circumstances, at the requisite time, and absent alternative means for avoiding the harm"?
* Holding: Methods of torture are categorically prohibited and thus unauthorized for use even under necessity exception
  * The interrogation of a suspect must "absolutely" be free of torture, free of cruel and inhuman treatment, and free of dignity-taking methods. Methods employed by the agency violated the subjects' dignity
  * While necessity exception would definitely arise in "ticking time bomb situation" where physical methods used to obtain information about imminent attack and spare innocent lives. However, question is whether the use of such physical means were authorized. The order prohibiting physical means of interrogation is made absolute and can't be justified by necessity

## Justification - Euthanasia

### *Crusan v. Missouri Dept. of Health* (1989)

* Facts - P in vegetative state following car accident and, with no chance of recovery, family requested she be removed from life support. Some evidence from past conversation P would want life support withdrawn. The hospital refused to do so without a court order. The trial court granted P's parents petition to remove the tube. Missouri Supreme Court reversed and held that the evidence of P's desire not to continue life-prolonging treatment was not clear and convincing and thus P's parents lacked the authority to effectuate the court order
* Is Missouri's evidentiary standard for establishing intent to withdraw treatment constitutionally valid?
* Holding - State evidentiary standard is valid and upheld
  * An incompetent person is not able to make informed and rational choice here. Any such right must be exercised by a surrogate
  * Here, Missouri allows surrogate to act for patient in deciding to withdraw life support
  * However, Missouri employs a procedural safeguard by requiring the  decision conform as closely to the incapacitated person's wishes as closely as possible. Thus it requires clear and convincing evidence as to the wishes of the incapacitated person
    * This procedural requirement relies on State's interest in preserving and protecting human life. There is no denying this is a valid state interest

### *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997)

* Facts: Under Washington state law, it is a crime to knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide. P, a physician, brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that the Washington state law violated a liberty interest protected by 14A. District court found that it did and CoA affirmed.
* Rule: The right to physician-assisted suicide is not a constitutionally-protected liberty interest under the 14A DPC, though jurisdictions may allow it
* Holding: Washington law banning P.A.S. is constitutional
  * Bans on P.A.S. represent those states’ commitment to the protection and preservation of all human life, a legitimate interest
  * Right to P.A.S. is not a fundamental right under the DPC - the Nation’s history and tradition has almost uniformly rejected the existence of the right, and most states continue to explicitly reject it in the present day
  * The right to P.A.S. is distinguishable from the right of competent persons to remove unwanted life-sustaining treatment recognized in *Cruzan*: the right to be free from unwanted medical procedures, at issue in *Cruzan*, is long established in national traditions upholding bodily integrity and protecting against battery, even by physicians
  * Thus, Washington legislature acted rationally in banning assisted suicide in furtherance of these legitimate objectives

## Excuse - In General

* Unlike justification, which asserts that what the excused did was appropriate or utility-maximizing, **excuse seeks to show that although the acts were harmful, they could not have been expected to do otherwise**

* We can thus characterize excuse as a defense the law allows to a wrongful action because the actor has displayed some disability or deprivation in capacity to know or choose, which renders the person either free of blame or subject to less blame
  * The disabilities that ground excuse in our law seem to fall into one of three groups:
    * Those disabilities that produce involuntary actions
      * As discussed in actus reus section, involuntary action not viewed as a culpable act at all (i.e. nothing to excuse)
    * Those that produce deficient but reasonable actions
      * There is a power to choose in a literal sense, but the choice is constrained either due to cognitive deficiency (e.g. mistake) or a volitional one (e.g. duress)
    * Those that render all actions irresponsible
      * This person could not act otherwise because they were simply not responsible moral agents at the time (e.g. insanity, infancy)

* Three most important forms of excuse: duress, intoxication, and mental disorder

## Excuse - Duress

* Duress = affirmative defense that D coerced into criminal conduct b/c (see Toscano, Contreras-Pinchon)

* MPC §2.09 – Duress
  * (1) Defense if coerced to do so by unlawful force or threat against him or another to which a person of reasonable firmness in the actor’s situation would be unable to resist
    * Threat does not necessarily have to be against the actor; could be against a relative. However, language here omits property
  * (2) Unavailable for crimes of recklessness/ negligence if actor recklessly/negligently brought about the situation
  * Remarks:
    * Possible limitations on the defense **not** in MPC
      * Requirement of imminence
      * Disallow it for murder
      * Treat it as a mitigation factor, not a total defense

* As a defense to homicide (split jurisdiction)
  * CL: No defense to homicide
  * MPC: Available in cases of homicide
  
* CL Duress
  * (1) person made "specific and imminent" threats of "serious bodily injury or death" against D or D’s family member if should D refuse to commit a crime
    * NOTE: Some jurisdictions apply it to property too (if property value outweighs harm)
  * (2) D reasonably believed the other person would carry out the threat
  * (3) D had no reasonable opportunity to prevent the threatened harm by:
    * (a) Fleeing
    * (b) Informing law enforcement
  * (4) D did NOT recklessly or negligently expose himself to the threat
    * NOTE: this element often arises if D part of criminal enterprise where threats are reasonably expected
  * (5) Crime was not homicide

* Duress distinguished from Necessity in that:
  * (1) Duress is excuse (not right, but circumstances were such that reasonable law abider might have done so) while necessity is justification (under circumstances, D took the right course of action; to do so was the lesser evil)
  * (2) Duress always involves a human threat while necessity may or may not involve human threat (e.g. could be natural condition)
  * (3) Duress D’s free will impaired while necessity D’s free will intact
  * (4) Duress furthers evil while necessity intended to avoid a greater evil to general welfare

### *State v. Toscano* (1977 NJ)

* Facts: Defendant was charged with conspiring to obtain money on false pretenses from insurance company. He agreed to do so because he owed money to a guy for gambling debts. The guy made vague threats against him and his wife. Said he filed because of fear of his life
* Rule: **Duress is defense to a crime (other than murder) if the defendant committed the crime:**
  * **(1) Because he was coerced to do so by threat or use of force**
  * **(2) Which a person or reasonable firmness in his position would have been unable to resist**
* Holding - Conviction reversed and matter remanded
  * At common law duress was recognized only when involving a use or threat of harm which is "present, imminent, and pending," and "of such a nature as to induce a well grounded  apprehension of death or serious bodily harm is the act is not done" in a man of ordinary fortitude
  * Drafters of the MPC focused on whether the standard imposed upon the accused was one with which normal members of the community will be able to comply
  * Thus under both MPC and New Jersey Penal Code, D should have had question of duress submitted to jury since his testimony that the act was committed out of fear was a factual basis for finding of duress if it could be determined that a person of reasonable firmness would have done so
* Notes:
  * Inquiry here would focus on the weaknesses and strengths of a particular defendant and his subjective reaction to unlawful demands
  * Taking into account expectations based on the defendant’s character and situation makes this approach more subjective than the reasonable person standard at common law
  * Imminence of the threat:
    * Both *Toscano* and the Model Penal Code treat the imminence of the threatened harm as one factor to be weighed by the jury in determining whether the defendant’s conduct was that of a person of reasonable firmness in his situation
    * Many common law decisions treated imminence as an absolute pre-requisite to the availability of a duress defense and some statutes expressly limited the defense to situations involving threats of instant death
    * Great majority of the recent statutory revisions have rejected the Model Penal Code’s flexible approach and preserved some requirement that the threatened harm be immediate and imminent, or instant

### *United States v. Fleming* (1957)

* Facts: POW was told to create propaganda to promote dissatisfaction among troops or be forced to march to some far away camp in the winter. Charged with aiding the enemy
* Holding: Court affirms conviction
  * Duress not available; D cooperated on mere threats of the march
  * Other soldiers had refused in similar situations, thus it doesn’t meet prong 2 (persons of reasonable firmness had resisted)
* Notes:
  * Potentially problematic application of the standard: instead of ordinary reasonable person in his situation, they seem to be using a much higher standard for soldiers
    * Would require everyone to be like John McCain

*Contreras-Pinchon* (1984 9th Cir.)

* Facts: Taxi driver from Columbia made to swallow balloons of cocaine and travel to America. He and his family were threatened in Colombia. D claimed he only did so because someone threatened to kill him and his family if he didn’t transport the drugs
* Rule: **Threat must be immediate, act must be grounded on fear of threat being realized, and there must be no reasonable opportunity for escape**
* Holding: Conviction is reversed
  * Duress is allowed because threats were serious (dealing with Colombian drug lords) and there was little rescue in Colombia (police are corrupt)
    * D was constrained by belief that police help was futile. Should be up to jury to determine whether the belief renders police help an unreasonable means of escape
* Dissent:
  * Failed to present evidence to support elements of inescapability
    * Illustrates problems for prosecutor – how can they disprove this beyond a reasonable doubt if burden is on them?

## Excuse - Intoxication

* MPC §2.08 - Intoxication
  * (1) except as in (4), intoxication not a defense unless it negatives an element of the offense
  * (2) when recklessness is mens rea, if intoxication causes actor to not be aware of a risk he would have been sober, intoxication not a defense
  * (3) intoxication not a mental disease within 4.01
  * (4) intoxication that is either (a) no self-induced or (b) pathological is a defense if by reason of intoxication the actor lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness/ criminality or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law
    * “Pathological” means intoxication much more than actor expected given the amount of the intoxicant
  * Remarks:

* Common Law - Voluntary Intoxication
  * In some jurisdictions, is not recognized at all
  * However, more common for intoxication to be relevant for determining a specific intent, but not a general intent
    * Specific intent – crime includes that actor desired some additional consequence or do some further act (e.g. assault with intent to rob)
      * You did not act with the required intent, such as, if your actions had been part of a harmless prank, then you cannot be convicted of a specific crime
      * When it does negate specific intent, you have to be more than just “disinhibited”
    * General intent – only intent in crime is with respect to the immediate act; you only need to intend your actions, not any particular result
      * Is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that you intend to cause a specific harm or end result. Must only show that intended to commit some act that the law prohibits
  * Also jurisdictions where defense only to reduce murder charge (PA statute)

* Common Law Involuntary Intoxication
  * D took substance (i) without knowledge of its intoxicating nature, (ii) under duress, or (iii) based on medical advice but unaware of intoxicating effect
    * Availability of defense (split jurisdiction):
      * (1) Treated as mental illness defense (depends on jurisdiction definition)
      * (2) Defense for culpability
      * (3) No defense for culpability (*Kingston*)

### *People v. Hood* (CA 1969)

* Facts: Heavily drunken man was resisting arrest. Grab the officers gun and shot him in the leg. Is convicted of assault with deadly weapon
* Rule: **In crimes of general intent evidence of the accused’s intoxication shall not be considered in determining guilt or innocence**
* Holding: Jury improperly instructed to consider intoxication
  * Evidence of intoxication should not relieve one of blame for simple assault or assault with a deadly weapon, crimes which frequently are committed rashly or in anger
  * In both CA and NY assault with a deadly weapon is a general intent crime

### Roberts v. People

* Facts: Man shoots another while drunk, charged with attempted murder.Allowed to include intoxication evidence to negate mens rea
* Holding:
  * **If renders him incapable of knowing what he was doing (required intent) -> not guilty**
  * If he did have the intent prior to intoxication, subsequent drunkenness is not a defense -> still responsible
  * Likewise, if held to have purposely blinded his moral perceptions and committed act intentionally without knowing it was wrong -> then still guilty

### *State v. Stasio* (NJ 1979)

* Facts: Defendant was charged with assault with attempt to rob (specific intent crime). Asserts intoxication as a defense
* Holding: NJ choses to go in a different direction -> **no admissibility of intoxication regardless of specific or general intent**, except to demonstrate premeditation and deliberation
  * Court doesn't want intoxication to be considered in a specific intent crime either because:
    * Leads to inconsistent results
    * General intent v specific intent distinction is just a guide for admitting intoxication evidence
* Dissent: an intoxicated D can’t form the necessary specific intent, so shouldn’t be held to same standard as others
* Note: States are completely non-uniform on their application of intoxication defense

### *Montana v. Egelhoff* (1996)

* Facts: D intoxicated and found with friends killed in a car. D claimed too intoxicated to remember. Montana statute for deliberate homicide required “purposely” or “knowingly” but did not allow for intoxication defense. Montana Supreme court held it unconstitutional. SCOTUS reversed (5-4, Ginsburg concurrence was the deciding vote)
* Majority (Scalia): While DPC gives right to present relevant evidence, that right is not absolute. All evidentiary rulings can have the effect of reducing the evidentiary burden of the state; doesn’t violate the principle of fairness so its not unconstitutional
  * Refusing to allow a defense of voluntary intoxication deters drunkenness, ensures people who commit crimes while intoxicated go to prison, and fits with society’s moral determination that voluntary intoxication does not excuse criminal conduct
  * Evidence of voluntary intoxication could mislead a jury

### *Regina v. Kingston* (1994 UK)

* Facts: D lures a 15-year-old boy to D's flat and then invited the defendant over to abuse the boy sexually. Person blackmailing D drugged him, then videotaped the incident to use in extortion
* Rule: **Involuntary intoxication does not negate the mens rea necessary from criminal liability**
* Holding:
  * Equates the desire with intent -> When he was engaged in the conduct he knew the boy was underage; he was not in an unconscious state but just disinhibited
    * The essential evil mental state exists; the drug only allows it to be acted upon
  * To recognize this as a complete defense would make assessing guilt in any manner involving intoxication exceedingly complex and raise a host of evidentiary problems
    * Preferable approach to involuntary intoxication is to continue to use the concept of diminished capacity, rather than create a complete defense
    * Only exception if intoxicated to the extent as to be considered insane

## Excuse - Insanity

* **Insanity** - A defense negating mens rea or affirmative defense that D committed criminal act while suffering a legally recognized abnormal mental condition
  * Two types of behavior insanity covers
    * Cognitive defect – D didn’t understand the significance of his actions
    * Behavioral defect – D couldn’t control himself
  * *Ford v. Wainwright*: Supreme Court declares that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of the insane. Court stated that the defendant must have a rational understanding rather than mere awareness of the nexus between his crime and the punishment
  * *Atkins v. Virginia*: Eighth Amendment forbids execution of people with mental retardation

* Important terms:
  * Mental Illness - Medical term referring to D’s diagnosed mental disorder, which ranges in severity and type (personality, psychotic, depression, etc)
  * Insanity - Legal term referring to D’s mental state at time of the crime that may preclude culpability
  * Incompetence - Legal term referring to D’s mental state at time of legal proceedings preventing “rational” and “factual” understanding of the proceedings against him, which may preclude ability to stand trial, undertake a responsibility, or get executed (including mentally disabled)
    * **MPC §4.04** - Competence to be Tried and Sentence: No person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures
    * **Dusky Test**: “The test must be whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding – and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.”
    * Note: Mental Illness broader than Insanity and Incompetence, so D can have mental illness and NOT be considered insane or incompetent
    * Note: D could get Insanity but not Incompetent, or vice versa

* Procedural impacts of the insanity defense
  * May not be competent to stand trial
  * Normally can’t sentence to death

* Insanity can arise at three points in the criminal process
  * (1) Mental state at the time of the commission of the criminal offense
  * (2) Incompetence to stand trial -> lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings or to assist in his own defense
  * (3) Sentencing -> can not execute the criminally insane

* Approaches for after acquittal
  * (1) Civil Commitment
    * (a) Some jurisdictions require civil commitment; others have make ad-hoc determinations -> juries in the verdict are not to be made aware of whether it is mandatory or not
    * (b) Duration -> may be released when the patient has recovered and is not longer dangerous
  * (2) Guilty but mentally ill -> court retains the same sentencing authority as in guilty verdicts, but if sentenced to prison he is to be given treatment for the illness

* Burden of Proof
  * (1) There is a presumption of legal sanity at the trial
  * (2) Level of evidence required before the presumption disappears
    * (a) Some states require only “some evidence” of legal insanity
    * (b) Others require that the evidence raise a reasonable doubt about the sanity
  * (3) Most States and the federal system require to the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is insane. 

### Different Rules and Formulations of Insanity

* Empirically speaking, formulations shown to not make much of a difference
* Should the formulation be medical or moral?
  * Criminal law about social approbation, so  latter makes more sense – also shouldn’t hinge on changing defs of medical profession
  * If it’s moral, doesn’t a phase of the trial dominated by psychiatrists just muck everything up?

* **M’Naghten Rule** - "[D acted] under such a defect of reason so as to not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, he did not know what he was doing was wrong". Regarded as most restrictive standard
  * In order to meet the burden, must show:
    * Mental disease of defect
    * Causation
    * Lacked knowledge of
      * The nature of quality of the act
      * OR the wrongness of the act (legally/morally)
  * Rudovsky example: D (Vietnam veteran) has PTSD and shoots at fireman who come to his house; D fails *M’Naghten* because knew the “wrongfulness” of shooting and “nature and quality” of shooting
  * A little under half of all jurisdictions still employ some rule similar to this

* **MPC §4.01** - ~40% of jurisdictions have adopted this instead, a more permissive test regarding insanity
  * D meets defense burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease or defect (severity and type ambiguous, though excludes abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal/anti-social conduct)
    * (2) D lacked “substantial capacity” at time of crime to either:
      * (a) Appreciate his conduct’s criminality (i.e. M’Naghten “wrongfulness” prong; but MPC leave open to moral or legal wrongfulness) OR
      * (b) Conform his conduct to the law’s requirements (i.e. volitional prong)
  * Distinguished from M'Naghten:
    * Loosens cognitive impairment (needs to appreciate right/wrong, not just know the difference)
    * Loosens volitional impairment (lack substantial capacity to conform his conduct to requirements of the law)
    * Began to fall out of favor after *Hinckley*

* **Durham Test** - First standard to question M’Naghten, but considered too broad
  * D meets burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease (NOTE: severity and type is ambiguous)
    * (2) Caused a defect of reason
    * (3) D’s crime would not have been committed but-for the abnormal mental condition (this is very broad; nothing related to knowledge of wrongfulness or the act itself)
  
* **Irresistible Impulse Test** - Question of impaired volitional ability, less restrictive than M’Naghten
  * D meets defense burden if D establishes:
    * (1) Mental disease
    * (2) Caused a defect of reason
    * (3) D unable to control his actions and follow the law

### *M'Naghten* (1843 UK)

* Facts: Defendant suffered delusions and killed a secretary to the Prime Minister. There was considerable evidence that the defendant was insane
* Question: What is the proper instruction for the jury in a case where the insanity defense is used?
* Rule: **It must be proven that at the time of the act, the accused was under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing; or if he did know, he did not know what he was doing was wrong**
* Holding: Jurors should be instructed that every man is presumed sane and to posses a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes. Therefore, in order to establish an insanity defense, it must be clearly proven that at the time of the act, the accused as under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing; or if he did know, he did not know what he was doing was wrong
* Notes Case - The King v. Porter
  * The court instructed the jury that the first thing they must do is only focus on the condition of mind at the time the act complained of was done. The next thing the jury must do is determine if the defendant’s state of mind was one of disease, disturbance, disorder. Then. Then the jury must decide that if the defendant’s state of mind was that of disease, they must decide if it was such a character to prevent him from knowing the physical nature of the act he was doing or of knowing that what he was doing was wrong

### *Blake V United States* (1969 5th Circuit)

* Background - Case where court Adopts the MPC test for insanity
* Facts: Defendant was charged with robbery. He told people he was about to rob the bank and had a history of mental illness and electro-shock therapy. The evidence overwhelmingly proved his guilt, but he offered the defense of insanity. He was convicted, but appealed by stating that the insanity definition he was convicted on did not meet the standard for was outdated. Defendant had a history of violence and erratic behavior and may have been suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the robbery. The court instructed the jury that the defendant was insane if he completely lacks capacity to know right from wrong. The jury convicted and the defendant appealed.
* Question: Was the jury instruction on insanity correct?
* Holding: No, the original insanity charge to the jury was “the term insanity as used in this defense means such a perverted and deranged condition of the mental and moral faculties as to render a person incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, or unconscious at the time of the nature of the act he is committing, or where, though conscious of it and able to distinguish between right and wrong and know the act is wrong, yet his will, by which I mean the governing power of his mind has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are to subject to it but are beyond his control.” By contrast, the MPC test for insanity which the defendant urged the court to adopt states, “A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.” The MPC definition is slightly less rigid in that lack of capacity must be substantial rather complete. This is the better formula according to the court, so the conviction was overturned.

### *United States V Lyons* (1984 5th Cir.)

* Background: Court rejects MPC requirement, reasoning that it allows too many people to plead insanity
* Facts: Lyon was convicted of twelve counts of knowingly and intentionally securing controlled narcotics. During trial, Lyons claimed his drug addiction was a mental disease within the definition proscribed in the insanity defense. He offered evidence that in 1978 he became addicted to several prescription drugs given to him for pain relief. In addition, Lyons sought to present expert witnesses who would testify that has drug addiction changed the physiology and psychology of his brain resulting an incapacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The trial court, however, excluded the proffered evidence.
* Question: Does the existing insanity defense standard of a “lack of capacity to conform one’s conduct to the requirements of the law” coincide with current medical and scientific knowledge?
* Holding: No, although addiction is not a mental disease, the addiction itself may cause actual physical damage to the brain resulting in a mental disease or defect in the brain. Defendant rightfully sought to offer such evidence to the jury. Although the court no longer recognizes the volitional prong under the insanity defense, defendant should be afforded the opportunity to offer such evidence in an attempt to satisfy the cognitive prong. A defendant in a criminal case is not guilty by reason of insanity if at the time of the conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he us unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.
* Dissent: An adjudication of guilt is not only a factual determination but a moral judgment that an individual is to blame. The court’s decision rests on its desire to redefine insanity and narrow the defense on policy considerations. Pleas of insanity and are rarely successful and do not go to trial
* Notes:
  * After the Hinckley case (guy who tried to assassinate president Reagan), many courts got rid of the MPC insanity rule because it allowed too many people to plead insanity (Only 14 states still have MPC requirement)
  * It is generally unconstitutional for a state to try and abolish the insanity defense

### *State v. Crenshaw* (1983 WA)

* Facts: While the defendant and his wife were on their honeymoon in Canada, the defendant was deported to the US.
The defendant believed that his wife was unfaithful in the few days it took for her to meet up with him back in the
112
US. Defendant brutally murdered his wife because he believed that under his religious beliefs he had to kill her if
she committed adultery. The jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder. The defendant contended that
the trial court erred in defining “right and wrong” as legal and wrong rather than in a moral sense.
* Question: Did the trial court err in defining “right and wrong” as a legal right and wrong instead of the moral sense?
* Holding: It is society’s morals and not an individuals morals that are the standard for judging moral wrong under M’Naghten. If moral wrong were judged by an individual’s conscience, the criminal law would be seriously undermined because it would allow a person in violation of the law to be excused from criminal responsibility merely because in his own conscience, his act was not morally wrong. There is evidence on the record that the defendant knew his actions were wrong according to societies standards.
* Notes:
  * Defendants who act out of a deific decree will generally have an insanity defense, although this is hotly debated because many people find this is outdated

### *State v. Guido* (1963 New Jersey)

* Facts: The victim in this case was the defendant’s husband. Her husband was a professional fighter who married her at a young age. The defendant was intimidated by her husband and felt as though she were under a constant threat of injury. There was evidence of a few instances of actual injury. The victim had an extra-marital affair and as a result the defendant wanted a divorce. The defendant called the police on several occasions prior to the incident to express her fear of her husband. On the night in question, her husband was asleep on the couch and the defendant took a gun from the living room into the bedroom in order to commit suicide. Once in the bedroom she changed her mind and decided to put the gun away. When the defendant saw her husband lying on the couch she opened fire until there were no bullets left. Defense counsel hired expert witnesses in order to put together the insanity defense. The psychiatrists initial report stated that the defendant was legally sane at the time of the incident. After debate with defense counsel, the psychiatrist agreed to change their opinion as to the legal sanity issue. However, their underlying medical findings remained the same. The psychiatrist thought that only psychosis was what qualified as a disease of the mind.
* Question: What constitutes “a disease of the mind” under the concept of legal insanity?
* Holding: There is widespread reluctance to define what is meant by “disease” under the M’Naghten rule. Because there is no concrete definition, the definition of what constitutes legal insanity is up for discussion. In this case, the defendant emotional insanity met the definition of disease of the mind.
* Notes:
  * Courts define “disease of the mind” differently, some give a broad standard that includes many types of insanity (i.e. emotional) and others give more limited definitions
  * It must be a disease however, and this requirement has defeated insanity claims for battered woman syndrome, compulsive gambling disorder, postpartum disorders, alcohol and drug addictions, and others

### *Clark v. Arizona* (2006)

* Facts: During a traffic stop, defendant shot and killed a police officer, and was prosecuted for first-degree murder. Clark admitted the shooting but brought his paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident as a defense, to prove that he did not have the specific intent to shoot an officer of the law the knowledge that he was committing the specific crime. The trial court ruled that the defendant could not use evidence showing that he was insane to rebut the presence of mens rea. Thus psychiatric evidence could not be admitted to prove the absence of specific intent, or of mens rea, defendant was convicted. Defendant pleaded a violation of his due process of law
* Question: Does a state violate a due process of law by preventing the introduction of evidence showing diminished capacity by a criminal defendant?
* Holding: No, a state’s prohibition of the introduction of diminished mental capacity by the defendant in a criminal case does not violate due process. A defendant is presumed sane until he proves otherwise, but allowing a defendant to use evidence of insanity to show that he could not form the necessary criminal intent would enable him to get around that presumption. “Clark presses no objection to Arizona’s decision to require persuasion to clear and convincing degree before the presumption of sanity. And normal responsibility.” But if a state is to have authority in practice as well in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the presumption of sanity more easily when addressing a different issue in the course of the criminal trial
* Dissent: Defendant should be allowed to introduce evidence of his lack of awareness or intent to commit the specific crime he is charged with, provided it is reliable and thought-through, so that that he can prove he cannot be convicted of either knowingly or voluntarily killing a police officer. The final placing of the burden of proof on the defendant as to his intent or knowledge of the crime he was committing is unconstitutional as the state has the responsibility of proving these elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt
* Notes:
  * *United States v. Brawner*: Establishes the Brawner Approach, evidence about D’s mental condition at the time of the crime is admissible to negate a required specific intent but not a general intent
  * Many states impose no special restrictions on the use of mental-health evidence to rebut a required mens rea
    * 16 state bar evidence of mental illness to negate culpability elements of any kind, 13 states permit mental illness to negate only specific intent, and 23 jurisdictions allow mental-illness evidence to negate any element (this is the MPC Approach)
    * MPC Approach: Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense
    * The MPC approach permits the use of mental health evidence to rebut a required mens rea, but for cases when the elements of an offense are proved, the MPC rejects a statutory reduction of punishment for reduced mental capacity
