# Attempt and Causation

## Causation

### General Overview

* Determination of causation is par of the actus reus analysis
  * It links the “voluntary act” of the actus reus and the resulting social harm
* Issue of causation appears primarily in homicide cases. Occasionally appears in non-homicide cases, but almost always related to homicide
* Causation is Mainly a Retributive Concept
  * There’s no reason why D should not be responsible for V’s death if we can prove that, had X not intervened, D’s bullet surely would have killed V. The act seems just as culpable. From an deterrence/incentive side, it doesn’t make sense to under charge to 'attempted murder'
  * Role of causation finds it primary moral justification in retributive just deserts. Given the stakes of criminal convictions, the principle of causation is an instrument society employs to ensure that criminal responsibility is personal
* As in tort law, causation has two constituent parts that must be satisfied: **But-for causation** and **proximate causation**
  * Criminal law causation is in no way linked to Tort law and its underlying doctrines and standards related causation
    * Different aims. Tort law causation attempts to place liability on the party who's conduct is most culpable for P's harm (apportionment). Criminal law is concerned with the level of culpability necessary to justify punishment (deterrence and retribution)
    * The severe consequences that follow from criminal liability provide a strong argument for a stricter standard of causation than that in tort law
* Most state codes include no explicit rules for determining causation. In these jurisdictions, courts are left to decide based on evolving common law principles
  * MPC §2.03 seeks to articulate an appropriate standard and roughly a dozen states have adopted it

### But-For Causation

### Proximate Causation - Components and Approaches

* Most causation problems present issues related to only proximate causation
  * Examples of these problems: Intervening causes of nature, third parties, etc.
* The purpose of the but-for test of causation is to identify the candidates for responsibility for an event. From this pool, which may include other human actors and non-human forces stemming over an extended period of time, the “proximate” cause of the social harm must be selected
  * The proximate cause analysis is concerned with two primary questions:
    1. When is the intervening conduct – of a third party, the victim, or a natural force – sufficiently out of the ordinary that it is no longer fair to say that the social harm was caused by the Defendant’s conduct?
    1. Put differently, under what circumstances should D, who acts with the requisite mens rea, and who commits a voluntary act that is but-for causation of a social harm, be relieved of criminal responsibility because of an intervening proximate cause?
* There are two situations where proximate cause is present:
  1. Direct Proximate Cause – When D shoots V and V dies instantly or soon after, it’s pretty clear that the shooting was a direct cause of death. An act that is a direct cause of social harm is also a proximate cause of it
  1. Intervening Proximate Causes – An intervening cause is an independent force – another but-for cause – that operates in producing the social harm after the defendant’s voluntary act has been committed
* Transferred Intent
  * D shoots at V1 intended to kill him, but bullet misses and ricochets. It strikes and kills V2. Is D guilty of murder regardless of foreseeability?
    * All jurisdictions say D is guilty, reasoning that the intent to kill V1 transfers to his action that ultimately harmed V2
      * Has the same blameworthy mental state and blameworthy result
  * MPC would also convict D in this situation, holding a person is guilty of intentionally causing a certain result even if it accidentally inflicts the harm on a person while intentionally trying to inflict it on another
  * Problems
    * If D succeeds in inflicting harm on intended person while harming another person in the process, is the intent still transferred or is it "used up"
    * If D shoots at V1 intending to kill and V2 kills pedestrian with car while trying to escape, is the intent tran sferred to this scenario?

### Proximate Cause Cases

* *People v Acosta* (1991) (CA Appel)
  * Facts: Intense car chase. In pursuit, two police helicopters crash killing the pilots. Is D responsible?
  * Holding - But for causation is clear, but proximate causation would depend on foreseeability. Trier of fact's finding of proximate cause was appropriate based on objective standard of reasonableness
  * Reasoning
    * Proximate cause is term historically used to separate those results for which actor will be held responsible from those not carrying such responsibility. Legal fiction serving matters of policy based partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice
    * If not a factual cause (but-for), then no need to even consider proximate causation
    * Standard for proximate cause should exclude extraordinary results and allow the trier of fact to sense of common man (objective)
    * In choosing to engage in high-speed escape from police, within D's reasonable apprehension that the police may be harmed in the pursuit
    * **Since the result was possible consequences that could have been reasonably contemplated, a finding of proximate cause is appropriate**
* *People v. Brady* (2005) (CA Appel)
  * Facts - D recklessly started a fire in meth lab.  Two firefighting planes went to fight fire, but one pilot made an error and the planes collided, killing both pilots. D convicted of causing both deaths, D argued not sufficient cause
  * Holding - Deaths foreseeable given location of the fire (it would require extraordinary efforts to control it)
* *State v. Muro* (2005) (Neb CoLR)
  * Facts - D came home and found daughter w/ a fractured skull.  D waited 4 hours before seeking medical attention. D convicted of causing daughter’s death by failing to seek immediate medical attention
  * Holding - D **criminally liable ONLY if established beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct is the cause in-fact of victim’s death**. Only the possibility of survival existed with earlier treatment, thus no but-for beyond reasonable doubt. D wins on appeal
* *Burrage v U.S.* (2014) (SCOTUS)
  * Facts: 20 year mandatory minimum for distributing drugs that lead to death. V dies and cocktail of mixed drugs found in autopsy. Expert testimony that heroin sold by D was a contributing factor in the death, as it was part of the mix of drugs. Possible V could still have died without the heroin
  * Holding: SCOTUS holds that there’s no but-for causation because it’s not certain that D's conduct was an independently sufficient cause. Uncertain about precisely how much the chance of death increased as a result of the heroin. **Uncertainty of this type cannot be reconciled with beyond a reasonable doubt standard.**
* *People v. Arzon* (1978) (NY Appel)
  * Facts:D intentionally set fire on fifth floor of abandoned building. Firefighters respond to fire that D started at which point an independent fire is discovered on the second floor. Second floor fire kills firefighter attempting to evacuate building. D indicted for arson and second-degree murder (based on recklessness evincing depraved disregard for human life). D argued no causal link between the fifth floor fire and the fireman’s death
  * Holding: Court upholds finding that **D was responsible because conduct was but-for cause and ultimate harm should have been reasonably foreseen. Ultimate harm need not be intended by actor, so long as harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to the conduct. Irrelevant that it ws not sole and exclusive factor in V's death or that intervening factor contributed to ultimate harm. Result was certainly foreseeable that fire set would expose responders to life-threatening risk**
* Warner Lambert (1980) (NY CoLR)
  * Facts - D’s gum factory explodes killing workers b/c D failed to take safety precautions; D acquitted of second-degree manslaughter. D’s convicted of IVM (negligence), but D’s argue no criminal culpability
  * Holding  - D **conduct must be “sufficiently direct cause” of victim’s death because criminal negligence requires higher standard (beyond reasonable doubt) than civil negligence**
* *State v. Shabazz* (CT 1998)
  * Facts - D fatally stabbed victim, but victim died from malpractice while being treated at hospital
  * Holding - D criminally liable if D’s despite other contributing factors including negligence on behalf of the hospital treating V. **Gross negligence by a third party is only a defense when the negligence is the sole cause of the death**. At most, the hospital's negligence can be viewed as a contributing factor. Had V been in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery when the malpractice occurred, then this would likely be a valid defense
* *United States v. Main* (1997) (9th CC)
  * Facts - D (police officer) failed to move an injured victim who then died from asphyxiation. D convicted of IVM
  * Holding - Causation is a matter of fact for the jury, including judgment about morality and culpability related to medical treatment errors. It was inappropriate for trial judge to refuse instructing jury about proximate cause.
