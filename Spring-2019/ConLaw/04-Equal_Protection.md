# Equal Protection

## Classifications Based on Race or National Origins

### *Strauder v. West Virginia* (1879)

* Facts - WV law only allowed white male citizens of State over 21 to serve as jurors. Strauder convicted and sentenced for murder by an all white male jury. He moved to remove into Federal Court on the grounds that, having been a slave, he had reason to believe h could not have full and equal benefit of laws/proceedings of state
* Question: (1) Does Constitution afford every citizen right of trial by jury selected without discrimination against his race or color and on the basis of race or color; and (2) if he has such a right and it is denied, may he remove case to federal court?
* Outcome - Right to have a jury not discriminating against ones’ race or color is affirmed, as is right of removal because of the clear constitutional conflicts
* Rule - **Object of 14A EPC is absolute equality of two races before the law, which includes necessary right of colored race for freedom from legal discriminations**
* Majority Reasoning:
  * Pervading Purpose - Spirit and meaning of 14A is to give blacks equal civil rights
    * 14A was "designed to ensure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government whenever that enjoyment should be denied by the states"
    * Note that Courts' construction of 14A only applies to races; can discriminate against women
  * Cannot deny class full enjoyment of laws by having jury prejudiced against that class. EPC denies states the power to withhold equal protections of laws from persons of color. However, Law expressly disadvantages blacks
    * The fact that blacks are singled out and expressly denied participation in the administration of the law despite their citizenship is an assertion of their inferiority and stimulant to prejudice which impedes the equal justice the law is intended to secure
    * White men are entitled to jury selected without discrimination against his race, yet colored men are not. This is inequality
  * Even if political rights not within scope of EPC, civil rights are implicated with this law
Dissent - Not a denial of equal protection because 14A only protects civil rights
  * Political – Jury service, voting
  * Civil – Rules of evidence, Right to contract, property, standing to sue
  * Social – Ordinary social interaction or intercourse of the people (e.g. being treated in proper station)
Notes - Are political rights outside EPC [interpretive modalities], and if so, what are these rights?
  * If right to vote is indeed protected by 14A, then big surplusage problem because 15A not needed then
    * Can’t just be right to vote, but this leads to inference that all political rights would be removed from 14A
  * Promotes the interest of blacks; broad language includes other groups like Irish & Chinese
    * Language may be even broader than race or ethnicity

### *Korematsu v. United States* (1945)

* Facts: Exclusion orders required Japanese Americans to (1) depart area, (2) report to assembly center, and (3) remain in relocation center under military control. Korematsu did not depart out of fear of being detained, thus violated the first order. Challenges the constitutionality of the exclusion orders as a defense
* Outcome - Actions taken under the law were not unjustified and the Order is valid. The orders involving the detention of Japanese Americans were not addressed since that is not the alleged violation here
* Rule - **Constitutional restrictions on civil rights based on racial classifications must be subject to rigid scrutiny, but may be upheld in cases of pressing public necessity**
* Majority Reasoning
  * Starts off by acknowledging that **legal restrictions which curtail civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect and must be subjected to most rigid scrutiny**. Racial antagonism is never justified
    * Extends EPC to not just white and black, but all races
  * Orders must be looked at separately since they impose distinct duties, thus the focus is only on the violation of the first order related to evacuation
    * Evacuation order is similar to *Hirabayashi* where curfew was upheld as a defense measure for military. It was justified on the grounds that it was necessary to prevent spying and sabotage; protect dangerous situations
    * Can't say as a matter of law or fact that evacuating to assembly facility would have resulted in long term detention at a relocation center. Thus, his justification for violating the first order is unfounded
  * D was excluded from area not because of hostility towards race, but because of war with Japan and legitimate fear of invasion that prompted military to take necessary security measures. Congress, expressing confidence in them, determined military leaders should have power to do this during war time
    * Overinclusiveness of the law is okay because unascertained number of disloyal Japanese
* Dissent (Murphy) - Essential that there be definite limits to military discretion. Test for military deprivation: whether deprivation is reasonably related to an immediate, imminent, and impending public danger
  * No racial classifications that disadvantage racial minorities
  * Most Rigid scrutiny -> Ends = Compelling; Means = Reasonably related
  * Bad assumption to say all persons of Japanese ancestry have dangerous tendencies
  * Hugely over and under-inclusive, but Murphy wrong to say no reasonable relation
  * Gets equal protection preventing racial discrimination in 5A from “spirit of Amendments”
* Dissent, Jackson - Courts should not decide these cases at all because military will always win
  * Cannot allow the Courts to be used as a tool for the military
  * Guilt is not inheritable, thus basis of exclusion on parents place of origin conflicts with principles underlying constitution
* Notes
  * This is a 5A case since it is not based on state law. 5A is relevant here because liberty is being deprived. However, 5A also has some equal protection force implied
  * Although Court deferential to military in times of war, these are when rights need the most protection from pressure and hysteria

### *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)

* Facts - LA law mandates separate but equal railcars for the white and colored races for all railroad comps. Plessy was 1/8 black, 7/8 white and refused to sit in colored car after being ordered. Plessy challenges the act asserting that it conflicts with both the 13th amendment and the 14th amendment
* Outcome - Law authorizing or even requiring separation of two races in public place not unreasonable exercise of state police powers
* Rules
  * Majority formal equality rule – Mus provide formal (de jure) equality and also do not purposely communicate or enforce badges of inferiority
  * Dissent anti-subordination rule – Regardless of intent, do not act in any way that (predictably) reinforces inferiority/castes/classes
* Majority Reasoning - If one race is inferior to the other socially, the US Constitution cannot put them on the same plane -> Two races meeting on social equality must do so by mutual appreciation
  * Clearly no violation of 13A - legal distinction does not re-establish state of involuntary servitude
  * Court interprets 14A(5) as authorizing only to provide redress or correcting effects of hostile state legislation. It does not permit direct legislation on matters related to that which the states are prohibited from making/enforcing
    * Thus, exercise of 14A must be predicated upon state laws that violate 14A and directed to the correction of their operation/effects
  * Intention of 14A was clearly to enforce absolute equality of two races between the law and protect against hostile state legislation, however **requiring/permitting separating races in places of likely friction does not necessarily imply inferiority and has been recognized as within competency of state's exercise of police powers so long as they are reasonable and enacted in good faith** (as opposed to the annoyance or oppression of a particular class)
    * Must give large discretion to state legislature in determining reasonableness. State is at liberty to act with reference to established usages/customs/traditions with a view to the promotion of their comfort and the preservation of public order and peace
    * Can't say this separation is unreasonable under this standard
  * Distinction between laws interfering with political equality and those requiring separation in public places has been drawn by Court
    * **Law can’t be for the purpose of creating inferiority, but there is no constitutional issue if the law has the effect of enforcing inferiority**
      * Separate but equal schools are okay because they don’t necessarily imply inferiority of a race
    * Law cannot abolish social distinctions based upon color or enforce social equality (rather than political) upon two races
      * Not the role of the courts to impose social values upon people under guise of Constitution
    * Saying this law stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority is a construction that the colored race themselves chooses to put upon the law
* Dissent (Harlan) - Everyone knows this law stamps a badge of inferiority upon the colored race
  * Cannot arbitrarily separate citizens on the basis of race because inconsistent with equality
  * Law has meaning of arousing race hate, perpetuating distrust, and degrading. Underlying purpose is based on the inferiority of the colored race
  * Cannot act, under guise of giving equal accommodations, to compel blacks to keep to themselves
  * Two strands in Harlan’s dissenting opinion
    1. No superior, dominant ruling class of citizens -> No social hierarchy or caste
    1. The Constitution is colorblind -> Can’t account for races at all; Amendments removed the race line from our government system and put races on equal footing
* Notes
  * Too much talk of inferiority in the majority to think they only require formal equality
  * Different from *Strauder* because the law in *Strauder* treated blacks different than whites

### *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954)

* Facts - Black students sought aid of the courts in obtaining admission to public schools on a non-segregated basis within their community. This segregation was alleged to deprive Ps of equal protection of the laws under 14A
* Outcome - Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal; later argument for de-segregation plan
* Rule - **The doctrine of separate but equal has no place in the field of public education. Where physical segregation enforced on the basis of race necessarily commands inequality under the law, regardless of tangible factors being equal, any state law attempting to effectual such enforcement is unconstitutional**
* Unanimous Opinion - Relied on psychological effects on black students unlikely ever to be undone
  * Cannot solve constitutionality of segregation on Framers’ intent because inconclusive and there has been enormous change in nature of education making history of little use
  * Can’t depend on equality among resources and tangible factors when looking for inequality in the education context; education and its role in society is constantly evolving, thus effects of segregation extend far beyond educational facilities
  * Public education important because (1) foundation of good citizenship; (2) awakens the child to culture value; and (3) prepares children for later professional training
    * Thus, **where state has undertaken opportunity to provide education, it is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms**
  * State mandated segregation inherently stamps black children as inferior and impairs their educational opportunities, thus **separate educational facilities are inherently unequal**
* Notes
  * Doesn’t quite overrule *Plessy* because holding only applies to public education
    * Seems to turn on importance of public education, though an argument could be made that this badge inferiority could extend to many other contexts
    * Post-Brown per Curiams seem to extend beyond education (e.g. public beaches, golf courses, buses, courtroom seating, etc.)
  * Connecting the holding of this case to the Constitution
    * Legal premise = No promoting racial subordination / No castes / Const. is colorblind
    * Factual premise = Racially segregated schools impose stigma on minority children and create disparate educational outcomes
    * Holding = separate but equal has no place in public education
    * Possible legal premise might also be “treat races formally equally.”
    * Interpretive modalities that may be used to get to the legal premise
      * Framers’ intent – withr/t specific practices or constitutional principles [different levels]
      * Framers’ purpose – purpose is more general or ultimate [distinct from motivations]
        * Motive is separate, and is considered “the” ultimate
        * Purpose describes state of affairs; intent used as a means to reach purpose
  * Note that we have not yet reached the point of applying strict scrutiny
* Brown 2: Courts issue remedy, though unclear what exactly was required
  * Possible interpretations:
    * School's are required to end de jure segregation
    * Schools required to maintain a racially integrated and diverse student body (i.e. de facto desegregation)
  * It ultimately turned out to be the middle ground - Schools that were found to have enforced de jure segregation were required to eliminate all vestiges. Those schools that had not been segregating had no affirmative obligations

## Tiers of Scrutiny and Modern Framework

* Discriminatory classifications - Two types
  * (1) Classification exists on the face of the law or
  * (2) Discriminatory impact or effect and purpose of the law
* Factors for choosing level of scrutiny
  * Discrete and insular minority
  * Immutable characteristics
  * Ability of group to protect self through political process
  * History of prejudice and discrimination
* In evaluation of a law, focus on both the ends and the means by looking at the degree of fit
  * Only concerned with whether a fact finder could have thought rationally related…not actually
  * Any heightened scrutiny requires actual justifications rather than hypothetical justifications

### Rational Basis

* Rational Basis Test - The minimal level of scrutiny that all government actions challenged under equal protection must meet
  * Default level of scrutiny. Unless the government action is the type that warrants intermediate or strict scrutiny, rational basis review is used
  * One who assails the classification in such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary
    * Constitutional safeguard is offended only if classification rests on grounds irrelevant to achievement of State's objective
  * There is a strong presumption in favor of laws that are challenged under rational basis review. It is difficult for a law to fail this test, though it is possible (see *Romer*)
    * If law does not employ suspect classifications or impinge on fundamental rights, there must be clear arbitrariness or irrationality in order to violate EPC
    * Virtually any goal that is not forbidden by the constitution will be deemed to sufficient to meet rational basis test
* **Legitimate Purpose** - Must be legitimate government interest
  * Under rational basis review of a law, the **actual purpose is irrelevant. The law must be upheld if facts support any reasonably conceived justification**
    * That Congress or state legislature "could have believed" is sufficient and those attacking thus have burden to negate every conceivable justification for the discrimination
  * Traditional police powers - advances traditional purpose of protecting safety, public health, and public morals
    * Public morals
      * In *McGowan v. Maryland*, law prohibiting businesses to be closed on Sundays is upheld. Uniform day of rest to spend time with family and community is sufficient interest
      * Some moral justifications cannot satisfy requirement. *Romer v. Evans* – Can’t pass law preventing future laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination because no legitimate interest in harming politically unpopular group
  * Economic effects
    * Limited by dormant commerce and privileges & immunities clauses (See limitations below)
    * *Metropolitan Life Insurance* - Law imposing higher tax on out-of-state insurance companies was unconstitutional. Improving economy at expense of out-of-staters was not legitimate purpose
  * Limitations
    * Cannot be bare legislative desire to harm politically unpopular group
    * Cannot infringe 1A or favor in-state over out-of-state businesses
* **Reasonably Related** - Classification is reasonably related to the interest
  * Not concerned with actual closeness of fit, but **whether legislators could have reasonably believed that the classification would further the interest**
  * Deference in finding rational relationship - only overruled where clearly wrong and arbitrary
  * Tolerance of underinclusiveness, overinclusiveness, or both
    * Laws are **underinclusive** when they do not regulate all who are similarly situated
      * Raises concerns that government has enacted law that only targets politically powerless group or exempts those with more influence
      * Has been tolerated on basis that government often needs to take incrementalist approach, addressing problem most acute to the legislative mind
    * Laws are **overinclusive** if it regulates individuals who are not similarly situated, thus covers more people than needed to accomplish its purpose
      * Concern that it is unfair to those unnecessarily regulated and leaves politically powerless more vulnerable
      * Has been tolerated on grounds that alternative measures are less precise or more costly
  * Cannot be an arbitrary and unreasonable law
    * Court has struck down laws for being based on nothing other than irrational prejudices
    * These are cases where classifications schemes have no reasonable relationship with the interest they are intended to advance, thus legislators could not have believed this was not arbitrary
* Issues
  * Consistency of the court in applying the test
  * Argument that the Court has gone too far in its deference under this standard, as some legitimate purpose can be identified in nearly every law
    * Argument that we should only look at the actual purpose, but this is difficult to ascertain and a single legislative purpose often doesn't exist

### Intermediate Scrutiny

* Standard: Must be substantially related to an important government interest
  * Ends = important
  * Means = substantially related
* Classifications based on gender and nonmarital children

### Strict Scrutiny

* Standard: Necessary (or narrowly tailored) to achieve a compelling government interest
  * Ends = compelling
  * Means = necessary or narrowly tailored
    * Least restrictive alternative
* Classifications based on race, national origin, and aliens
  * *Fisher v. UT Austin* - "Judicial review must begin from the position that any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect"
* “Strict in theory, fatal in fact”, though not so much after *Bakke* and *Grutter*
* Theories behind strict scrutiny
  * Evidentiary – Something akin to the “smoking out” illegitimate purposes rationale from Justice O’Connor in *Grutter*. A law will only pass this test if actually tailored to something compelling, thus putting suspicions about pretextual purposes to rest
  * Justificatory - Some classifications can lead to substantial injury to historically disadvantaged classes. Since costs are greater, justification should be stronger. Strict scrutiny helps determine whether the purpose is of sufficient purpose to justify costs

## Race-Neutral Laws With Racially Disparate Effects

* Overview of Framework
  * Law facially race-neutral, but racially discriminatory impact is so unequal that it is determinative of intent -> apply strict scrutiny (*Yick Wo*)
  * Law facially race-neutral, but racially discriminatory impact -> ask whether there was racially discriminatory purpose
    * If no, then apply rational basis
    * If yes, then was purpose a but-for motivation?
      * If no, then apply rational basis
      * If yes, then apply strict scrutiny
  
* Some laws that are facially race neutral are administered in a manner that discriminates against minorities or has a disproportionate impact against them. Court has held that there **must be proof of a discriminatory purpose** in order for such laws to be treated as racial or national origin classifications
  * Laws that are facially neutral on matters of race/national origin will only receive rational basis review unless this proof is met
  * *Washington v. Davis* (1976) – Facially neutral laws with discriminatory impacts must have proof of discriminatory purpose to be treated as a racial classification receiving strict scrutiny - "discriminatory impact, standing alone, does not trigger...strictest scrutiny"
  * Justification
    * EPC is concerned with prohibiting government's discriminatory acts rather than bringing equal rights. *Mobile v. Bolden* - Only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the EPC
    * Allowing impact to suffice in proving racial classification would potentially invalidate a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and blacks than they are to whites
  * Note - Some civil rights laws provide that discriminatory impact alone can prove violation of that respective law, but this is not so for EPC
  
* Some laws that are facially race neutral have a clear discriminatory purpose, but fail to have a discriminatory impact. This raises question about whether the discriminatory effect is also required to achieve strict scrutiny?
  * According to the Court, the answer is yes. **Need both proof of discriminatory impact and purpose in order to achieve strict scrutiny**
    * *Palmer v. Thompson* (1971) - Suggests discriminatory purpose, alone, is insufficient to prove that a facially neutral law constitutes a race or national origin classification. Can't strike down law solely on basis of motives by those who voted for it
    * *US v. Armstrong* (1996) – Declares EPC challenge of race neutral law needs proof of both discriminatory effect and purpose
  
* How to prove discriminatory purpose
  * Must show that it desired to discriminate, not that it merely knew it would have these consequences. Must be because of, not in spite of
* Two-steps in establishing the proof necessary for strict scrutiny
  1. Plaintiff must show a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose
     * Need not show this was dominant or primary purpose, but merely that it as motivating factor
  1. Burden shifts to the government to prove that the discriminatory purpose is not a but-for cause of the action
     * Must show it would have taken the action even if the impermissible purpose had not been considered
  * *Arlington Heights* (1977) – Supreme Court explained different ways to prove a discriminatory purpose:
    * Impact of the law is so discriminatory as to allow no other explanation than that it was adopted for impermissible purposes
      * Example: In *Yick Woo* law was applied so unequally for a particular class of individuals, it warranted conclusion that regardless of legislative intent, the law was administered by state with mind so unequal and oppressive that it amounted to practical denial of equal protection. Pattern is so stark that impact alone is determinative of purpose
    * History surrounding the government’s actions
    * Legislative or administrative history of the law

## Benign Racial Classification to Benefit Historically Disadvantaged Groups

* Key themes and takeaways
  * **Diversity is a compelling interest in education and universities may use race as a factor to ensure diversity, but quotas or numerical quantification of benefits is impermissible**
    * First articulated by Powell in *Bakke* and later adopted/adhered to in *Grutter*
  * Affirmative action or "benign" racial classification is **NOT permissible when the purpose is**:
    * To remedy long history of racism throughout society
    * To provide role models in society or to enhance services to minority communities (e.g. healthcare argument from *Bakke*)
  * **Judicial review must begin from the position that nay official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect**
    * Powell argues for strict scrutiny in *Bakke*, *Grutter* reaffirmed this by reviewing under strict scrutiny to smoke out illegitimate uses, and applied in *Fisher* so that government bears burden of proving the reasons for classifications are identified and legitimate
    * Pro-Strict Scrutiny arguments in affirmative action - Any race divisions create hostility/resentment and danger of stigmatic harm; government required to treat equally regardless of race
    * Anti-Strict Scrutiny arguments in affirmative action - Long history of racism/discrimination against minorities but not white. Reaching social equality and closing disparities requires remedial action. There is also difference between majority discriminating against itself and against the minority

### *Regents of University of CA v. Bakke* (1978)

* Facts - White male denied admission to UC Davis Med. School while others with lesser credentials specially admitted due to their race or ethnicity. 16 seats in class of 100 reserved for Blacks, Chicanos, Asians and American Indians
  * Parties disagree over degree of judicial scrutiny warranted and purpose of the admissions program
    * California - Strict scrutiny should be reserved for classifications that disadvantaged discrete and insular minorities. Admissions program establishes goal of diverse student body
    * Bakke - Strict scrutiny because degree of scrutiny is not contingent on being in a discrete and insular minority. Personal rights are being deprived on the basis of racial classification. Admissions program is a quota
* Outcome:
  * Admissions program violated Title VI (5-4): Powell (arguing it failed strict scrutiny) and conservative plurality (statutory grounds only)
  * Race can be considered as factor in admissions (5-4): Powell and liberal plurality
  SCOUTS holds the admissions scheme violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Court also rules that race may be used as a factor more generally in the application process
* Rule - **There may be no quota, but race may be used as a factor more generally in application**
* Powell Opinion
  * Title VI extends to limit of EPC and the EPC calls for strict scrutiny
  * Agrees with Baake: all racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, not just members of a discrete and insular minority. If groups not accorded the same protection on basis of race, then not equal. Entitled to judicial protection against classifications of race because they impinge his personal rights, not because he is a member of a specific group. This is needed for consistent application of consitutional standards
    * Rejects argument that discrimination against white majority can't be suspect if purpose is benign. There is inherent unfairness here that is being prescribed on the basis of race
    * Not judicially manageable to determine which groups require heightened scrutiny and which don't
    * **Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and call for strictest scrutiny** (5-4 vote on this assertion)
  * Strict scrutiny standard - Classification must be precisely/narrowly tailored to serve compelling government interest. Government must show that:
    1. **Interest/purpose is both constitutionally permissible and substantial (compelling)**
    1. **Use of classification is necessary to accomplice purpose of safeguarding this interest (narrowly tailored)**
  * Court considers each of the interests the admissions scheme purports to serve:
    * No legitimate interest to have a specific percentage of a race in the class - preference for no reason other than race is discrimination for its own sake
    * No interest in ameliorating effects of discrimination - university in no position to decide and remedy societal, past de jure discrimination
    * No evidence that program is even geared to promote goal of aiding underserved health communities (needs to be an actual purpose with interest)
    * **Interest in a diverse student body is compelling** and constitutionally permissible
      * Race and ethnicity only one element of diversity, however
  * Court hen considers if classification is narrowly tailored to the interest
    * **Not narrowly or precisely tailored and is both over and underinclusive, so fails strict scrutiny**
      * Can consider race/ethnicity as factor when all vie for the same seats, but cannot reserve seats on the sole basis of race. Must treat each applicant as an individual. To foreclose from consideration on the basis of race because all reserved spots have been filled fails to do this
        * Whites are excluded from consideration for a fixed percentage of available seats based on nothing other than race
        * This is equivalent of facial intent to discriminate, and since a holistic approach would achieve the same end (diversity) without doing this, the classification fails the test of necessity
* Concurrence/Dissent (Brennan + 3 Justices)
  * Whites as a class do not have any of the traditional indicia of suspectness, so apply intermediate scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny
  * State may adopt race-conscious programs if the purpose is to remove disparate racial impacts its actions might otherwise have or due to past discriminations
    * Impossible to do this in a racially neutral way, so appropriately tailored
  * The admissions scheme is acceptable under Title VI = EPC; race can be used
* Concurrence/Dissent (Stevens + 3 Justices )-
  * Avoid constitutional questions where avoidable, and here we have a statutory means
  * Special admissions policy excludes π on basis of race and violates Title VI
  * Never reaches the question of using race in admissions under EPC
* Notes - Title VI passed under the spending power of Congress; conditional spending grant
  * Strict scrutiny still being formulated here: “precisely tailored” but also permissible and substantial interest substituted for compelling
  * Not yet clear what level of scrutiny will apply in affirmative action cases
  * Focus is only enlightenment with robust exchange of ideas provoking confrontation

### *Grutter v. Bollinger* (2003)

* Facts - White female application with 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT rejected from Michigan Law. Michigan Law admissions looks at applications individually; race considered as a factor
* Outcome - EPC does not prohibit Law School’s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions
* Rule - Compelling interest in obtaining educational benefits flowing from diverse student body
  * **Flexible, nonmechanical admissions program with individualized consideration is a narrowly tailored plan satisfying strict scrutiny**
* Majority, O’Connor - All racial classifications imposed by the government are subject to strict scrutiny
  * All racial classifications are inherently suspect
    * Apply strict scrutiny to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring government pursuit of a goal important enough to warrant a highly suspect tool
    * Applies strict scrutiny even for majority because we cannot tell whether a law is really benign or not (not judicially manageable)
  * Strict scrutiny standard - **Must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest**
    * Constitutional precept – do not racially discriminate absent great need
    * This does not guarantee being struck down as unconstitutional
  * Obtaining education benefits flowing from diverse student body is a **compelling interest**
    * Essential to educational mission and robust exchange of ideas
    * Business success depends on exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, views
    * Need openness and integrity in education training given lawyer’s societal importance
    * Visibility – Positions of leadership appear open to all domains of people in order to retain legitimacy
  * Law school's admissions plan **bears hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan**
    * **Must remain flexible enough to ensure each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes race ethnicity the defining feature of her application**
    * Here, there is individualized consideration to applicants of all races. Diversity factors other than race taken into account, such as life stories and personal background. This is consistent with Powell's description of a permissible holistic program in *Bakke*
    * Gives deference to Law School's selection of this method over possible racially neutral alternatives and intermittently reviewing the necessity of the program in the future (satisfies durational requirement)
* Concurrences (Ginsburg) - Cannot sunset affirmative action because we can only hope for improvement of race relations, not firmly forecast
* Dissent (Scalia) - No compelling interest to maintain prestige of law school
  * Constitution prohibits government discrimination on basis of race
  * Benefits provided by diversity are not unique to an educational context
  * Discriminatory questions now center on individuality focus, good faith efforts of admissions committee, and zealous pursuit of reaching “critical mass” – too subjective
* Dissent (Thomas)
  * Fredrick Douglas – a black man who cannot stand on their own legs should be let to fall
  * Agrees that (1) further use of race in admissions unlawful and (2) not compelling in 25 yr
  * Demeans everyone to place citizens on racial register;
  * Compelling interest is educational benefits, but no real improvements made w/ program
    * Only interests are (1) educating State’s citizens and (2) training state’s lawyers
    * Only 27% MI residents at Law School and only 6% make up MI bar
  * Creates dependencies, entitlement attitude, and stamps a badge of inferiority
  * Constitution forbids affirmative action in the University admissions process
  * EPC renders the color of one’s skin constitutionally irrelevant to Law School’s mission – calls majority’s belief in Law School interest an “aesthetic”
    * Racial classifications offend the Constitution; presumptively unconstitutional regardless of the motives that are behind it
    * Doesn’t think that the doctrine is “smoking out” anything
* Dissent (Rehnquist) - Majority gives too much deference to the University; not enough independent scrutiny
  * The connection between the ends and the means must be precise
* Dissent (Kennedy) - Majority deforms strict scrutiny test to the point where it cannot be said to be applying it
* Notes - Focus is on extrinsic social goods like professionalism, citizenship or leadership
  * Mismatch stigmatizes minorities and reinforces stereotypes/inferiority
  * Thomas seems to be making a moral equivalence argument: race-based AA vs. Jim Crow
  * EPC might mean (1) desire to harm unacceptable and (2) public benefits > social costs
    * This can’t be right because it does not align with the smoking out rationale
    * Harmful to those disadvantaged on account of their race, but also harmful in keeping race alive since puts off day of colorblind world -> balancing act

### *Fisher v. UT-Austin* (2013)

* Facts: New admissions plan adopted by UT system after student body was becoming less diverse. 10% program, where top 10% at any public high school in state would gain automatic admission, was aimed at increasing acceptance and enrollment of racial minorities in light of being barred from using race as an explicit consideration in admissions. 75% of UT class was made up by 10% enrollees, while other 25% were admitted on the basis of a calculated "admissions score" based on test scores and personal achievements. 5th Circuit held this program satisfied standard in *Grutter* and permissibly used race as factor in admissions
* Rule: **University must prove, without deference, that there were no other means to achieve diversity and that the means selected were thus narrowly tailored to that goal**
* Holding: In 7-1 decision, Court reverses 5th Circuit decision
  * Narrow tailoring requires that the reviewing court verify that it is necessary to use race to achieve benefits of diversity. This includes careful judicial inquiry into whether university could achieve the goal without using racial classifications
    * While doesn't require it exhaust every conceivable alternative, strict scrutiny requires court to examine with care and not merely deference to a university's good faith consideration of alternatives (Kennedy, who is writing for the majority, raised this same argument two decades prior in *Grutter*)

## Based Discrimination

* Gender based classifications get intermediate scrutiny
  * Hs roots in *Reed* which struck law down ostensibly under rational basis
  * *Craig v. Boren* canonizes intermediate scrutiny
* Not clear that Ginsburg’s “exceedingly persuasive justification” in VMI is not even higher than intermediate scrutiny

### *Bradwell v. Illinois* (1871)

* Facts: Woman in state of IL is denied license to practice law because of state law which prohibits women from doing so. She argues that she is a citizen of the United States and, having previously been a citizen of Vermont, is entitled to the same rights in IL as she was in the latter state.
* Holding: Upheld law prohibiting women from being licensed to practice law
  * Court rejects argument that practicing law is a privilege of citizenship that is protected by the PIC of 14A. Right to practice law is not one of the rights which a state is forbidden to abridge. If it was a right at all, it would belong to the citizenship of the state and thus is not protected by the Federal government
  * In concurrence pinion, Justice Bradley opined the state was justified in excluding women from the practice of law, stating that the: “Paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble...offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the creator. The rules of civil society must be adapted in the general constitutional of things and cannot be based on exceptional cases...it is within the province of the legislature to ordain which...callings shall be filled and discharged by men”
    * This is institutionalize chauvinism

### *Craig v. Boren* (1976)

* Facts: Oklahoma passes law allowing women to buy low alcohol beer (3.2%) at age 18, but banning men from buying such beer until age 21. Vendor brings claim challenging ths constitutionality of the law and has standing independently (constricts potential consumers). Other P has since turned 21 as thus is would lack standing for mootness. However, vendor still may rely on equal protection challenge challenge to constitutionality because he can assert rights of third parties whom would be adversely affected if his claim was dismissed ofr lack of standing (i.e. those whom he would indirectly violate rights of by refusing to sell to if the law is upheld)
* Question: Is the difference between sexes with respect to purchase of 3.2% beer sufficient to warrant differential in age drawn by the state statute?
* Rule: **To withstand constitutional challenge, classifications of gender must serve important government objectives and be substantially related to those objectives**
* Holding:
  * *Reed* and cases after it make clear that administrative ease is not a sufficiently important objective to withstand challenge (this was under rational basis test). This provides underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other more germane bases of classification
  * Traffic safety is a legitimate government interest (gets further than *Reed*)
  * Gender discrimination not substantially related to that objective - "unduly tenuous fit"; offers weak answer to equal protection question
    * While disparity in drunk driving stats is statistically non-trivial (2 percentage point difference), it hardly can form basis for gender line classification  device
    * Prior cases have rejected use of sex-based classifications where empirical relationships were stronger than in the instant case
    * Also ignores the fact that such low alcohol content is thought to be nonintoxicating, which makes
* Dissent (Rhenquist)
  * The majority is wrong to apply any more stringent scrutiny than rational basis for gender classifications. State legislatures are entitled to great deference in their judgments
* Reed v. Reed (1971) - Partial basis for the ruling in *Craig v. Boren*
  * Law giving preference to two competing applications for administration of estate to males over females is an unconstitutional gender classification. First time court had invalidated a gender classification
    * Applied ration basis test - gender irrelevant factor

### United States v. Virginia

* Facts: VMI was all-male public institution focused on instilling physical and mental discipline in cadets; had adversarial teaching method with little privacy, required physical rigor, and induced mental stress. VWIL set up as women’s alternative with focus on cooperative learning and reinforcement of self-esteem; lower standards to get into institution, less prestigious, smaller endowment. Challenge to exclusion of women brought on equal protection grounds
* Issue: Does exclusion of women from educational opportunities provided exclusively by VMI deny equal protection of laws under 14A?
* Rules:
  * **Intermediate scrutiny - must serve some important governmental interest and means are substantially related to its achievement**
  * **State seeking to defend gender-based government discrimination must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for the action, one that does not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women**
  * **Justification must be genuine, not hypothetical or post-hoc**
* Holding:
  * Ginsburg, writing for the majority, applied intermediate scrutiny (with some bite)
    * However, precedent clear it does not fall under strict scrutiny. Inherent physical differences are recognized, though as cause for celebration and not for denigration or imposition of artificial constraints
    * Classifications may not be used to perpetuate legal, social, and economic inferiority
  * Justification must be exceedingly persuasive; burden is demanding and rests entirely on the state - here they are not
    * Virginia argues that there are benefits of single-sex education and admitting Women to VMI would require large changes and would lose some of that benefit
    * Court says that Virginia has not shown that enhancing educational opportunities by excluding women is the actual purpose. Must be actual purpose, not rationalization of actions that is grounded in other reasons
    * Historical record shows this has always been deliberate. No persuasive evidence that purpose offered by the state is the actual one
    * Aspects of VMI's program (physical training, adversative approach, absence of privacy) would require some accommodations, but no disputing that it **could** be used to educate women
    * State controlling the gates to opportunity may not exclude qualified individuals based on fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of men/women. **Although most women would not chose VMI method, you can't constitutionally deny those women who have the will and capacity the opportunity VMI uniquely affords**
  * Establishment of VWIL was insufficient to remedy exclusion. Fact still remained that women were still denied opportunities available only to men
    * Proper remedy for unconstitutional exclusion aims to eliminate past discriminatory effects and bar like discrimination in the future. Here, the discriminatory effects and exclusionary policy are left intact
    * VMIL offers unequal tangible and intangible facilities. Also lacks the prestige and large alumni base as VMI in addition to rigorous military training approach to education. Withholding these benefits cannot be justified on the basis of inherent differences between the genders (i.e. based on "the way women are")
    * Thus, State has **failed to provide comparable single-gender women's institution**
* Concurrence (Rehnquist)
  * No exceedingly persuasive justification needed, just need to satisfy intermediate scrutiny
  * Only look at actions after Hogan which put VMI on notice about gender classifications to infer purpose for maintaining exclusionary policy
  * However, if benefits from diversity of education opportunity were the actual purpose, it would still be problematic because the interest appears to be those benefits insofar as the relate to men
  * Substantially comparable schools may be okay, as it isn't the fact that Women are excluded isn't what violates equal protection. VWIL is clearly inferior here and maintaining all-male institution without providing comparable all-female one is what violates it

## Classifications Based on Sexual Orientation

* Legal Standard
  * Rational basis – rationally related to a legitimate government interest [no SCOTUS ruling yet, though]
* History
  * Long history of discrimination against gays, lesbians and bisexuals
  * Discriminatory laws usually reflect prejudice and stereotypes rather than actual differences
  * Sexual orientation is immutable
* Animus
  * We think that animus is different from discriminatory purpose
  * Refers to ill-will, lack of adequate regard, malice, spite, disrespect
    * Law adopted due to poor attitudes
  * Discriminatory purpose – a mediate purpose that is not an ultimate purpose
  * Something could be motivated by animus even if there is no discriminatory purpose
  * There might be an interest even if someone isn’t moved by it (i.e. – no desire to read, yet learning to read is good for you), while with animus we think that it must motivate the action

### *Romer v. Evans* (1996)

* Background: CO Amendment to repeal all state and local laws prohibiting discrimination against gays and preventing future laws that provide protection to this class
* Holding: Unconstitutional because it fails rational basis review (animus is an issue)
  * Denies a single-named group protect of the laws without legitimate purpose
    * "Homosexuals are put in a solitary class with respect to transactions and relations in both private and the governmental sphere. The amendment withdraws from them, but no others, specific legal protection from injuries caused by discrimination"
  * Animosity towards gays and lesbians seems to be the only purpose - bears no rational relation to any legitimate state purpose
    * Animus against gays and lesbians, even when presented as a purported "moral" basis for a law, is not sufficient to meet rational basis test

## Congressional Enforcement

* It is clear that §5 of the 14th Amendment cannot be used to regulate private activity. However, what is the scope of Congress's enforcement power under 14A5? Two primary positions on this question
  1. Nationalist perspective - Can use 14A5 to independently interpret constitution and expand the scope of rights (see *Katzenbach*)
  1. Federalist perspective - 14A5 cannot create new rights or expand the scope of rights; it can only act to prevent or remedy violations of rights and such laws must be narrowly tailored (*Boerne*)
     * Arguments for: Has virtue of protecting judiciary as authoritative expositor of the constitution. Is also consistent with more restrictive view of federalism that had defined recent decisions in other key areas
     * Arguments against: Denies Congress power to expand scope of rights. Constitution has long been regarded as the "floor" or the minimum liberties possessed by all - that government is invited to expand is an idea consistent with 9A as well

### Enforcement Powers

* **Simple** – Congress not prohibiting any conduct beyond what judiciary would hold unconstitutional [11A abrogation]
  * **Penalizing** – provide for penalties for constitutional violations
  * **Procedural** – Congress creates procedures for adjudicating violations
* **Complex** – Congress does prohibit some conduct that judiciary would not itself determine is unconstitutional
  * **Prophylactic** – Congress creates a broad statutory prohibition encompassing a narrower constitutional prohibition to minimize false negatives in adjudication. Constitutionality is often difficult to prove or judicially determine (evidentiary problems) even when the actual purpose is unconstitutional. Expanding prohibition beyond that which is judicially ascertainable allows Congress to catch those under-the-radar instances
    * *South Carolina v. Katzenbach* (1966) – Upholds 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibiting writing tests in states with history of discrimination even though Court said need proof of discriminatory purpose
  * **Remedial** – Congress prohibits/mandates some conduct as a means to remedy what the Court has determined to be a constitutional violation
    * **Curative** – Eliminate or reduce current harms that are consequence of past constitutional violations
      * Constitutional violation and past discrimination; prohibits some law otherwise constitutional
    * **Preservative** (Representation reinforcing) – Eliminate present constitutional violations by better enabling victims to help themselves
      * Prevent other unconstitutional violations
  * **Substantive** – Congress prohibits conduct even though Court has determined that the conduct is not unconstitutional
    * **Interpretive** – Congress concludes judiciary has misinterpreted a relevant constitutional provision
    * **Applicatory** – Congress applies judge-made doctrine to find a constitutional violation (e.g. *Morgan*, suggesting Congress might have found NY law was adopted for an ethnically discriminatory purpose)
      * **Fact-finding** – Congress concludes some conduct violates Constitution after finding brute fact (e.g. record shows State's purpose clearly discriminatory)
      * **Evaluative** – Congress concludes some conduct violations constitution in making an evaluative judgment (i.e. whether the interest is “compelling” )

### *Katzenbach v. Morgan* (1966)

* Facts: Voting Rights Act says no person completing 6th grade in Puerto Rico can be denied right to vote due to failing English literacy requirement. Prohibits enforcement of an NY election law requiring ability to read and write to vote. Passed in response to court upholding constitutionality of a English literacy test in order to be eligible to vote, which posed difficulties for those not speaking english as their primary language
* Issue: Question is not whether determine whether NY literacy requirement itself violated EPC, but whether Congress had power under 14A5 to prohibit NY law as an enforcement of the EPC
* Holding: Court upholds this provision as a **proper exercise of powers granted under 14A5**
* Majority Reasoning
  * Issue implicit in this case was whether Congress was limited to remedying what the Court had previously found to be unconstitutional discrimination or if it could independently interpret the Constitution
    * Court ultimately **speaks broadly of Congress's powers under 14A5 and expressly rejected argument that legislative powers were confined to the insignificant goal of abrogating state laws that the judiciary was prepared to declare unconstitutional**)
      * Court says that interpretation of 14A5 requiring judicial determination that state law precluded by Congress violated the constitution (14A1) would depreciate Congressional resourcefulness and responsibility for implementing 14A
      * Broad powers in 14A5 similar to those expressed in N&P clause - **must be regarded as enactment to enforce EPC, must be plainly adapted to that end, and must be consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution**. All of these are met
  * Two reasons to support its conclusion
    * Congress could have concluded that granting Puerto Ricans the right to vote would empower them and help them to eliminate discrimination against them. In essence, this was a remedy for discrimination against them (Remedial - Preventative)
    * Could conclude the literacy test denied equal protection, even though earlier Court decisions held that this was not the case (Prophylactic)
  * NY responds with its own 5A argument, asserting this discriminates against U.S. citizens born and educated outside of U.S. territory
    * Court rejects this. Not excluding from the franchise, but simply further extending it. Can't strike down the law because it could have gone further than it did (tolerance for tolerance for underinclusiveness "reform may take one step at a time")
  * In a footnote, Brennan says that §5 does not grant Congress power to exercise discretion in the other direction and enact statues to dilute equal protection and due process decisions of the court
* Dissent (Harlan)
  * Concerned about ability of Congress to negate constitutional rights
  * Congress does not have power to limit effect of judicial opinions of what is or is not constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause
  * Congress may take remedial measures to redress and prevent wrongs

### *City of Boerne v. Flores* (1997)

* Facts: Permit to expand church that is in historic district was denied by city in Texas; Archbishop sues under RFRA. RFRA enforcing Free Exercise Clause which is incorporated against states by 14A. RFRA requires compelling interest for laws substantially burdening religious exercise and it be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest. Passed in response to (and against) *Smith*, a SCOTUS decision that narrowly interpreted Free Exercise Clause and held that it could not be used to challenge neutral laws of general applicability (neutral insofar as it lacks motivation to interfere with religion and applies to everyone equally)
* Rule: **Congress, under 14A5, may not create new rights or expanding the scope of rights; it may only pass laws that prevent or remedy violations of rights recognized by the Court and must be narrowly tailored - "proportionate" and "congruent" - to the constitutional violation**
* Holding: RFRA was held to be unconstitutional exercise of Congressional power under 14A5
* Majority Reasoning (Kennedy)
  * Congress' power under 14A5 only extends to enforcing the provisions of the amendment. It does not have the power to determine what violates a constitutional violation, else it would not be "enforcing" in any meaningful sense. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing it
  * Quoting *Marbury*, restated the importance of the Judiciary as the authoritative interpreter of the constitution
    * > If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be 'superior paramount law unchangeable by ordinary means.' It would be 'on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and like other acts, ... alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it'
  * Congress given great deference to determine line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and those that make substantive changes to the governing law. Must be congruence and proportionality to between the injury prevented/remedied and means adopted to that end
  * RFRA’s restrictions are too broad; not proportional and congruent
    * Reach and scope extend to any level of government, at any time, whenever an individual feels a law has placed a substantial burden on his free exercise of religion. Legislative record also contained little evidence of consitutional violations
    * The RFRA **prohibits too much that would not violate the constitution and thus exceeded scope of 14A5 powers**
* Dissent, O’Connor
  * Smith was wrongly decided and should be overruled
  * Agrees with the majority about the power of Congress under 14A §5
* Notes
  * Complex enforcement
    * Prophylactic because RFRA broader than limited cases with anti-religious purpose alone that are unconstitutional under *Smith*
    * Permissible to use complex prophylactic, but must satisfy proportionality and congruence test. It failed to in *Boerne*
  * Substantive interpretative because Congress effectively implies *Smith* was wrong and *Sherbert* was right
    * Court says **substantive interpretive is not permissible**

### *Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents* (2000)

* Facts: ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age (40+) with an exception for bona fide occupational qualifications reasonably needed for normal operation of particular business. Any person aggrieved by violation of the act has private right of action, including violations by the States. FSU faculty and librarians sue state for not allocating funds for market adjustment of salaries, which has a disparate impact on base pay for older employees. District court dismissed suit on the basis of 11th amendment immunity. CoA affirmed, holding that ADEA does not validly abrogate the States' 11A immunity
* Issues: Does ADEA contain clear statement of Congress' intent to abrogate 11A immunity, and if so, was ADEA a proper exercise of constitutional authority under §5?
* Holding: ADEA clearly expressed intent to abrogate, but exceeded Congress' authority under 14A5
  * Majority reasoning:
    * Long been established that can't abrogate through exercise of Art. I power (e.g. commerce clause). However, 14A5 does grant Congress the authority to abrogate State sovereign immunity - this is a necessary limitation of 11A in light of the enforcement provision of 14A
    * **Applying congruence and proportionality test, ADEA is not appropriate legislation** under 14A5
      * Substantive requirements imposed on state and local governments were disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional conduct targeted by the act. Also, lack of widespread evidence of constitutional violations by States
      * Only rational basis review for age discrimination because no historical basis and not discrete and insular minority. Age is also often a legitimate criteria for employers
        * Judged against backdrop of EPC jurisprudence, ADEA is **so out of proportion to supposed preventative object that it can't be understood as responsive to unconstitutional behavior**. No reason for Congress to believe such broad prophylactic legislation was necessary in this field

* Facts: ADA prevents discrimination against disabled; must make reasonable accommodations. P diagnosed with breast cancer and had to take substantial leave from job at public university in order to seek treatment; she was told that she would have to give up her Director position and take a job paying much less. She brought suit under the ADA
* Holding: State governments may not be sued for violating Title I of the ADA - Congress lacked authority to abrogate State 11A immunity under 14A5
* Majority Reasoning (Rhenquist):
  * ADA is a substantial expansion of rights compared to the Constitution. He explained that under EPC analysis, discrimination based on disability only need meet a rational basis test, being rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. The ADA prohibits much more tl1an would fail a rational basis test, and its requirement for reasonable accommodation of disabilities is significantly greater than the Constitution requires
    * Legislative record also showed a lack of a pattern of irrational state discrimination
    * Thus, failed to satisfy the "proportionate and congruent" test
* Dissent (Bryer):
  * Plenty of evidence in the record (over 300 examples) to show unconstitutional behavior - Court's failure to find this sufficient may rest on its decision to hold Congress to a strict judicially create evidentiary standard
  * Give great deference to Congress to determine is rationally related to interests
  * Discrimination resting solely upon negative attitudes/fears/irrational prejudice violates the 14th Amendment (Cleburne)
  * There is a disconnect between doctrinal standard (rational basis) and the constitutional precept
    * What rational basis requires is not what the EPC requires. It is a judicial doctrine which often underenforces
    * Using constitutional precept instead of judicial doctrine, then the law looks much more congruent and proportional
    * Precept = there should be no purposeless discrimination against the disabled
