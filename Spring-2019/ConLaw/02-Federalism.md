# Federalism

## In General

* The central question of federalism is: what is the scope of federal (i.e. Congressional) power in relation to the states?
  * States have police powers, which are ability to adopt any law not prohibited by Constitution
  * Federal government only has enumerated powers, which means ability to only make laws via express powers
  * Dual federalism: federal and state governments are separate sovereigns, each having separate zones of authority

### *McCulloch v. Maryland*

* Background
  * Specific issue giving rise to the case is whether state (MD) could impose tax on Bank of the United States
  * Two main questions
    1. Does Congress have authority to create bank in the first place?
    1. Is a state tax on the bank constitutional?
* Holdings:
  * **If the end is legitimate and within the scope of the Constitution, then all means appropriate and plainly adapted to that end are constitutional if not prohibited**, thus congress has authority to create bank
    * Means must be “consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution”
  * People of single state cannot confer sovereignty extending over people of all states, thus unconstitutional for state to collect tax on national bank that would be imposed on individuals without representation in that state
* Significance of *McCulloch*
  * Finds power to do something that isn’t even in the Constitution
    * Sets the stage for expansive national government powers, especially post-New Deal
  * Method by which Marshall got to the conclusion in first holding is unique
    * *Marbury* uses express language and points directly at Constitution [restrictive]
    * *McCulloch* adds on to what it says in Constitution [expansive]
* Key discussion points
  * Rejection of notion of compact federalism
    * Compact federalism views states as supreme and retaining ultimate sovereignty, as they are the ones that ratified constitution in the first place and delegated powers to federal government. Under this view, federal power must be exercised in subordination to the states.
    * Marshall rejects this idea, holding that the people, not states, were the ones that ratified the constitution and are thus sovereign. Ratification by the states was an instrument of the people's will and thus affirmance can't be negated by state governments.
    * Marshall's view has controlled throughout history and was most recently reaffirmed in *Term Limits*
  * Scope of congressional powers
    * Just because bank creation powers are not specifically enumerated in the constitution, this is not dispositive. It would be unreasonable for constitution to list ever conceivable power
    * Marshall, in famous quote, reminds us that it is a "constitution we are expounding", meaning it is a document intended to endure and thus adapt. If powers limited to those enumerated, unlikely the constitution would have survived, at least without constantly being amended
    * Ultimate conclusion is that congress may chose any means not prohibited by the constitution to carry out its lawful authority, thus congress can create a bank as means of carrying out its other powers
    * Keep in mind, court adopts this expansive view BEFORE discussing the N&P clause
  * Necessary and proper clause
    * IF end is legitimate and in the scope of constitution; AND means are appropriate, adapted to that end, and does not violate the letter or spirit of then constitution; THEN the means is constitutional
    * Marshall opinion rejects narrow definition of necessary as essential or indispensable for achieving a goal. Instead, necessary is interpreted a useful or desireable. Need for endurance and adaptation at the heart of this definition
    * Fact that N&P clause located in §8, which expands congresses power, is evidence. The power is not unlimited, however. Court must declare unlawful those means that violate constitution or enacted under the pretext of executing lawful powers in order to achieve otherwise impermissible ends
  * Ability of states to impede exercise of federal power
    * Power to tax includes power to destroy or render useless, thus allowing MD to tax bank would greatly impede operation of lawful federal power
    * Court notes that state tax on federal bank is effectively tax on other states. Since residents of those states have no representation in MD, the tax is illegitimate
    * Based on principle that it is unfair to allow states to regulate those who have no representation in that state, which also likely serves as a basis of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce

### *Term Limits v. Thornton*

* General Overview
  * Arkansas state amendment which would add additional qualifications to membership of the House that would prohibit an incumbent who has served two terms from appearing on the ballot
  * Two issues
    1. Does Constitution forbid States from altering qualifications specifically enumerated in the Constitution?
    1. Does fact that it is formulated as a ballot access measure as opposed to an outright disqualification matter?
* Significance of the decision
  * Is evidence of two relevant phenomena that have defined and shaped constitutional law since our nation's conception
    1. Differences in views on federalism
    1. Differences in constitutional interpretations
  * Majority and dissent reference the same constitutional language and cases, yet diverge in their conclusions
    * This could be the result of differences in constitutional interpretation or related to the substantive values (and balance thereof) on each side of the federalism issue
* Stevens' Majority Opinion
  * Preclusion Argument (Divestment of Power)
    * Text and structure of Constitution, historical practice, and democratic principles show Qualifications Clause intended to preclude states from any power to add/amend qualifications fixed in the Constitution
  * Framers’ intent shows desire for fixed and exclusive qualifications divesting states of power to add other qualifications (Extension of 1st main proposition from *Powell* and preclusion argument)
    * Court reaffirms proposition from *Powell* that qualifications in constitutions are fixed insofar as they can't be altered by congress, though this doesn't directly address the issue of whether the states can do so
      * Historical evidence - No addition of a property ownership qualification, which was discussed
    * Uniformity in considerations of qualifications desired, which would be undermined by a patchwork of state qualifications (those elected whom would exclusively represent the interest of the state)
    * Elected officials owe their allegiance to the people rather than their respective States/constituencies
    * No discussion at all about states being able to add qualifications (silence)
  * Democratic principles also compel a fixed set of qualifications \[2nd main proposition in *Powell* and preclusion argument\]
    * Opportunity to elected office must be open to all, subject to age and residency needs
    * Term limits restrict ability of voters to vote for whom they wish
    * People should be able to choose representatives, not the States \[egalitarian value\]
  * 10th Amendment Argument
    * Argument Premises
      1. States only have those powers that 10th Amendment grants/recognizes
      1. 10th Amendment only reserves powers that preexisted the constitution
      1. State lacked power to add congressional term limits before constitution because congress didn't exist
    * Conclusion: States lack power to add term limits (i.e. add to the Qualifications Clause)
* Kennedy Concurrence
  * State does not serve as intermediary between people and federal government. The relationship between people and federal government is a direct one
  * Maintaining this unique, “national” character of the federal government is necessary for maintaining the political identity of United States citizens as members of one nation, in addition to members of individual states
* Thomas Dissent
  * Default rules
    * If not specifically enumerated in the constitution, not within federal powers
    * All unenumerated powers reserved to the states
  * Agrees with outcome of *Powell*, but rejects majority reasoning, as *Powell* was merely the result of congress lacking a power (i.e. adding qualifications) due to the default rules espoused in the dissents view. Thus, *Powell* is consistent with idea that where constitution does not speak on power either expressly or by necessary implication, the government lacks that power and states enjoy it
    * However, necessary implication language seems to conflict with the reasoning of the court in *McCulloch*
  * Constitution does not recognize undifferentiated people of Nation; splits into states made up of people that comprise the nation.
  * Doesn’t make sense to reserve only powers previously controlled; there would be no powers to reserve in that case

## Commerce Clause

* Most important of the 18 clauses in the constitution addressing specific congressional powers is Article I §8
  * > The Congress hall have the power...to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes...
* Throughout the eras, court has essentially been considering three questions related to commerce clause and its scope
  1. What is commerce?
  1. What does among the several states mean?
  1. Does 10th amendment limit the scope of congress' commerce powers?

### Gibbons v. Ogden (SCOTUS 1824) - Seminal Commerce Clause Case
  
* Background
  * Fulton and Livingston given monopoly to operate steamboats in NY waters, who license Ogden to operate ferry boat between NYC and NJ
  * Gibbons maintains he has right to operate his ferry b/c he had a federal license under federal law ("vessels in the coasting trade")
* Outcome
  1. Federal law preempts state law
  1. NY monopoly unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce
* Rule
  * Power to regulate is to proscribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed, and this power is complete in itself; limited to specified objects and plenary as to those objects.
* Key Discussion Points
  * Commerce is more than buying and selling; it is intercourse. Regulates commercial intercourse between nations, parts of nations, and in all its branches, by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse
  * Commerce is not just traffic, but all phases of business including transportation.
  * Three Possible Meanings of “Among the States”
    1. Limit Congress to regulated interstate activities; no intrastate commerce regulation
    1. Concerning more than one state – regulate intrastate commerce if affects other states
    1. Define as in the midst of – regulate all commerce, even in an individual state
  * *Gibbons* court settles on the middle definition, which would require case-by-case inquiries as to whether a particular commercial activity has interstate effects
  * Court asserts there are no 10th Amendment restraints where object of regulation falls within commerce. Courts have zig-zagged on this view over periods since *Gibbons*

### From the Gilded Age to New Deal

* Period from 1887 to 1937 characterized by concept of dual federalism, which was embodied in 3 different doctrines:
  1. Narrow definition of commerce so as to leave a zone of power to the states. Commerce was viewed as a stage of business distinct from resource extraction, production, etc. These were left to state regulation
  1. Restrictive definition of "among the states", allowing congress to regulate only when there was a **substantial effect** on interstate commerce
  1. 10th Amendment interpreted as reserving zone of activities to the states so that even federal laws consistent with commerce clause were unconstitutional by invading that zone
* Narrow Definition of Commerce
  * *U.S. v. E.C. Knight* (1895): commerce does not include manufacturing; effect of manufacturing monopoly on interstate commerce is indirect
    * Application of Sherman Antitrust Act preventing 98% market share via acquisition unconstitutional
    * Direct/indirect distinction - it would be too far reaching to allow Congress to act wherever commerce may be affected
    * Manufacturing is not commerce ("commerce succeeds manufacturing and is not part of it")
  * *Carter v. Carter Coal* (1936): Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 regulating wages and hours unconstitutional
    * Act regulates production rather than trade; can’t set up coal boards to set min. wages and hours
    * Mining is not commerce (consistent with *EC Knight*)
    * Outside stream of commerce and indirect effect on interstate commerce (consistent with *Schecter Poultry*)
    * Dissent
      * Cardozo says should focus on substantiality rather than directness; need to draw lines
* Restrictive Definition of “Among the States”
  * *Swift v. U.S.* (1905): Congress may regulate meat packing under Sherman Act because it is “within the stream of interstate commerce"
  * *Shreveport Rate Case* (1914): Can regulate intrastate railroad because of direct impact on interstate railroad activity, even if intrastate transaction of interstate carriers are also affected
    * Regulation of intrastate commerce is permissible if “close and substantial” relationship to interstate commerce
    * Need to prevent price discrimination against Louisiana railroad activity into the state
  * *Schecter Poultry Corp. v. U.S.* (1935): regulation of chicken sales and work conditions in NYC unconstitutional because it affects intrastate business operations more than interstate transactions
    * NIRA wage and hour regulations applied to wholesale chicken industry
    * Stream of commerce concept has come to an end w/ this case; indirect effect not close and substantial
    * Congress only has authority to regulate where there are direct affects on interstate transactions
* 10th Amendment Limitations
  * *Champion v. Ames* (1903): federal law prohibiting interstate shipment of lottery tickets constitutional because it limits what may be sold in interstate commerce
    * Motivated to protect public morals, not to protect commerce; harm has yet to come at time of regulation
    * Power to regulate interstate commerce is complete in itself (cf. *Gibbons*)
    * Dissent = Fuller quotes pretext passage in *McCulloch*; concerned w/ motivations behind this federal law
      * Has been reluctance by courts to consider motive as long as activity falls within definition of commerce (i.e. moral end instead of economic end), though this appears to conflict with *McCulloch*
      * When contrasted with *Hammer*, it becomes clear that there is an arbitrariness in how the court applied this doctrine
  * *Hoke v. U.S.* (1913): upholds Mann Act prohibiting interstate transportation of women for immoral purposes
  * *Hammer v. Dagenhart* (1918): Act banning interstate shipment of goods produced by child labor is unconstitutional b/c controls production rather than commerce
    * Necessary effect of ban is to regulate hours of child labor in manufacturing and mining occurring intrastate
    * Court concludes that 10th Amendment reserves control of activities such as mining and manufacturing, so federal laws regulating interstate commerce were unconstitutional if they sought to control mining
    * Court argue that if upheld, there would be far reaching effects of allowing to control matters reserved for local authorities simply by prohibiting the movement of commodities out of state would effectively end state control over the matters
    * Court claims it is not inquiring into congressional purpose or motive
    * Champion and Hoke, harm was yet to come; here harm complete prior to start of interstate comm.
* At end of this period, there was significant pressure for a change in doctrine, as the court's interpretation limited congressional commerce power, overturning important pieces of new deal legislation. The doctrines were also intellectually vulnerable because the decisions appeared to have rested on arbitrary distinctions and reasoning
