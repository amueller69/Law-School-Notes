# Federalism

## In General

* The central question of federalism is: what is the scope of federal (i.e. Congressional) power in relation to the states?
  * States have police powers, which are ability to adopt any law not prohibited by Constitution
  * Federal government only has enumerated powers, which means ability to only make laws via express powers
  * Dual federalism: federal and state governments are separate sovereigns, each having separate zones of authority

### *McCulloch v. Maryland*

* Background
  * Specific issue giving rise to the case is whether state (MD) could impose tax on Bank of the United States
  * Two main questions
    1. Does Congress have authority to create bank in the first place?
    1. Is a state tax on the bank constitutional?
* Holdings:
  * **If the end is legitimate and within the scope of the Constitution, then all means appropriate and plainly adapted to that end are constitutional if not prohibited**, thus congress has authority to create bank
    * Means must be “consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution”
  * People of single state cannot confer sovereignty extending over people of all states, thus unconstitutional for state to collect tax on national bank that would be imposed on individuals without representation in that state
* Significance of *McCulloch*
  * Finds power to do something that isn’t even in the Constitution
    * Sets the stage for expansive national government powers, especially post-New Deal
  * Method by which Marshall got to the conclusion in first holding is unique
    * *Marbury* uses express language and points directly at Constitution [restrictive]
    * *McCulloch* adds on to what it says in Constitution [expansive]
  
* Key discussion points
  * Rejection of notion of compact federalism
    * Compact federalism views states as supreme and retaining ultimate sovereignty, as they are the ones that ratified constitution in the first place and delegated powers to federal government. Under this view, federal power must be exercised in subordination to the states.
    * Marshall rejects this idea, holding that the people, not states, were the ones that ratified the constitution and are thus sovereign. Ratification by the states was an instrument of the people's will and thus affirmance can't be negated by state governments.
    * Marshall's view has controlled throughout history and was most recently reaffirmed in *Term Limits*
  * Scope of congressional powers
    * Just because bank creation powers are not specifically enumerated in the constitution, this is not dispositive. It would be unreasonable for constitution to list ever conceivable power
    * Marshall, in famous quote, reminds us that it is a "constitution we are expounding", meaning it is a document intended to endure and thus adapt. If powers limited to those enumerated, unlikely the constitution would have survived, at least without constantly being amended
    * Ultimate conclusion is that congress may chose any means not prohibited by the constitution to carry out its lawful authority, thus congress can create a bank as means of carrying out its other powers
    * Keep in mind, court adopts this expansive view BEFORE discussing the N&P clause
  * Necessary and proper clause
    * IF end is legitimate and in the scope of constitution; AND means are appropriate, adapted to that end, and does not violate the letter or spirit of then constitution; THEN the means is constitutional
    * Marshall opinion rejects narrow definition of necessary as essential or indispensable for achieving a goal. Instead, necessary is interpreted a useful or desireable. Need for endurance and adaptation at the heart of this definition
    * Fact that N&P clause located in §8, which expands congresses power, is evidence. The power is not unlimited, however. Court must declare unlawful those means that violate constitution or enacted under the pretext of executing lawful powers in order to achieve otherwise impermissible ends
  * Ability of states to impede exercise of federal power
    * Power to tax includes power to destroy or render useless, thus allowing MD to tax bank would greatly impede operation of lawful federal power
    * Court notes that state tax on federal bank is effectively tax on other states. Since residents of those states have no representation in MD, the tax is illegitimate
    * Based on principle that it is unfair to allow states to regulate those who have no representation in that state, which also likely serves as a basis of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce

### *Term Limits v. Thornton*

* General Overview
  * Arkansas state amendment which would add additional qualifications to membership of the House that would prohibit an incumbent who has served two terms from appearing on the ballot
  * Two issues
    1. Does Constitution forbid States from altering qualifications specifically enumerated in the Constitution?
    1. Does fact that it is formulated as a ballot access measure as opposed to an outright disqualification matter?
* Significance of the decision
  * Is evidence of two relevant phenomena that have defined and shaped constitutional law since our nation's conception
    1. Differences in views on federalism
    1. Differences in constitutional interpretations
  * Majority and dissent reference the same constitutional language and cases, yet diverge in their conclusions
    * This could be the result of differences in constitutional interpretation or related to the substantive values (and balance thereof) on each side of the federalism issue
* Stevens' Majority Opinion
  * Preclusion Argument (Divestment of Power)
    * Text and structure of Constitution, historical practice, and democratic principles show Qualifications Clause intended to preclude states from any power to add/amend qualifications fixed in the Constitution
  * Framers’ intent shows desire for fixed and exclusive qualifications divesting states of power to add other qualifications (Extension of 1st main proposition from *Powell* and preclusion argument)
    * Court reaffirms proposition from *Powell* that qualifications in constitutions are fixed insofar as they can't be altered by congress, though this doesn't directly address the issue of whether the states can do so
      * Historical evidence - No addition of a property ownership qualification, which was discussed
    * Uniformity in considerations of qualifications desired, which would be undermined by a patchwork of state qualifications (those elected whom would exclusively represent the interest of the state)
    * Elected officials owe their allegiance to the people rather than their respective States/constituencies
    * No discussion at all about states being able to add qualifications (silence)
  * Democratic principles also compel a fixed set of qualifications \[2nd main proposition in *Powell* and preclusion argument\]
    * Opportunity to elected office must be open to all, subject to age and residency needs
    * Term limits restrict ability of voters to vote for whom they wish
    * People should be able to choose representatives, not the States \[egalitarian value\]
  * 10th Amendment Argument
    * Argument Premises
      1. States only have those powers that 10th Amendment grants/recognizes
      1. 10th Amendment only reserves powers that preexisted the constitution
      1. State lacked power to add congressional term limits before constitution because congress didn't exist
    * Conclusion: States lack power to add term limits (i.e. add to the Qualifications Clause)
* Kennedy Concurrence
  * State does not serve as intermediary between people and federal government. The relationship between people and federal government is a direct one
  * Maintaining this unique, “national” character of the federal government is necessary for maintaining the political identity of United States citizens as members of one nation, in addition to members of individual states
* Thomas Dissent
  * Default rules
    * If not specifically enumerated in the constitution, not within federal powers
    * All unenumerated powers reserved to the states
  * Agrees with outcome of *Powell*, but rejects majority reasoning, as *Powell* was merely the result of congress lacking a power (i.e. adding qualifications) due to the default rules espoused in the dissents view. Thus, *Powell* is consistent with idea that where constitution does not speak on power either expressly or by necessary implication, the government lacks that power and states enjoy it
    * However, necessary implication language seems to conflict with the reasoning of the court in *McCulloch*
  * Constitution does not recognize undifferentiated people of Nation; splits into states made up of people that comprise the nation.
  * Doesn’t make sense to reserve only powers previously controlled; there would be no powers to reserve in that case

## Commerce Clause

* Most important of the 18 clauses in the constitution addressing specific congressional powers is Article I §8
  * > The Congress hall have the power...to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes...
* Throughout the eras, court has essentially been considering three questions related to commerce clause and its scope
  1. What is commerce?
  1. What does among the several states mean?
  1. Does 10th amendment limit the scope of congress' commerce powers?

### Gibbons v. Ogden (SCOTUS 1824) - The Grandfather of Commerce Clause Cases
  
* Background
  * Fulton and Livingston given monopoly to operate steamboats in NY waters, who license Ogden to operate ferry boat between NYC and NJ
  * Gibbons maintains he has right to operate his ferry because he had a federal license under federal law ("vessels in the coasting trade")
* Outcome
  1. Federal law preempts state law
  1. NY monopoly unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce
* Rule
  * Power to regulate is to proscribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed, and this power is complete in itself; limited to specified objects and plenary as to those objects.
* Key Discussion Points
  * Commerce is more than buying and selling; it is intercourse. Regulates commercial intercourse between nations, parts of nations, and in all its branches, by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse
  * Commerce is not just traffic, but all phases of business including transportation.
  * Three Possible Meanings of “Among the States”
    1. Limit Congress to regulated interstate activities; no intrastate commerce regulation
    1. Concerning more than one state – regulate intrastate commerce if affects other states
    1. Define as in the midst of – regulate all commerce, even in an individual state
  * *Gibbons* court settles on the middle definition, which would require case-by-case inquiries as to whether a particular commercial activity has interstate effects
  * Court asserts there are no 10th Amendment restraints where object of regulation falls within commerce. Courts have zig-zagged on this view over periods since *Gibbons*

### From the Gilded Age to New Deal

* Period from 1887 to 1937 characterized by concept of dual federalism, which was embodied in 3 different doctrines:
  1. Narrow definition of commerce so as to leave a zone of power to the states. Commerce was viewed as a stage of business distinct from resource extraction, production, etc. These were left to state regulation
  1. Restrictive definition of "among the states", allowing congress to regulate only when there was a **substantial effect** on interstate commerce
  1. 10th Amendment interpreted as reserving zone of activities to the states so that even federal laws consistent with commerce clause were unconstitutional by invading that zone
  
* Narrow Definition of Commerce
  * *U.S. v. E.C. Knight* (1895): commerce does not include manufacturing; effect of manufacturing monopoly on interstate commerce is indirect
    * Application of Sherman Antitrust Act preventing 98% market share via acquisition unconstitutional
    * Direct/indirect distinction - it would be too far reaching to allow Congress to act wherever commerce may be affected
    * Manufacturing is not commerce ("commerce succeeds manufacturing and is not part of it")
  
  * *Carter v. Carter Coal* (1936): Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 regulating wages and hours unconstitutional
    * Act regulates production rather than trade; can’t set up coal boards to set min. wages and hours
    * Mining is not commerce (consistent with *EC Knight*)
    * Outside stream of commerce and indirect effect on interstate commerce (consistent with *Schecter Poultry*)
    * Dissent
      * Cardozo says should focus on substantiality rather than directness; need to draw lines
  
* Restrictive Definition of “Among the States”
  * *Swift v. U.S.* (1905): Congress may regulate meat packing under Sherman Act because it is “within the stream of interstate commerce"
  
  * *Shreveport Rate Case* (1914): Can regulate intrastate railroad because of direct impact on interstate railroad activity, even if intrastate transaction of interstate carriers are also affected
    * Regulation of intrastate commerce is permissible if “close and substantial” relationship to interstate commerce
    * Need to prevent price discrimination against Louisiana railroad activity into the state
  
  * *Schecter Poultry Corp. v. U.S.* (1935): regulation of chicken sales and work conditions in NYC unconstitutional because it affects intrastate business operations more than interstate transactions
    * NIRA wage and hour regulations applied to wholesale chicken industry
    * Stream of commerce concept has come to an end w/ this case; indirect effect not close and substantial
    * Congress only has authority to regulate where there are direct affects on interstate transactions
  
* 10th Amendment Limitations
  * *Champion v. Ames* (1903): federal law prohibiting interstate shipment of lottery tickets constitutional because it limits what may be sold in interstate commerce
    * Motivated to protect public morals, not to protect commerce; harm has yet to come at time of regulation
    * Power to regulate interstate commerce is complete in itself (cf. *Gibbons*)
    * Dissent = Fuller quotes pretext passage in *McCulloch*; concerned w/ motivations behind this federal law
      * Has been reluctance by courts to consider motive as long as activity falls within definition of commerce (i.e. moral end instead of economic end), though this appears to conflict with *McCulloch*
      * When contrasted with *Hammer*, it becomes clear that there is an arbitrariness in how the court applied this doctrine
  
  * *Hoke v. U.S.* (1913): upholds Mann Act prohibiting interstate transportation of women for immoral purposes
  
  * *Hammer v. Dagenhart* (1918): Act banning interstate shipment of goods produced by child labor is unconstitutional because controls production rather than commerce
    * Necessary effect of ban is to regulate hours of child labor in manufacturing and mining occurring intrastate
    * Court concludes that 10th Amendment reserves control of activities such as mining and manufacturing, so federal laws regulating interstate commerce were unconstitutional if they sought to control mining
    * Court argue that if upheld, there would be far reaching effects of allowing to control matters reserved for local authorities simply by prohibiting the movement of commodities out of state would effectively end state control over the matters
    * Court claims it is not inquiring into congressional purpose or motive
    * Champion and Hoke, harm was yet to come; here harm complete prior to start of interstate comm.
  
* At end of this period, there was significant pressure for a change in doctrine, as the court's interpretation limited congressional commerce power, overturning important pieces of new deal legislation. The doctrines were also intellectually vulnerable because the decisions appeared to have rested on arbitrary distinctions and reasoning

### Post New Deal Relaxation of Limitations (*Wickard* and *Darby*)

* *NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel* (1937) - NLRA challenged by Steel Industry, Court reverses direction:
  1. Rejects categorical approach to commerce (e.g. *Knight*); steel “production” is no bar: "...that the employees were engaged in production is not prohibitive"
  1. Cardozo is avenged. Directness based approach is rejected. Power under the commerce clause is "necessarily one of degree"
  1. Court speaks broadly about Congress' commerce power: The power to regulate is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no mater what the source of the dangers which threaten it. Not as clear at the time, but signals the major shift captured in *Darby* and *Wickard*
  
* *U.S. v. Darby* (1941) - FLSA prevents good failing to meet labor standard from being shipped or produced for purpose of interstate commerce
  1. Power to regulate w/in the bounds of ICC is plenary, courts will not inquire into motives to determine constitutionality (*Hammer* and seems to conflict with *McCulloch*)
     * Rejects view that activities such as production reserved exclusively to the states
  1. Even purely intrastate activity (production) satisfies among the states because of substantial interstate effects
     * Failing to pay minimum wage in one state would drive down wages in nearby states to compete -> interstate effects
     * Power over interstate commerce extends to intrastate commerce so affecting interstate commerce as to make regulation an appropriate means to a legitimate end
  1. 10A is not an independent external constraint on the commerce power, it merely “states a truism.” We already know that powers not granted to congress are reserved to the states.
  
* *Wickard v. Fillburn* (1942) - Quota on wheat production challenged subsistence farmer
  1. Cannonizes rule that would control until 1995: Regulation constitutional so long as Congress could rationally conclude the activity, in the aggregate, had a substantial effect on interstate commerce
     * Substantial Effects is the first prong, which looks at economic measures in the aggregate. Though P's own homegrown wheat didn't have any direct affect on interstate commerce, this activity collectively has effects on wheat market demand and thus interstate commerce
     * Rational Basis
  1. Rejects the formalistic distinctions from the former era such as commerce vs. production or indirect vs. direct effects. These are irrelevant if the substantial affects, measured in economic terms, support the reach of power

* Other Cases and Developments
  * Elimination of the word substantial in *Hodel*, where court could only invalidate if there is no rational basis that the regulated activity affects interstate commerce. Hard to imagine anything could not be regulated under this broad interpretation of the clause
  * Implications of the trilogy above:
    * Congress can set terms of items shipped interstate; it could virtually regulate anything that could potentially travel over state lines
    * Purely intrastate activities could be regulated so long as there is rational basis for believing there is an interstate effect or that it is necessary to protect its regulation of interstate activities
  * Criminal Civil Rights Laws
    * In *Heart of Atlanta*, Court upheld law that outlawed discrimination by private places of public accommodation (e.g. hotels, restaurants, etc). Court found that only relevant question was whether there was rational basis for finding discrimination by hotels affected interstate commerce and whether the selected means where reasonable and appropriate
      * Reiterated in *McClung*
    * *Perez* upheld Consumer Credit Protection Act because there is no need for proof of effects on interstate commerce, just belief that it is affected. Thus, loan-sharking activities, which often occur interstate, can be regulated under commerce clause powers
    * Question about motive/desired end had constitutional implications

### *US v. Lopez* (1995)

* Majority (Rhenquist)
  * Three categories of activity that can be regulated:
    1. Use of the channels of interstate commerce (i.e. sales directly interstate)
    1. Instrumentalities of interstate commerce (e.g. highways, railroads, things used to conduct commerce across state lines)
    1. Intrastate activities that have a “substantial relation” to interstate commerce
  * Proper test for the third category requires an analysis of whether the regulated activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce
  * Possessing a gun near a school did not substantially affect interstate commerce and thus law was unconstitutional
    * The "soup" of considerations that the majority cites in decision (e.g. concerns about federalism, directness, substantial affects, economic in nature, etc) **leave us with a pretty incoherent framework**
    * **Ultimately concludes that the statute has nothing to do with commerce and lacks jurisdictional element that would ensure its relation to interstate commerce**. It can't be sustained that the activities related here substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate
      * Purpose of the jurisdictional element requirement seems to preventing law from upsetting the balance of federalism
      * While no formal burden to show the effects, majority contends there are no findings that support a basis for the belief
      * Those arguments government presents to show a reasonable basis are dismissed because of there implications for federalism
* Concurrence (Thomas)
  * Rejects the third category and argues for a far more narrow view of congressional power. This would look something like a return to pre-New Deal doctrine
  * Substantially affects standard swallows up all powers in Art. I §8
* Concurrence (Kennedy/O'Connor)
  * Stress principles of limited federalism and importance of preserving intended relationship between congress and state authority
  * Emphasizes that the government had gone too far in that specific instance, but disclaims a formalist test that gives too little weight to the Congressional interest in regulating for the economic well-being in the modern economy
* Dissent (Souter)
  * Majority is saying that the economic character question bears on whether courts defer to Congress (i.e. If non-economic character in question, the no rationality deference to Congress)
    * Rehnquist is wrong in reviewing the Court’s rationale; need to give deference
    * Distinction between what is commercial and non-commercial is return to formalistic jurisprudence from 60 years ago
* Dissent (Breyer) 
  * Criticizes majority for judicial activism and abandoning precedent of last 60 years. Appeals to the rational basis principle that an activity affect interstate commerce and that guns are inherently part of interstate commerce and have economic impact that justifies the regulation

### *US v. Morrison* (2000)

* Background: Violence Against Women Act provided a federal cause of action for violent crimes against women (purely intrastate activity). Congress made extensive legislative findings about the substantial effects of such violence on interstate activity
* Outcome: 3 part test as articulated in *Lopez* is affirmed. Court struck down VAWA, because there was no “substantial relation” to interstate commerce under category 3
* Majority:
  * This is a regulation of non-economic activity and non-economic activity has traditionally been dealt with by state laws
  * Gender-motivated crimes are in no sense economic. There has been no precedent by which aggregate effects of intrastate non-economic activity have been considered and used to uphold regulation of this activity
  * Congress' findings related to the impact on the economy are not sufficient by itself, as allowing Congress to rely on the attenuated effects of a long causal chain would allow them to regulate just about anything
    * Looks a lot like the directness test from Pre-1937
    * Concerns about limits and federalism
* Dissent:
  * Souther stresses deference to congress. Congress has conducted voluminous hearings and found significant effects on the economy.
  
* New limitations following *Lopez* and *Morrison* - Congress cannot regulate **non-economic activity** based on aggregate substantial effects on interstate commerce in areas that have **traditionally been regulated by the states** (i.e. intrastate activity)

### *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005)

* Facts:
  * California’s Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allows for the possession and cultivation of marijuana for medicinal purposes upon physician recommendation
  * Under Controlled Substances Act, manufacture and possession of marijuana is illegal
  * Raich prescribed marijuana for medical purposes; relies on home-grown marijuana; challenges constitutionality of CSA
* Majority (Stevens)
  * Within congressional commerce power if congress has a rational basis to conclude that the activity:
    1. Is part of an economic class of activities that cumulatively has a substantial effect on interstate commerce OR
    1. Even if non-commercial, failure to regulate would undercut the regulation of a greater overall economic activity
  * They find that the greater overall activity that is being regulated (interstate marijuana sales) is of a commercial quality and even if possession is assumed to be non-economic, there is rational basis for believing that not regulating intrastate possession would frustrate (i.e. undercut) the federal interest in regulating the interstate market
  * This distinguishes the case at hand from *Morrison* and *Lopez*
* Concurrence (Scalia)
  * Within congressional commerce power if congress has a rational basis to conclude that the activity:
    1. Activity cumulatively has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and doesn't rely on remote chain of inferences (unless activity is economic) OR
    1. Congress reasonably concludes that activity, if unregulated, could undercut a larger reign of economic activity
  * Determines that this satisfies 2, relying on N&P Clause in addition to the Commerce Clause
* O'Connor (Dissent)
  * Presents a conjunctive test:
    1. Must belong to a class of economic activities AND
    1. Must substantially affect interstate commerce
  * Attacks second prong, though is skeptical about the first as well. Argues that there is an empirical gap in the effects on interstate commerce

### *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012) - Commerce Clause Portion

* Facts:
  * Affordable Care Act requires individuals to purchase health insurance as part of a “three-legged stool” solution: (1) insurer reform; (2) individual mandate; (3) Medicaid expansion
  * Government argues that individual mandate is necessary to prevent cost-shifting by healthy and death spirals caused by adverse selection problem
* Outcome - Individual mandate is an unconstitutional use of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers. Congress may only regulate pre-existing activity and may not compel activity
* Roberts Opinion
  * Must be an activity to be reachable under Commerce Clause, and this individual mandate is not regulating an activity but rather inactivity. Improper for Congress to draw into regulatory sphere those who would be outside it
    * Activity/Inactivity distinction comes from the meaning of "regulate", as you cannot regulate activity that is not taking place
    * Government's logic would allow use of commerce power to compel individuals to act, which would be of significant consequence
  * N&P Clause involves authority derivative of a granted/existing power, where as the individual mandate is the exercise of a "great substantive and independent power"
  * Primary distinction with cases like *Raich* is one of regulating classes of individuals rather than classes of activities:
    * *Raich* dealt with an individual instantiation of a class of activity (i.e. in-state growing and possessing marijuana), however it did not specifically regulate individuals themselves (statute prohibits an activity)
    * *NFIB* is not aimed at any activity in the affirmative sense, but is directed at a class of individuals (i.e. the uninsured). The object of this regulation falls outside of the three categories, as those who haven't purchased health insurance are not "persons involved in interstate commerce"
      * "The individual mandate's regulation of the uninsured as a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to existing commercial activity"
* Ginsburg
  * Recites formulation of the rule. Congress has power to regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. When appraising this legislation, ask only whether there is rational basis for concluding substantial effects AND whether there is reasonable connection between regulatory means and asserted ends.
    * Only invalidate laws upon plain showing that Congress acted irrationally
  * The word regulate can mean to “direct,” which is to tell people what to do [precedent is in *Seven-Sky*]. Also, this is regulation of activity because everyone actively involved in healthcare market or engages in self-insurance when not purchasing from company
    * We got rid of formulas and line-drawing because of their limitations, but Roberts bringing back activity/inactivity distinction
  * Fundamental precept: Congress has sufficient regulatory authority to meet the economic needs of the nation in all cases where uniform measures are necessary (see Madison)
    * Majority decision does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solution it devised for the health care problem
* Scalia
  * Cannot regulate or “direct” commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence
  * Distinguishes Raich because here there are multiple ways of achieving regulatory goals
  * Fundamental precept: Federal government cannot do everything; enumerated powers

---

## 10th Amendment

* Two approaches on 10th amendment as limit on congressional power
  1. 10th Amendment is not a separate constraint on Congress, but rather a reminder that Congress my only legislate if it has authority under the constitution. No independent basis for invalidating on 10th Amendment grounds, this merely means Congress has exceeded the scope of powers delegated in Article I
  1. 10th Amendment protects state sovereignty from federal intrusion and is a key mechanism for maintaining the appropriate balance of power/federalism and states power. Zone of activity for state's exclusive control and any federal laws that intrude are unconstitutional
* Benefits of protecting state sovereignty from intrusion
  1. Decreasing likelihood of federal tyranny - Is this still as important in modern national market economy?
  1. Enhancing democratic rule by providing government that is closer to the people - However, consider Madison's concern about factions of special interests dominating local levels of government
  1. Allowing states to be labs for new ideas - When is it worth experimenting if rights/liberties are at stake?

### Restricting Laws of General Applicability

* As a general rule, Congress may regulate states as a part of a regulatory regime of “general applicability” that applies to private actors and the states equally. No immunity for States; treated just like private parties except when the political safeguards breakdown
* *New York v. United States* [NY I] (1946)
  * Facts: State of NY bottles and sells mineral water; taxed via 1932 Revenue Act §615(a)(5)
  * Holding: - The State of New York is not immune from this federal tax since it is operating a mineral spring in a conservation effort
    * “No restriction upon Congress to include the States in levying a tax exacted equally from private persons upon the same subject matter.”
  * **Non-discriminatory rule**: can’t tax State activities while leaving the same activities by private parties untaxed; cannot treat the States worse than private parties
  
* *National League of Cities v. Usery* (1976)
  * Background:
    * The only case between 1937 and the 1990s to deviate and find that a law violated the 10th Amendment
    * Issue was whether Congress could enforce FLSA requirements of minimum wage against State governments
  * Outcome:
    * Court held that Congress violates 10A when it interferes with traditional state and local government functions, though it did not specifically define what these functions were
    * Binary rule: Where X = traditional or integral function of state government -> Yes to regulating if X, and no to regulating if ~X
    * J. Blackmun, who was the deciding vote, said he viewed majority decision as a balancing test in which exercise of federal power would be permissible in areas where the federal interest is demonstrably greater than that in protecting state sovereignty
  * Cases following *Usery* provided clarification and narrowed the scope of this ruling
    * *Hodel* made it clear that it applied only when Congress was regulating state governments, not private conduct. Must regulate states as states an not directly impair ability to perform essential functions
    * *United Transportation* further narrowed this application so that only violates 10A when would be likely to hamper the state government's ability to fulfill its role in the Union
  
* *Garcia v. SAMTA* (1985) - *Usery* expressly overturned in
  * FLSA imposed min wage and max hours on county public mass transit system in Texas
  * > We therefore now reject, as unsound in principle and unworkable in practice, a rule of state immunity from federal regulation that turns on a judicial appraisal of whether a particular government function is 'traditional' or 'integral'.
    * Concern that it invites imposition of judicial will based on policies it prefers and ones it doesn't
    * Protection of state prerogatives should be through the political process
      * Political safeguards of federalism: ordinary political process can be relied upon to keep Congress in check and prevent overly burdensome rules from being applied to the States
  * **Exception**: when the political safeguards break down, though not clear when that will be (dissent hits on this)
    * > It must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a “sacred province of state autonomy.”
  * *Garcia* is still good law, means that that laws of general applicability can constitutionally apply to the states
  
* *Gregory v. Ashcroft* (1991) - Rule of construction to avoid preemption conflicts
  * If Congress wishes to regulate a core state function, it must make its intent "unmistakably clear" in the statutory text
  * The Court did not use the Tenth Amendment to invalidate the federal law on its face or as applied. Instead, the Court used the Tenth Amendment and federalism considerations as a rule of construction
  * Stressed significance of 10A as constitutional protector of state sovereignty

### Anti-Commandeering Principle (*New York* and *Printz*)

* *New York v. United States* [New York II] (1992)
  * Law requires states to pass laws regulating disposal/treatment of radioactive waste, those that failed to comply would take legal title to the waste
  * Court held the Act was unconstitutional because it attempts to commandeer the States by imposing option to either properly dispose of or take title to waste. **Congress cannot command/compel States to enact or administer federal regulatory program**
    * **Electoral accountability principle** - Basis for anti-commandeering principle. If state is effectuating congress' will, recourse for voters is not clear. Voting state legislators out of office will have little effect if congress is pulling the strings
  * While central holding is that it is unconstitutional for Congress to compel state legislatures to adopt laws or state agencies to adopt regulations. The Court, however, indicated that Congress was not powerless
    * Congress may set standards that state and local governments must meet and thereby preempt state and local actions
    * Also, Congress may attach strings on grants to state and local governments and these conditions induce state and local actions that it cannot directly compel
  
* *Printz v. United States* (1997)
  * Congress creates CLEOs (chief level enforcement officers) in each state to enforce gun background check system on people
  * **Modalities of interpretation** - Both the majority and dissent in Printz agree that the proper interpretive modalities to resolve the question are:
    1. Text - What constitutional provisions speak to the issue
    1. History - Historical practice
    1. Structure - Gesture towards framers intent for internal features and logic inherent to new government. What its like and must have in order to operate successfully
    1. Precedent
  * Majority - Unconstitutional to command state executive officials to enforce a federal regulation
    * Text - No specific enumeration in text; Residual state sovereignty is implicit in text; Not proper under N&P
    * Historical - Congress has not traditionally commanded the states and Federalist Papers do not support commandeering power
    * Structural
      * System of dual sovereignty and horizontal separation of powers. Experience under AoC persuaded them that using States as instruments of federal governance was ineffective. Explicitly chose constitution that confers power upon Congress to regulate citizens, not states. Its power would be augmented immeasurably if able to control police officers of the 50 states, increasing risk of tyranny
      * Congress cannot bypass executive powers of enforcing laws, as this disrupts balance of powers. Constitution vests all executive power in executive branch and congress has impermissibly delegated it to states without meaningful presidential control
    * Precedent - NYII establishes anti-commandeering; same electoral accountability issues exist in this case
    * Rejects balancing test - wants to limit room for subjectivity and judicial will
  * Dissent - Same modalities support upholding the law

## 11th Amendment Sovereign Immunity

### Overview

* 11th Amendment
  * > The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign state
  * As interpreted, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits suits in federal courts against state governments in law, equity, or admiralty, by a state's own citizens, by citizens of another state, or by citizens of foreign countries
  * Additionally, 1999 SCOTUS decision held sovereign immunity bars suits against state governments in state court without their consent
  * The Court thus has ruled that there is a broad principle of sovereign immunity that applies in both federal and state courts; the Eleventh Amendment is a reflection and embodiment of part of that principle
  * **Still no agreement on its proper scope**
  
* Possible scopes of 11A - Modern court likely split between 2 and 3
  1. Federal judicial power does not extend to suits against State A by citizen of State B (citizens can still sue own states)
  1. Federal diversity jurisdiction does not cover suits against states (narrower restriction on subject matter jurisdiction)
  1. Federal judicial power does not extend to suits against State A by ANY person (most expansive)
  
* Expansive Reading
  * Effectively immunizes the actions of state governments from federal court review, even when a state violates the most fundamental constitutional rights
  * protects state autonomy by immunizing states fromm suits in federal court, but it provides this independence by risking the ability to enforce basic federal rights
  * Virtually the entire class of modern civil rights litigation plausibly might be barred by an expansive reading of the immunity of the states from suit in federal court
  
* Response to the limitations imposed by sovereign immunity
  * Supreme Court has devised a number of ways to circumvent the broad prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment and to ensure federal court review of allegedly illegal state actions
  * Three primary mechanisms for circumventing the Eleventh Amendment and allowing federal courts to ensure state compliance with federal law:
    1. Allowing suits against state officers
    1. Permitting states to waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity and consent to suit
    1. Sanctioning litigation against the states pursuant to statutes adopted under the Fourteenth Amendment
  
* Underlying policy issues
  * Supporters of sovereign immunity argue it was a principle that predates the Constitution and is part of its very structure; Safeguarding state governments, and particularly their treasuries, is deeply embedded in the Constitution; There are other ways of holding state govts accountable, such as suits against state officers and suits by the federal govt
  * Opponents argue that it is a principle not found in the text or intended by framers; It wrongly favors govt immunity over accountability and is inconsistent with notion of a govt under law; People can be deprived of rights but left with no remedy and thus no due process; States can violate the Constitution and nowhere be held accountable
  * Kennedy addresses concerns in Alden v. Maine
    * > The constitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign immunity in its own courts does not confer upon the State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution...The States and their officers are bound by obligations imposed by the Constitution...We are unwilling to assume the States will refuse to honor the Constitution...The good faith of the States thus provides an important assurance [of constitutional supremacy]
    * Opponents argue this trust into the good faith of state govts is misplaced and they must be held accountable when violating constitution

### Cases (*Chisolm*, *Hans*, and *Alden v. Maine*)

* *Chisholm v. Georgia* (SCOTUS 1793)
  * Overview:
    * SC citizen held debt in GA from Revolutionary War and wants payment from GA. Sues state of GA directly in Supreme Court
    * Court accepts jurisdiction, holding GA does not have sovereign immunity from the suit
    * Interprets Article III as authorizing private citizen to sue another State w/o its consent
  * Arguments
    * Framers intent - No record of debate at Convention. Issue raised at ratification debates with several signers arguing states are suable
    * Sovereignty - Immunity is inherent in nature of sovereignty (Hamilton in Fed Papers). Jay, CJ - In the US, people not states are sovereign
    * Justice - Would harm principle of free/equal national government and its objective of ensuring justice for all
    * History - No immunity in ancient Greece
  * Response to decision
    * GA legislators are outraged. Congress immediately proposes action
    * 11th Amendment (ratified in 1794) enacted to overrule the holding in this case
  
* *Hans v. Louisiana* (SCOTUS 1890)
  * Holding:
    * **11A bars citizens from suing their own State under federal question jurisdiction**
      * Endorses broadest of the three possible scopes proposed above
    * Reasoning
      * Interpretative modality is structural/non-textualism
      * Implicit sovereign immunity is a necessary principle **separate from text of 11A**
        * Sovereign immunity is a consitutional limitation placed on federal judicial power in Article III
      * 11A only talks about “citizens of another state,” so Hans (P) would have won on purely textualist interpretation
    * Inconsistent with "diversity only" interpretation of the scope, which states that sovereign immunity does not apply to federal question jurisdiction because *Chisolm* and 11A were only aimed at modifying diversity
    * Has been reaffirmed over last century despite calls to overturn it
  
* Limitations on *Hans* and Expansive Scope
  * Suits by U.S. or by other states
    * If sued by state, it must be doing so to protect own interests
  * No immunities for municipalities or state political subdivisions
    * Significant because much of the social service in our country are administered at this level
  
  * **Suits for injunctive relief that name state officials**
    * *Ex parte Young* is credited with establishing principles that 11A does not precluded suits against state officers for injunctive relief, even if the remedy will enjoin the implementation of an official state policy
      * Court reasoned suits against state officers for injunctive relief are not against the state and hence not barred
      * **Cannot be for money damages since that comes out of the State treasury**
      * Need this necessary fiction to make Constitution and federal laws binding on the states
    * *Edelman v. Jordan* (1974)
      * Suit against IL State commissioner of DPW charging violation of federal standards for processing welfare applications
      * Held: Injunction requiring future compliance okay; injunction requiring payment of illegally withheld sums barred
      * Prospective/retrospective distinction
        * **11A does not prohibit fed court from providing injunctive relief against state officer even though compliance with the injunction will cost state great deal of money in future (prospective relief)**
        * Still prohibits awarding retroactive relief--damages to compensate for past injury--when those damages will come out of state treasury
    * Has become primary way of ensuring state compliance with federal law
  
  * **Abrogation**
    * Argument that Congress should be able to override 11A and authorize suits against states in fed court because 11A is a limit on the federal judiciary's power, not on Congress. Federal statutes are supreme over the states
    * By legislation enacted under 14A5
      * *Fitzgerald v. Bitzer* (1976): **14A5 overrides 11A since enacted later in time and abrogates state sovereign immunity**
        * When suing under Equal Protection Clause of 14A, Congress can allow damage suits against States for violations
      * *Quern v. Jordan* (1979) - Intent to abrogate must be clear
    * By legislation enacted under Art. I Powers
      * *Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.* (1989): Congress can abrogate State sovereign immunity under Commerce Clause
        * Congress can authorize suits against the State pursuant to any of its constitutional powers
      * *Seminole Tribe of FL v. FL* (1996): **Congress may only abrogate States’ sovereign immunity when acting under 14A5 powers**
        * Overrules *Union Gas Go.*
      * *Central Virginia CC v. Katz* (2006) - **No state sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings**
        * Art. I §8 powers to create uniform bankruptcy rules override state sovereign immunity. It wasn't the Bankruptcy Act abrogating sovereign, but the fact that such proceedings arise under constitutional bankruptcy powers given to Congress
  
  * **Waiver and Consent**
    * States may always consent to suit
      * No constructive waivers - must be explicit waiver of immunity from suit in federal court in order to be effective
  
* *Alden v. Maine* (1999) - States cannot be sued in state court without their consent
  * Background: Probation officers sue State of Maine for violating FLSA overtime provisions. Fed case dismissed, so file in Maine state courts. Provision in FLSA allowing private action for monetary damages against parties that violate
  * Holding: - Congress cannot subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts
  * Kennedy Majority
    * 11th Amendment is only evidentiary; reminds us of principle of state sovereignty
      * "Sovereign immunity derives not from the 11A but from the structure of the original Constitution itself"
      * *Chisenholm* was wrongly decided from the get-go, and 11A only stood to correct it
    * States enjoyed sovereignty prior to ratification of Constitution and later amendments
      * General sense in which Constitution preserves state sovereignty
    * Text of Constitution nor precedent indicate Congress has power to subject the states to suits within their own courts --> laws must be valid in order to be supreme at fed. level
    * Silence in historical record shows Framers understood Congress to lack this power
      * Unthinkable to suggest states would have ratified with understanding that they could be subjected suits in their own court system
    * No early Congresses subjected states to suit in their own courts
    * Many SCOTUS 11A cases implicitly relied on conception of sovereign immunity
    * **Power would be inconsistent w/ constitutional structure because assault on state dignity**
    * States cannot disregard federal law: (1) may consent to suit; (2) US may sue; (3) Bitzer is still good law; (4) sub-state entities not protected via sovereign immunity; (5) Ex Parte Young necessary fiction still exists

## Tax Power

* General Rule: Tax upheld if reasonably related to revenue production or Congress has power to regulate the activity taxed
  * Must either raise revenue or  regulate pursuant to enumerated power
  * Cannot be a penalty
* The use of Congress' tax power as a backdoor when commerce power is unavailable is arguably more important than the outright exercise of tax power itself
* Historically there were distinctions between direct and indirect taxes as well as between revenue raising and regulatory taxes
  * Constitution holds that direct tax (e.g. capitation, poll tax) must be apportioned among the states based on the census, thus it mattered
    * Passage of 16th Amendment changes this, as apportionment no longer matters. Thus, court abandons this direct/indirect distinction
    * Regulatory/revenue-raising distinction was judicially created
      * Distinction is inherently arbitrary and a false dichotomy - it can be both at the same time
      * Court in *McCrary* - If tax within lawful power, that power may not be judicially restrained because of results from its exercise
        * Ancillary effects don't matter so long as it is an actual tax
      * Court in *Sonzinsky* - Every tax is regulatory by some measure. Inquiry into the hidden motives behind Congress' enactment of a tax is "beyond the competency of the courts"
        * Thus, the Court rejects a standard that would require a case-by-case pretextual analysis (as some would argue is necessary in light of *McCulloch*) on grounds that doing so is not judicially manageable
  * **These distinctions are no longer significant in determining constitutionality of a tax imposed by Congress**

### Constitutional Basis

* **Art. I, §8 Cl. 1** – “Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises…but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.”
* **Art. I, §2**– direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective number
* **Art. I, §9**– no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census.

### *United States v. Kahriger* (1953)

* Facts:
  * Revenue Act of 1951 levies tax on gamblers by requiring persons who have engaged in accepting wagers to register IRS. This was a tax on private individuals
  * Ps challenge the constitutionality of the tax, arguing it is an improper attempt to penalize intrastate activity under the pretense of exercising tax powers
* Outcome - Valid tax because all provisions of excise are adapted to the collection of revenue
* Rule - **Unless there are provisions extraneous to any tax need, courts are without authority to limit taxing power of Congress**. Nominal tax is a tax so long as it produces some revenue, unless penalty provisions extraneous to any tax need (not clear what this would look like)
* Majority Reasoning
  * Court recognizes few constraints on tax power. Power to tax is not questioned, nor is power to impose penalties for non-payment of taxes
    * Court also recognizes *McCulloch* and its duty to prevent Congress from accomplishing an object outside of its constitutional authority under the pretext of executing its lawful powers
    * However, in the regulation of commerce, Congress has long been able to effect matters that are ordinarily of state concern. Why should tax powers be more limited with respect to its effects on traditional state matters? Court says it shouldn't
    * Here, all provisions of this excise were adapted to the collection of a valid tax. Other regulatory provisions (e.g. registering) are in aid of collection purpose, thus are also not extraneous to any tax need
  * Regulatory effect of tax does not have a bearing on whether tax is legitimate; it produces revenue, which is consistent with other taxes the court has declared valid
* Concurrence (Jackson) - Argues that he is concurring only because the dissent goes too far by proposing a standard that would impair the legitimate tax power of Congress
  * Difficult to regard tax as rational revenue measure, despite deference due to Congress (pretext)
  * It is dangerous to jeopardize public trust in the tax system by using it as an instrument to achieve unauthorized ends
  * However, it is more dangerous to impair those tax powers that are legitimate though an excessively strict judicial standard
  * The former can be corrected democratically ("the evil that can come from this statute will probably soon manifest itself to Congress"), but the latter is much more difficult ("this evil might not be transient"). Thus, the majority is the lesser of two evils
* Dissent (Frankfurter) - Courts can step in when legislation appears truly regulatory rather than revenue-seeking. Ulterior purpose cannot be stated in ways negating revenue words expressed on their face

### NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) - Individual Mandate Tax Portion

* Facts:
  * Affordable Care Act imposes an penalty on individuals whom do not purchase health insurance coverage. Earlier in the opinon, the court held that this individual mandate was an invalid exercise of Congress' commerce power. Thus, the Court moves on and considers whether it can be justified under Congress' tax power
* Outcome - Individual mandate is within Congress’s taxing powers
* Rule - **Irrelevant that this part of the legislation was not explicitly designated as a tax. Constitutionality of action by congress does not depend on recitals of power which it undertakes to exercise** When determined that Congress permits a tax, not role of courts to forbid tax or judge
* Majority (Roberts)
  * References principle of construction articulated by Judge Story in which a court should avoid adopting interpretations that would make it unconstitutional in favor of one that would make it valid, regardless if unintentional
  * Mandate looks like a tax in many respects. Is assessed and collected in same manner
  * While lack of "tax" label may be fatal to enforcement of Anti-Injuction Act, this is not fatal in viewing it as an exercise of tax powers
  * Functional analysis used in prior cases also support this conclusion
    * Not a penalty because not an exceeding burden (never more than price of coverage), no scienter requirement, and IRS handles tax
  * Not a punishment for criminal act or omission, failing to purchase coverage is not a crime; Taxes may be regulatory and seek to shape decisions (i.e. incentives)
  * Taxing inaction is not troubling because constitution is clear you cannot avoid taxes thru inactivity (capitation is explicitly authorized; people are taxed merely for existing)
  * Limit on taxing power of Congress is that it be non-penalizing in nature. Can't sanction or imprison under tax powers like with commerce powers
* Dissent (Scalia)
  * No way to read the statute as a tax, but rather it is a mandate enforced via penalty
    * The words shall and penalty denote a sanctioned prohibition or punishment
  * There as a clear line between penalty and tax in Court's decisions; its either one or the other and Congress clearly framed it as a penalty
    * To interpret the mandate as a tax goes beyond construction; it is to re-write it
    * Case comes down to language of statute; if called tax rather than penalty, no issues
  * Anti-Injunction Act not a problem because there is no tax
    * Critical of Majority reasoning that holds the mandate is not a tax for purposes of AIA, but is a tax for Constitutional powers

## Spending Power

* Art. I, §8, Cl. 1 – “Congress shall have Power…to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.”
  
* Main Rule: **Congress possesses expansive power to spend in any way it believes would serve the general welfare so long as it does not violate another constitutional provision**
  * This broad scope of Congress' spending powers was articulated in *Butler* reaffirmed in subsequent cases
  * In *Sabri*, court upheld law prohibiting bribery of state/local officials officials that receive greater than $10k in federal funds, even if the bribery was unrelated to activities that the funding is for. Court argued that money is fungible and bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of public funds and thus Congress has power to bear federal power on individuals who convert public funds for personal gain
  
* Conditions on state grants
  * General Rule: **Court has held that Congress may place conditions on such grants, so long as the conditions are expressly stated, have some relationship to the purpose of the spending program, and are not unduly coercive**
  * While having no power to regulate state and local political activities, it does have power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to states shall be disbursed
  * In *Halderman*, court held that if Congress intends to impose a condition on federal grant money, it **must be unambiguous and expressly stated** so that states know the consequences of their choosing to take federal funds
  * Court recognized that at some point, "the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion"
    * Court has recently continued to enforce this limitation on Congress' power to put conditions on grants: **They cannot be unduly coercive**
  
* Anticoercion Principle: If a State really has no choice other than to accept the package, then the offer is coercive and cannot be sustained under the spending power. [Joint dissent in *NFIB*]
  * Need this principle in case coercion is used to confer benefit getting State to waive a right
    * Anticoercion = anticompulsion = magnitude of pressure (~Y) is too burdensome (NFIB) --> Compulsion
    * Anticoercion = antiextortion = withholding benefit (~Y) is wrongful (Nollan) --> Coercion
* Conditional Offer Problem: Federal government conditions a benefit that it is not constitutionally obligated to provide on the offeree’s relinquishment of some constitutionally protected interest or right
  * Example: Plea bargaining
  * Federal government provides some benefit X if and only if State does not exercise some right Y
  * Tension:
    1. Greater power not to off any benefit includes lesser power to confer some benefit by condition
    1. Shouldn’t do indirectly through compulsion what government cannot do directly
  * Duty holder cannot act to make exercise of my right more costly

* Relatedness Requirement
  * > "Germaneness of the condition to the federal purpose" - *Dole*
  * **To satisfy relatedness test, the conditioned imposed must not be unrelated to the purpose behind which the funds are expended**
  * Example: The purpose of highway funding is safe interstate travel, a purpose that can be frustrated by the drinking age if a state has set it too low. Thus, the condition that states increase drinking age is related to the purpose federal highway funding
  * Court in *Dole* declines to define outer limits of germaneness and hold that conditions on federal funds is legitimate only if it relates **directly** to the purpose of the expenditure to which it is attached

### *United States v. Butler* (1936)

* Facts:
  * Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 regulated production and consumption of agricultural commodities using tax on processors and subsidies to farmers
* Holding:
  * Unconstitutional because it used legitimate means to an unconstitutional end.
* Rule:
  * Substantive power to spend is broad, and only limited in that it shall be used to provide for the general welfare of the United States
* Majority (Roberts)
  * Court endorses Hamiltonian view, asserting that Congressional spending power is not limited by direct grants of power in Constitution
    * Proceeds to directly contradict itself by accepting Madisonian reasoning to conclude that such exercise of powers is used to achieve unconstitutional end (that reserved by states) and thus violates 10A
      * That right is the ability of the State to regulate production (*Carter Coal* is still good law at this point in history)
  * Rejects government's contention that regulation was voluntary. Instead, holds that it was coercive by economic pressure
    * Cost of refusal would is the loss of benefits, would be financially ruinous -> those who do accept subsidies would be able to undersell him
    * Coercion = pressure where power to confer or withhold benefit is power to destroy
  * While Government has clear right to appropriate money through contracts with individuals, expenditures for proper governmental purpose (i.e. for general welfare) can't be used to justify contracts not within federal power. Contracts **for** the reduction of acreage are outside the range of that power
    * There is obvious difference between statute stating conditions upon which money shall be expended and one that requires individual to submit to otherwise impermissible regulation in order for it to have effect (actually doing vs. agreeing to do)
    * Hamilton himself would not have even suggested that power granted in Constitution could be used for destruction of local/state power
    * Government's interpretation effectively argues that, after all the effort framers took to limit and delineate federal powers, they intended to wipe it all away with clause, that granting tax and spending powers, that would allow federal gov to ignore those barriers
* Dissent:
  * No support for the idea that the spending program is coercive
    * Essence of economic coercion is  threat of loss rather than hope of gain
    * This looks more like inducement
  * The legitimate ends in the case is the promotion of national general welfare thorough spending. This is an enumerated power, so it shouldn't be a problem
* Notes
  * Madisonian view: Tax and spending power confined to enumerated powers committed to Congress. Can only be used to achieve regulatory ends otherwise available as an enumerated legislative power
  * Hamiltonian: Tax and spending power distinct from others enumerated; only limit is that it must provide for the general welfare of the United States

### *Steward Machine Co. v. Davis* (1937)

* Facts: Title IX of Social Security Act taxes total wages payable to employer; allows 90% credit for contributions to a state unemployment fund created under state law
* Outcome: Act upheld as within Congress’s broad spending power
* Rule: Spending power broad, but cannot be coercive (point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement)
Majority (Cardozo):
  * No coercion because states choosing to enact legislation at their own will w/o compulsion
  * Distinguishes Butler:
    1. Funds not earmarked for a special group [i.e. Butler was for farmers]
    1. States enact their own legislation;
    1. Condition not aimed at unlawful end;
    1. States may repeal laws
  * Congress can use spending power to achieve ends it could not otherwise achieve directly
* Dissent (McReynolds)
  * States should be free to exercise sovereignty w/o interference from federal government
  * Decision here is practical annihilation of vertical separation of powers; allows anything
* Dissent (Sutherland)
  * Tax is within powers and not coercive
  * 10A infringed because conditional agreement with states asks them to surrender power over lawmaking
* Notes
  * Coercion as a wrong is a normative principle not explicitly in Constitution

### *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987)

* Facts: Conditional grant says enact min. drinking age of 21 or 5% highway funds withheld.
  * South Dakota allows 19 year olds to purchase beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol.
* Outcome: Statute making conditional offer is constitutional.
* Rule: Spending Power Test
  1. **Must be for general welfare w/ substantial deference to Congressional judgment**
  1. **Unambiguous conditions allow States to exercise choice**
  1. **Conditions must be related to federal interest in particular national program**
  1. **May not violate other constitutional provisions [activity of States constitutional]**
  1. **Coercion - Not so coercive as to pass point at which pressure turns into compulsion**
* Majority (Rhenquist)
  * First 3 easily satisfied: Clearly in pursuit of general welfare because prevents young drunks driving across borders; Conditions clearly stated in unambiguous terms; Conditions related to federal interest in highway safety by withholding funds
  * Is 21A an independent constitutional bar?
    * Recognizes that post-*Butler*, court has held that 10A limitation on regulating state affairs did not concomitantly limit range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants
      * No violation of State sovereignty where state could adopt the "simple expedient" of not yielding to what it urges is federal coercion
    * "Independent constitutional bar limitation...is not a prohibition on the indirect achievement of objects which Congress is not empowered to achieve directly. **Instead, power may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional**
      * So such thing is occurring here
  * Is the conditional grant coercive?
    * No because relatively small percentage of funds withheld; this is merely “mild encouragement”
* Dissent (O’Connor)
  * Issue with related purpose – drinking age is not related to road construction
  * Conditional grants should only specify how money should be spent, but nothing else
  * If not a condition, then a regulation, which is valid only if falls within delegated powers
* Dissent (Brennan)
  * Statute infringes on 21A and the State constitutional power to regulate in this area
* Notes:
  * Relatedness requirement of conditional spending does the most work; bi-conditional offer
  * Would have been lawful under Commerce Clause, but 21A might prevent this
  * Spending power can get around the *Lopez* and *Printz* laws

### *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012) - Spending Portion

* Facts: Medicaid expansion making States cover all under 65 w/ incomes below 133% of federal poverty; condition is withholding all of the States’ Medicaid funding
* Outcome: Medicaid expansion program unconstitutional under spending power
* Rule:
  * **State must voluntarily and knowingly accept terms of to be constitutional spending use**
  * **Pressure so great that there is no meaningful choice --> Coercion**
* Majority (Roberts)
  * Too coercive; more than mild encouragement, it is a “gun to the head” - accounts for 20% of State's budget
    * Rejects dissent's contention that this is merely expanding the existing program; Holds that this is essentially an entirely new program - unforeseeable expansion to States
      * This is highly disputable - Medicaid has always been means tested
    * No real choice for the States in participating in the program
      * Similar to *New York II*, where condition to participate in federal regulatory program was viewed as an illusory choice
    * No need to fix a line because wherever it is, this is clearly beyond it
    * Do not need to invalidate all of ACA b/c of the severability clause
* Dissent (Ginsburg)
  * States have no entitlement to receive Medicaid funding and Congress can set limits
  * Medicaid Act has been amended 50+ times increasing coverage; this is no different
  * Coercion is not a part of the Dole test; was merely dicta
  * Just a way for political judgments defying judicial calculation to enter the test
* Joint Dissent: Need to limit broad spending power with coercion because can’t blur political accountability
  * Coercive: If States really have no choice other than to accept the package
  * Should not be severable b/c it is critical to the overall goal of universal coverage
* Notes: Legal rationale for the anti-coercion principle
  * Political accountability [idea from New York II]
    * Problem is that accountability calculations harder w/ hard choice vs. no choice
    * Biggest political accountability issue arises when the choice is actually okay
  * Contract principles require voluntariness
    * Magnitude of the pressure cannot be used to void a contract via unvoluntariness
    * To void contract, would need a real big pressure and wrongful threat
  * Dole precedent: Coercive when pressure becomes compulsion
    * Not good law b/c coercion was not used in Dole as a factor to reach holding
  * Structure of Conditional Grants
    * If C, then B = Offer
    * If ~C, then ~B = Threat
    * If ~B is too burdensome, then exceeds spending power
  * In this case, ~C is the right. Gov cannot compel C because *Printz* says cannot commandeer
  * Berman: Issue not with too much pressure, but wrong to withhold the benefit without legitimate reason
