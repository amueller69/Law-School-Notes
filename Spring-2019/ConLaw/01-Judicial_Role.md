# The Judicial Role

## Judicial Review - Marbury v. Madison

### Marshall Opinion

* Issue 1: Does Marbury have right to judgeship/commission?
  * Legal Premise: You have a legal right to commission once it has been signed and becomes valid
  * Factual Premise: John Marshall (Sec. of State) signed the commission, thereby rendering it valid
  * Conclusion: Marbury has a right
  
* Issue 2: If there is a right, is there also a remedy?
  * There is no question that every legal right necessarily has a legal remedy, as a matter of civil liberty. However, specific issue is whether court could give remedy against executive branch
  * Court draws distinction between when judiciary can and cannot provide remedy: Where there is a specific duty to a particular person but not where it is a political matter left to executive discretion
  
* Issue 3: Can Supreme Court issue this remedy? Is writ of mandamus appropriate?
  * Judicial review and writ of mandamus are only appropriate in the first category described in the distinction above
  * Those executive exercises of power within discretion of president cannot be judicially removed
  
* Issue of Original Jurisdiction
  * Marbury argues that §13 of 1789 Judiciary Act gives Supreme Court original jurisdiction to hear suit for mandamus. Court agrees
    * Is this correct interpretation of the statute? Perhaps it is more plausible that this section refers to appellate jurisdiction since it was the only type explicitly referenced in the preceding text
    * It could also be referring to court's authority to issue writs for cases that it already has original jurisdiction over
    * In these alternative interpretations, Marbury would have lost and court would have lost chance to declare statutes unconstitutional. Perhaps the court's interpretation was strategic?
  
* Does this violate Article III of the Constitution
  * Court holds that Art. 3 enumerates jurisdiction, which can't be enlarged by congress. This includes original jurisdiction for suits involving foreign ministers. Allowing congress to expand beyond that enumerated would be "mere surplusage...entirely without meaning"
    * Congressional power to expand is disputable. Article III might just set a floor rather than a ceiling
    * However, this remains law today
  * Thus, Court says congress could not add mandamus cases to the list enumerated in Art 3., meaning Judiciary Act of 1789 violates Constitution

* Can Supreme Court declare laws unconstitutional?
  * Having found statute violates constitutional, question asked is "whether an act, repugnant to the Constitution, can become the law of the land", one that Marshall states is deeply interesting to the US.
  * **“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”**
  * Marshall offers multiple arguments for judicial declaration of unconstitutionality:
    1. Limits on government powers meaningless unless subject to judicial review. Allowing legislature to “do what is expressly forbidden” would give it “omnipotence"
    1. Inherent to the judicial role to decide constitutionality of the laws
    1. "Arising under" implied power to declare unconstitutional laws
    1. Judge take an oath of office that would be violated if they were to enforce unconstitutional laws
    1. Article VI makes constitution the supreme law of the land, meaning it should control over all other laws
* Note that it’s not a given that the judiciary gets to decide whether there is a conflict. Possible interpretations of Marshall’s assertions:
  1. Each branch decides for itself (pluralism)
  1. Each branch is authoritative in its own area of expertise (departmentalism)
  1. A single authoritative interpreter for everybody (supremacy)

### Contemporary Judicial Review

* It’s enough to know that our system has settled on Judicial Supremacy, and Marbury has been read to hold that the judiciary is the authoritative interpreter of when the constitution and laws are in conflict for every branch, and the states
  * Review from state courts, and of state laws (*Hunter’s Lessee* (1816))
  * From *Marbury* to *Cooper v. Aaron* (1958): “\[T\]he federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution”
* Qualifications on Judicial Supremacy
  * Some nods to departmentalism (e.g. deference to other branches on certain issues or imposing prudential limits which effectively allow other branches to control)
  * Asymmetrical: other branches are bound by a holding that a law is unconstitutional, but don’t need to be bound by a holding that a law is constitutional. This allows other branches to operationalize their own judgements where doing so is not unconstitutional

## Judicial Supremacy

* While all government institutions are required to engage in constitutional interpretation, there is the question of who should be the final or most authoritative interpreter. Three [3] options for who gets to decide when there is an ultimate conflict with Constitution:
  * Pluralism - All branches decide for themselves, no single branch is regarded as authoritative
    * This would present obvious difficulties; things would be left unsolved and there would be frequent conflicts
  * Departmentalism - Identity of interpreter changes based on the part of the Constitution at issue
  * Judicial Supremacy - Single authoritative interpreter in the judiciary (i.e. judicial review)

### Arguments for Judicial Supremacy

* Judicial supremacy is (arguably) endorsed by the decision in *Marbury v. Madison*
  * *Marbury* interpreted as saying the judiciary is the authoritative interpreter (See quote above)
  * Marshall outlines several reasons that seem to advocate for 
  * However, the decision can be read as ambiguous and as not resolving the question of whose interpretation controls
    * Says nothing about whether other branches are bound to follow the Court's interpretation
  
* Hamilton also makes argument in Federalist No. 78
  * Points out that judges are insulated from political pressures and the judiciary has the function/duty of interpreting the laws
    * Least dangerous and offensive to political rights of the constitution due to a smaller capacity to annoy them. It has no influence over the sword or purse. It has neither force nor will, but merely judgement
    * The permanent tenure and thus insulation from political pressure contributes to the independent spirit of the judiciary
  * Complete independence of the courts is essential in a limited constitution. Its duty must be to declare all acts contrary to the Constitution void
    * Congress derives power from Constitution, therefore no legislative act Contrary to it can be valid
    * Rather than having representatives substitute their own will for that of their constituents when exercising judgement, its more reasonable to suppose that the intended role of the courts is to keep legislature within limits of assigned authority
    * Interpretation of laws is the proper province of the court and Constitution is to be preferred where conflicts with laws exist
  * Courts are thus an intermediary between the people and the Constitution - Does not suppose power of courts is superior to legislature (i.e. ability to overrule), but simply that power of the people is superior to both and the will of the people is reflected in the constitution
    * Exercise judgment (objective/reason) over will (subjective/desire)
    * Must declare the sense of the law and act as a safeguard against partial/unjust laws that threaten the rights of particular classes of citizens
      * Operates as a check against legislature, who in perceiving expected obstacles from the scruples of the court, become compelled to qualify their attempts
  
* **Will vs. Judgment** – why judges are better suited to exercise judgment over will:
  * Permanent judicial tenure insulates from political pressures
  * Training and expertise necessary for a judicial role aid in constitutional interpretation
  * Status and prestige comes with doing a good job as opposed to popularity among constituents
  * Courts have a different temporal posture and look at things later on; not “in the moment”
  * Judicial craft = manner of reaching and defending its views. However, legal realism allows for manifestation of the will

* **Counter-majoritarian difficulty**
  * Undemocratic to have unelected judges overturn popularly adopted laws
  * However, this is an **objection to constitutionalism**, not judicial review itself. The constitution is always counter-majoritarian anytime popular will diverges from the constitution
  * Courts are still responsive to this concern, which undergirds both the constitutional avoidance cannon and the justiciability doctrines
  
* Limits on Judicial Tyranny
  * Constitutional amendment process via Article V
  * Threat of impeachment via Art. III, §1 and political control of appointment process via Art. II, §2, Cl. 2
  * Norms – belief in limited political capital
  * Political control over jurisdiction via Congress
  * Justiciability rules via “case or controversy” limitations

## Constraints on the Judiciary

### Jurisdictional Stripping

* Congressional reduction of the power of the judiciary by limiting federal jurisdiction via statute
  * Example: No federal jurisdiction to hear challenges of state abortion laws
* Justifications
  * Textual basis - Art.III of Constitution creates “exceptions” clause to SCOTUS appellate jurisdiction
  * Congress has greater power to create lower fed. courts, so must have lesser power over their jurisdiction
  * Can’t remove jurisdiction for all courts since constitutional rights must allow some court for due process
* Counterarguments
  * Circumvents Marbury; gets around judicial review and court supremacy in constitutional interpretation
* It’s not exactly clear whether Congress can do this. The best answer is probably that due process requires some forum for judicial review, but state-only jurisdiction might satisfy  

### Justiciability

* Justiciability doctrines determine which matters federal court can hear and decide and which must be dismissed
  * Justiciability rules work to keep courts from reaching the merits; dismissal is not a judgment on the merits
  * Constitutional limits cannot be overruled by Congress, such a "cases and controversies" limitation
  * Prudential limits can be overruled by statute
  * Justifications: Separation of powers, conservation of judicial resources, improve judicial decision making, promote fairness
  * Goal is to strike balance between restraint an review, don't want courts to abdicate parts of their essential function

* **Advisory Opinions**
  * Federal courts will not opine on pending or proposed government action or legislation
  * Based on “cases or controversies” text in Article III, §2; questions are not cases or controversies
    * Counter: text may just represent a minimum; doesn’t say judiciary should “only” exercise judicial power
  * Justifications
    * Erroneous advisory opinions can be costly (facts alter decision, composition of court changes, time passes)
      * Adversarial argumentation is the engine of truth-finding; don’t have that here
    * Conserve judicial resources; opportunity cost b/c not able to hear as many live disputes
    * Follows separation of powers by keeping courts out of the legislative process
  * Not an advisory opinion when (1) actual dispute between adverse parties and (2) substantial likelihood of decision favoring claimant will bring about some change or effect
    * This means declaratory judgements are not categorically prohibited under this doctrine
  
* **Standing**
  * Determines whether a person is the proper party to bring a matter before the court for adjudication
  * Rules
    * Constitutional
      * Plaintiff must face concrete injury or the real and immediate threat of one
        * Must be personal injury to common law rights (i.e. contractual, property, or tort-based rights), constitutional rights, or statutory rights
      * Injury caused by D’s conduct - must allege and prove injury is fairly traceable to D's unlawful conduct
      * Redressable by favorable ruling; decision will have an effect likely to remedy the injury
    * Prudential
      * Not a generalized grievance [injury shared in substantially equal measure by all or large class of citizens]
        * Where harm is concrete though widely shared, court has still found injury in fact
      * Does not involve rights of third parties; can't present claims suffered by parties not part of the lawsuit
        * Exceptions: substantial obstacles for injured party, close relationship with injured party, associations on behalf of members
      * Claim must be within the zone of interest protected by the statute in question; must be part of group intended to benefit from law
  * Justifications
    * No harm, no foul for people who do not have a stake in the decision. Prevents people from suing purely on ideological grounds
    * Conserves judicial resources and judicial capital - prevents flood of cases from those not affected
    * Adversarial process is good engine for bringing forward best cases and improves judicial decision-making
    * Promotes fairness to those substantially affected by decision; only raise own rights and concerns and prevents intermeddlers
    * Reduces intra-branch friction by minimizing judicial opportunity to overrule laws or actions
  * Criticisms
    * Causation and redressability - improper determination based on pleadings, unprincipled because dependent on court's characterization of the injury, and that court manipulates these factors based on its view of the merits
    * Generalized grievances can be view as an abdication of judicial role in upholding Constitution
    * Some of the tests have been criticized as unnecessary in light of the others
  
* **Ripeness**
  * Requires the injury to have already occurred; matter cannot be premature for review. This is factored into hardship determination
    * However, may be unfairness in requiring someone to wait and endure harm in order to challenge it
  * Values: (1) separation of powers; (2) judicial economy; (3) decision enhancement (adequate record)
  * Requirements: (1) substantial hardship (harm in denying review); (2) fitness of the issues (legal issues independent of factual context are more likely to be found for ripeness)
  
* **Mootness**
  * An actual controversy must exist at all stages of the federal court proceeding; live and ongoing dispute
  * Rooted in prohibition against advisory opinions: if nothing stands to be resolved
  * Causes: death of a party, settlement, challenged law repealed or expires, or changes in facts
  * Exceptions
    * Secondary or collateral injury survives after primary injury resolved
    * Wrongs capable of repetition yet evading review (i.e. abortion prohibition)
    * Defendant voluntarily ceases alleged improper behavior, but is free to return to it at any time
    * Properly certified class action may continue even after named P’s claims are rendered moot
  
* **Political Questions Doctrine**
  * Subject matter deemed inappropriate for judicial review; unconstitutional government conduct best left to politically accountable branches of government
  * Baker v. Carr Disjunctive Test (only need one)
    * Textually demonstrable commitment of issue to coordinate political department; power to interpret scope
    * Lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards to resolve issue (i.e. partisan gerrymandering)
    * Impossibility of deciding case without initial policy determination of kind clearly for non-judicial discretion
    * Impossibility of court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect for coordinate branches of government
    * Unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made
    * Potentiality of embarrassment for multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question
  * Justifications
    * Conserves judicial resources and judicial capital
    * Preserves separation of powers and avoids controversial constitutional questions
  * Criticism
    * Inappropriate to leave constitutional questions to political branches of government
    * Deference need not mean abdication
