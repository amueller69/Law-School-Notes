# Fundamental Rights Beyond Those Enumerated

* **State Action Doctrine** – constitutional rights apply only to the governments and not to private entities and individuals
* Framers thought Bill of Rights was not necessary
  * Limited government powers via enumeration
  * List of rights would be dangerous because inevitably incomplete, though incorrectly viewed as exhaustive
* Selective incorporation – incorporate rights sufficiently fundamental to apply to states and local governments
  * (1) Must be in the Bill of Rights and (2) must be fundamental protection

| Type | Incorporated Rights | Unincorporated Rights |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Procedural | 4A, 5A, (double jeopardy; self-incrimination), 6A | 5A (grand jury indictment), 7A |
| Substantive | 1A, 2A, 8A | None, but 3A yet to be decided |

* **Procedural due process**, as the phrase implies, refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Classic procedural due process issues concern what kind of notice and what form of hearing the government must provide when it takes a particular action
  
* **Substantive due process** asks whether the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person's life, liberty, or property. In other words, substantive due process looks to whether there is a sufficient justification for the government's action. Whether there is such a justification depends very much on the level of scrutiny used
  * Existence of this has been contested, as some argue "process" denotes procedures and that it is incorrect to use the due process clause as the place for protecting substantive rights. Many argue 14A PIC is the appropriate place for safeguarding substantive rights (Narrow interpretation of PIC in *Slaughterhouse* has precluded this)
    * Critics argue that the Court acts illegitimately when it protects rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution or intended by its framers
    * The use of the doctrine to curb progressive era reforms has also drawn criticism which often fails to be separated from the doctrine itself
  * Defenders argue that it does not put substantive limits on government, but restraints on the executive/legislative powers. The clause does not speak solely of due process but, rather, "due process of law," and it is argued that an action is not in accord with the law of the land if it violates the substantive guarantees of the Constitution
    * The due process clause has been found to incorporate provisions of the Bill of Rights that are deemed fundamental and to protect these rights from state and local interference. This is substantive due process in that it uses the due process clause to protect rights and only allows interference if there is a sufficient justification

* It is possible to distinguish procedural and substantive due process based on the remedy sought. If the plaintiff is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional as violating a constitutional right, substantive due process is involved. But when a person or a group is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional because of the lack of adequate safeguards, such as notice and a hearing, procedural due process is the issue

## First 100 Years

* Three possible interpretations of the 14A PIC might cover:
  * (1) All fundamental rights -> Field and Bradley dissents; Historical and/or moral bases; P&I might cover rights that are fundamental but not explicitly enumerated.
  * (2) Incorporation of BoR (Amendments 1-8) -> Prenumbral view; PIC was meant/should be used to incorporate the enumerated bill of rights protections against the states
  * (3) Incidental national rights -> PI only encompasses rights that arise from the existence of a national government. The narrowest/most restrictive view and the one adopted by the *Slaughterhouse* majority

### *Slaughter House Cases* (1872)

* Facts: After breakout of disease caused by contamination of water supply by waste from a slaughterhouse located near the city, Louisiana passed law that granted a private company a 25-year monopoly in the livestock landing and slaughterhouse business. The law also required that the company allow any person to use the facilities to slaughter animals for a fixed fee. Several butchers brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the grant of a monopoly on the following basis:
  * It established involuntary servitude in violation of 13A
  * It violated the privileges or immunities clause
  * It violated the equal protection clauses of 14A
  * It denied their right to practice their trade and thus violated the due process clause
* Holding - The LA law is constitutional as a valid exercise of state police power
* Majority
  * Power exercised by state is an essential one: the **police power**. While incapable of being precisely defined, this power concerns the security of social order, the life and health of citizens, the beneficial use of property, and the enjoyment of private and social life
    * Authority of state of LA to pass law under this power is valid unless some restraint on the exercise on this power is found on the constitution
  * Not protected by 13A prohibitions against slavery, which was enacted for the purpose of forbidding any and all forms of African slavery. 14A EPC also only intended to protect freed slaves
  * **The PIC of 13A only protects the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the United States and not by the individual states**
    * State and national citizenship are distinct ("of the United States" vs. "of the several states")
    * Article 4 prohibits discrimination against out-of-state citizens with respect to P&Is, but all such individuals treated the same under the LA state law
    * Likewise, 14A PIC prohibits States from abridging the P&Is of citizens of the United States, meaning only those associated with national citizenship
  * Privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States are those which are fundamental; which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several States which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign
    * If the P&Is associated with National citizenship were expanded to included these same rights and thus subjecting the states to congressional control with respect to them, it would greatly disrupt the balance between state and federal governments
    * Thus these P&Is are left to the states to protect and secure and not placed in the special care of the federal government. This does not, however, mean that there exists no such P&Is belonging to national citizenship (e.g. access to seaports, rights while in jurisdiction of foreign government, etc.)
  * Finally, Court emphasized that DPC only concerned the procedures that government must follow and thus could not be used to challenge the law for interfering with the right of butchers to practice their trade
    * Thus, **Court flatly rejects the idea that the due process clause could be used to safeguard a right to practice a trade or profession from arbitrary government interference**
* Dissent (Fields)
  * Majority interpretation of 14A PIC render it a vain and idle enactment, meaningless and accomplishing nothing. It would be impossible for a state to interfere with these narrow category of National P&Is through its laws and there would be no reason to adopt a constitutional provision, thus 14A PIC must be something more
  * Interprets the words "liberty" and "property" in the due process clause of 14A as limiting the ability of states to adopt arbitrary laws that such interfere with one's calling, profession, or trade. This due process protection extends to any laws that interfered with natural rights

## *Lochner* Era

* *Lochner* era – protected rights not specifically provided in Constitution under DPC by means of some form of heightened scrutiny
  * Analyze ends served (permissible; i.e. – police powers) and also the means used (direct and substantial)
  * Unenumerated rights and protection via heightened scrutiny
  * Laissez fair jurisprudence – many laws unconstitutional for interfering w/ freedom to contract; others upheld
* Laws protecting unionizing; protection of maximum hours laws; no minimum wage laws for women; protected business entry; some consumer protection legislation upheld

### *Lochner v. New York* (1905)

* Facts - D violated state law prohibiting bakery employees from working 10+ hours per day or 60 hours per week
* Issue: Is this a fair, reasonable, and appropriate exercise of the police power of the state, or is it an unreasonable, unnecessary, and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty, or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and his family?
* Holding - Statute, restricts free bargaining between employers and employers over hours worked, unjustly interferes with right to freedom of contract protected by 14A DPC
* Rules:
  * **Liberty (right to purchase or to sell labor) and freedom to contract cannot be infringed unless the State directly and substantially serves a police power (health, safety, morals, or general welfare)**
  * Test 
* Majority (Peckham)
  * State has power to prevent individual from making certain kinds of contracts, but only those that it can prohibit in the legitimate exercise of its police power
  * Police powers must have limits to prevent use as a mere pretext; not a reasonable use here
    * The law was passed for ulterior motives of regulating hours of labor in private business. Lacked safety, moral, or health grounds
    * Baking not the type of employment/labor where it is reasonable to interfere, like it is with mining or smelting
    * Health reasons for law, as they apply to either Bakers or the general public, not direct or substantial enough
      * Connection between healthful quality of bread and hours worked is far too tenuous
      * Small amount of unhealthiness; police power would be too broad if we let this in
  * Can’t have economic redistribution where one class is favored over another; freedom of K
* Dissent (Holmes):
  * Test is whether a reasonable person would say statute infringes fundamental principle as they have been understood by traditions of our people and our law - should not function to prevent the exercise of a dominant opinion among states
    * Constitution gives States the power to make their own judgments about what laws are best for their individual citizens
    * Rejects the idea that Constitution should be used to protect a particular economic theory which largely unsupported by the popular will
* Dissent (Harlan) - Majority rule is okay, but law does protect the health of people because exposure to dust and illness
* Notes
  * The Court is applying heightened scrutiny to strike down state legislation. The test requires that the State regulation:
    1. **Serve a legitimate police power** (e.g. public health, safety, morals, welfare, etc.)
    1. The means of achieving this must have a **direct and substantial relationship** to the objective
  * Majority finds that the NY statute fails on the second prong. Limiting the hours of bakers does not promote public welfare or the welfare of bakers in any easily recognizable way. Instead, it limits autonomy to contract
  * **3 Key Themes that Persisted Through *Lochner* Era**:
    * (1) 14A DPC protects freedom to contract
    * (2) Government can only interfere with freedom of contract to serve valid police power
    * (3) Judicial role to carefully scrutinize legislation interfering with liberty
  * Was *Lochner* wrongly decided?
    * Unequal bargaining power may mean no real freedom to contract
      * However, even if directed at labor protections of bakers, could be viewed as protecting a particular class of individuals at the expense of another. Thus this would not be a permissible police powers objective since it doesn't have a net benefit to the public and merely redistributes
    * Inconsistent application of this doctrine leads to unpredictable and nonsensical results
    * Judiciary should not be invalidating laws adopted through democratic process; judicial values substituted (Excessive judicial activism by unelected judges)
    * Concerns over judicial heightened scrutiny and counter-majoritarian difficulty
    * Seems to have disregarded the “without due process” part of the 14A

### Cases Following *Lochner* (*Adkins* and *Morehead*)

* *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* (1923)
  * Struck down law setting minimum wage for women, holding that I interfered with freedom of contract without valid police powers objective
    * Court rejected the argument that without a minimum wage women would be forced to earn money in an immoral manner (e.g. prostitution)
    * It asserted that diminishing inequality has eliminated any such need for interference
* *Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo* (1936)
  * Once again, Court declared unconstitutional a state minimum wage law for women
  * Reaffirming *Adkins*, it found that the minimum wage law impermissibly interfered with freedom of contract because it did not serve a valid state police purpose

### *Meyer v. Nebraska* (1923)

* Facts - NE state law made it unlawful to teach foreign language to a child before passing 8th grade
* Issue - Whether the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringes the liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff in error by 14A
* Rule - **Cannot interfere with liberty under the guise of protecting public interest by legislative action which is arbitrary or lacking reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect**
* Outcome - Statute violates 14A DPC because there is fundamental right to teach children
* Majority (McReynolds)
  * Right of parents to control education of their own kids and right to teach
  * Legislature also interferes with calling of modern language teachers (a fundamental right)
  * Statute is arbitrary and without reasonable relation to an end within competency of State
    * No reasonable harm in teaching the German language. While easy to appreciate State's interest in fostering a homogeneous people with American ideals prepared readily to understand current discussions of civic matters, the means adopted, exceed the limitations upon the power of the state and conflict with rights assured to plaintiff in error
* Notes
  * Liberties identified thus far: (1) contract; (2) occupations; (3) acquiring useful knowledge; (4) marriage; (5) raise family; (6) worship God; (7) enjoy traditional common law privileges essential to happiness
  * Solidified the idea of substantive due process rights

## Modern Era

### *West Coast Hotel v. Parrish* (1937)

* Background: Case that formally brought *Lochner* era to an end; Court upheld state law requiring minimum wage for women and expressly overruled *Adkins* and *Morehead*
  * Test: law must be reasonably related to an interest in the community -> heightened scrutiny
  * Redistribution of wealth among economic classes not strictly prohibited

## Substantive Due Process Framework

* The differing conceptions of the tests for what unenumerated rights deserve heightened scrutiny in Griswold:
  * (1) Penumbral - Majority’s test: rights that are created by emanations from the penumbras of constitutional guarantees get strict scrutiny
  * (2) Traditions & Conscience - J. Goldberg concurrence: roughly equivalent to the rooted in history source; DPC protects rights "so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people to be ranked as fundamental."
  * (3) Implicit in Ordered Liberty - J. Harlan concurrence: "basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," completely independent of incorporation of the BoR
  * (4) None at All - J.J. Black and Stewart dissent: rejection of Lochner was a rejection of unenumerated fundamental rights. Court has no power of heightened scrutiny over infringements of unenumerated rights.
    * This can’t be it. That’s why Goldberg harps on the 9A, because its existence must mean that "No unenumerated rights" can’t be the answer

* To restate the scrutiny tests:
  * (1) **Strict Scrutiny -> Fundamental Rights: Unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest**
    * State has the burden of showing, and the interest must be the real interest for which the law is adopted, not just a conceivable interest
    * Under/over inclusiveness fails narrow tailoring, where it would not be a problem for rational basis
  * (2) **Rational Basis -> Non-fundamental Rights: Only unconstitutional if the restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate interest**
    * Can be any rational basis that the state might have had

### *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965)

* Facts - D, a health care provider, convicted as accessory (advising) under law prohibiting others using contraceptives. Law prohibits the use, but not distribution, of contraceptives. D challenges the constitutionality of the law
* Outcome - Law violates right to privacy implicit in Bill of Rights and incorporated by 14A DPC. Court takes a non-*Lochner* path to this conclusion
* Rules
  * The use of contraceptives in marital bedroom is a fundamental right; penumbral approach
  * Strict Scrutiny Test – Law unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling interest
* Majority (Douglas) - 14A DPC not the guide in this case (doesn’t want to fall into *Lochner* mess)
  * Right to privacy found in the penumbras of 1A, 3A, 4A and 5A + 9A (further rights), getting around the unenumerated issue
    * Penumbral approach to find right to privacy informed by Harlan dissent in *Poe v. Ullman*
  * Right to privacy includes the use of contraceptives by married couples (located within a "zone of privacy" implicit in guarantees of the bill of rights)
  * Connecticut law seeks to prohibit the use of contraceptives in the marital relationship and in doing so violates this area of protected freedoms
    * Decisional autonomy is an important liberty interest, as well as right to privacy
    * Cannot have laws sweeping unnecessarily broadly and invading area of protected freedom (resembles strict scrutiny test)
* Concurrence (Goldberg)
  * Fundamental rights not confined to those enumerated; look at rights rooted in traditions and conscious of our people -> 9A informs rights and points outside Bill of Rights
    * It is supported by numerous decisions of the Court, as well as specifically by the language and history of 9A. Additionally, right of privacy in marriage is rooted in the "traditions and collective conscience" of people and is therefore a fundamental right
    * 9A says "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people"
    * If the Court denies the existence of a marital right of privacy simply because it is not enumerated in the first eight amendments, it is essentially denying all meaning in the Ninth Amendment
  * Strict scrutiny applies here. State fails to show there is both compelling interest and means narrowly tailored. There were clearly less restrictive means available, thus it is unnecessarily broad
  * However, holding here should not be taken to mean that regulating sexual promiscuity or misconduct (fornication) automatically subject to strict scrutiny
* Concurrence (Harlan)
  * Test for fundamental rights is whether it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
  * Can use the 14A DPC directly to invalidate this state law
* Concurrence (White) - Scope of law too broad because infringes rights of married persons; no compelling reason
Dissent (Black) - There must be specific text in the Constitution to find a fundamental right
  * 9A does not create any new rights; DPC and 9A cannot be used to strike down state laws
* Dissent (Stewart) - DPC inapplicable because law not vague and doesn’t deny procedural due process
* Notes
  * Steps in application of strict scrutiny test
    * (1) Identify the interest (prevent illicit sexual relations)
    * (2) Is the interest compelling (not compelling here, but no reasoning provided)
    * (3) Law narrowly tailored (Court says the statute is too broad)
  * If fundamental right, apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, liberty interest gets rational basis
  * Observations/Comments on the Majority Opinion
    * Majority has some discussion of the protection of the home as one’s castle
    * Problem with the penumbras approach is almost anything can be found to be supported by penumbras of some of the bill of rights provisions
    * Describes privacy right in terms of the state-protected marital relationship. It is totally unclear coming out of Griswold how broad the right to privacy will end up being, or how "private" the act will need to be.

2) Strict scrutiny - applies the modern heightened scrutiny test: liberty infringement must be narrowly tailored (means) to achieve a compelling state interest (ends).
a. Note that what makes an interest "compelling" is w/o principle; court just says


So, Griswold says marriage relationship is w/in the protected zone of privacy, which is how it gets strict scrutiny. Douglas majority says that the state’s interest in avoiding extra-marital sexual behavior is compelling, but the law fails narrow tailoring because a complete ban on contraceptives is way over inclusive. Note that White’s concurrence doesn’t think there’s a compelling interest.

### *Bowers v. Hardwick* (1986)

* Facts: Georgia law criminalizes sodomy (oral or anal sex) as it applies to any person (not just homosexuals), even if consensual. Hardwick (R) was charged with violating the statute by committing that act with another adult male. R brought suit in Federal court challenging the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it criminalized consensual sodomy
* Issue: Whether the Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time
  * Implicit in answering this question is a call for some judgment about the limits of the Court's role in carrying out its constitutional mandate
* Holding: Court rules 5-4 in favor of upholding the statute as constitutional
* Majority (White)
  * Distinguished from cases involving reproductive rights such as *Griswold*, *Roe*, and *Casey*. Court thinks it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to claimed right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy; no connection between family, marriage, or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other
  * Two conceptions of the type of rights that warrant heightened judicial protection that the court has relied on:
    1. **Those fundamental liberties that are "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if sacrificed."**
    2. **Those liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."**
  * Neither of these formulations extend fundamental rights to include consensual sodomy
    * These acts have been condemned and forbidden throughout our nations entire history and long before then
  * Court also declines to adopt more expansive view and discover new fundamental rights
    * Concerns with "Lochnerism" - "Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution"
  * Rejects R's argument that this type of conduct should be protected when it occurs in the home
    * Plainly enough, otherwise illegal conduct is not always immunized whenever it occurs in the home
  * Since not a fundamental right, statue must satisfy rational basis which it does
    * Interest in banning acts that are believed immoral and unacceptable. If this were held to be an invalid interest, much of our nations laws would be vulnerable to being invalidated
* Concurrence (Burger)
  * Writes to emphasize view that there is no fundamental right to commit acts of sodomy. This been deeply maligned and regarded as heinous acts for thousands of years, a view firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian morals. Burger argues this can't simply be cast aside
* Dissent (Blackmun)
  * Right of sodomy isn't what is at issue here. This case is really about privacy and the right to be let alone for private consensual sex acts. **R's claim must be viewed in light of the values that underlie right to privacy** (framing issue?)
    * Court has long recognized constitutional privacy interest with reference to both decisions and places simultaneously (i.e.protecting the home)
    * These rights are protected because they form so central a part of an individual's life. "The concept of privacy embodies the 'moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole"
  * This ability independently to define one’s identity is central to concept of ordered liberty
    * The ability depends on "emotional enrichment from close ties with others" -> Sexual intimacy is "a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality
    * Thus Majority refuses to recognize fundamental interest at stake: that which an individual has in controlling intimate associations with others
  * Applying heightened scrutiny, the State's justifications for the statute not strong enough to warrant dismissing R's claim
    * No evidence that sodomy adversely affects public health and welfare. The fact that these things have simply been condemned for centuries is also insufficient
* Concurrence (Stevens) - Cannot have a law totally prohibiting sodomy given precedent protecting martial sex
  
### *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003)

* Facts: - Texas law makes it a crime for same sex individuals to engage in "deviate" sexual conduct (i.e. oral or anal sex). P's arrested for violating the statute. They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
* Issue: Whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
* Holding
* Majority (Kennedy)
  * Could have taken an alternative angle in challenging under the EPC (see *Romer*), but Court found it necessary to use this case to address *Bowers*. Stare decisis is not inexorable and *Bower* is re-worked through the stare decisis analysis defined in *Casey*. It ultimately holds *Bowers* was wrongly decided and overruled because:
    * Framing the issue around the fundamental right for homosexual sodomy demeans persons. Penalties and purposes of these statutes reach far beyond prohibiting certain sexual acts: they touch upon the most private of human conduct in the most private of places
    * Historical basis of the proscription is not valid because there are not many records of convictions for consensual acts performed in the privacy of one's home (i.e. any such convictions were instances of rape or predation). Likewise, virtually none of the laws in our nation's history were directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter
      * At the very least, these historical roots are overstated
    * Traditional considerations of ethics and morals does not answer to the issue of personal autonomy which is at stake here
      * Had this been considered, Majority in *Bowers* would have seen emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex
      * While this emergence has been more recent (over last half-century), it is clear that "history and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry." Additionally, other countries that share this tradition have since accepted this freedom sought by P's
  * Decision on substantive guarantee of liberty advances both EPC and DPC interests. Has been affirmed by court many times now
  * Our **Constitution protects liberty which is central to human dignity and autonomy - this gives individuals right to engage in their conduct without intervention from the government**; the state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making there private intimate conduct a crime
  * The Texas statute offers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual."
  * Could probably get rid of the word "legitimate" and get the same result here
  * Two-handed balancing between interest and private/personal life of individual
  * This isn’t really application of rational basis, as Scalia purports. The analysis is also very thin
* Concurrence (O'Connor, in judgement)
  * Does not want to overrule Bowers, but the Texas law should be struck down as unconstitutional via 14A EPC
* Dissent (Scalia)
  * Stare decisis should have lead to upholding of *Bowers*, as lower courts have relied on it in making decisions about other liberty interests. Also, no changing societal circumstances or legal developments exist that justify overturning it
    * Claims that majority's decision to do so is derived primarily from the widespread criticism of that decision
  * Majority's decision has almost no relevance to the instant case and leaves the central legal issue untouched
    * Nowhere does it declare that homosexual sodomy is a fundamental right, nor does it subject it to the appropriate level of scrutiny (strict)
    * It's subsequent application of the rational basis review would have far-reaching consequences. In failing rational basis, the court effectively holds that the state's interest in morality is not a sufficient interest to justify the law. This would mean every other law prohibiting a non-fundamental right, justified by the state's interest in preserving morality, could be invalidated
  * Right to privacy, as viewed by court at the time of *Bowers*, was reliant on doctrine of "substantive due process" (as suggested by the majority), but instead grounded in the penumbras of the constitution
