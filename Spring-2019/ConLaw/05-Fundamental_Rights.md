# Fundamental Rights Beyond Those Enumerated

* The differing conceptions of the tests for what unenumerated rights deserve heightened scrutiny in Griswold:
  * (1) Penumbral - Majority’s test: rights that are created by emanations from the penumbras of constitutional guarantees get strict scrutiny
  * (2) Traditions & Conscience - J. Goldberg concurrence: roughly equivalent to the rooted in history source; DPC protects rights “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people to be ranked as fundamental.”
  * (3) Implicit in Ordered Liberty - J. Harlan concurrence: “basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” completely independent of incorporation of the BoR
  * (4) None at All - J.J. Black and Stewart dissent: rejection of Lochner was a rejection of unenumerated fundamental rights. Court has no power of heightened scrutiny over infringements of unenumerated rights.
    * This can’t be it. That’s why Goldberg harps on the 9A, because its existence must mean that “No unenumerated rights” can’t be the answer

* To restate the scrutiny tests:
  * (1) **Strict Scrutiny -> Fundamental Rights: Unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest**
    * State has the burden of showing, and the interest must be the real interest for which the law is adopted, not just a conceivable interest
    * Under/over inclusiveness fails narrow tailoring, where it would not be a problem for rational basis
  * (2) **Rational Basis -> Non-fundamental Rights: Only unconstitutional if the restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate interest**
    * Can be any rational basis that the state might have had

### *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965)

* Facts - D, a health care provider, convicted as accessory (advising) under law prohibiting others using contraceptives. Law prohibits the use, but not distribution, of contraceptives. D challenges the constitutionality of the law
* Outcome - Law violates right to privacy implicit in Bill of Rights and incorporated by 14A DPC. Court takes a non-*Lochner* path to this conclusion
* Rules
  * The use of contraceptives in marital bedroom is a fundamental right; penumbral approach
  * Strict Scrutiny Test – Law unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling interest
* Majority (Douglas) - 14A DPC not the guide in this case (doesn’t want to fall into *Lochner* mess)
  * Right to privacy found in the penumbras of 1A, 3A, 4A and 5A + 9A (further rights), getting around the unenumerated issue
    * Penumbral approach to find right to privacy informed by Harlan dissent in *Poe v. Ullman*
  * Right to privacy includes the use of contraceptives by married couples (located within a “zone of privacy" implicit in guarantees of the bill of rights)
  * Connecticut law seeks to prohibit the use of contraceptives in the marital relationship and in doing so violates this area of protected freedoms
    * Decisional autonomy is an important liberty interest, as well as right to privacy
    * Cannot have laws sweeping unnecessarily broadly and invading area of protected freedom (resembles strict scrutiny test)
* Concurrence (Goldberg)
  * Fundamental rights not confined to those enumerated; look at rights rooted in traditions and conscious of our people -> 9A informs rights and points outside Bill of Rights
    * It is supported by numerous decisions of the Court, as well as specifically by the language and history of 9A. Additionally, right of privacy in marriage is rooted in the “traditions and collective conscience” of people and is therefore a fundamental right
    * 9A says "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people"
    * If the Court denies the existence of a marital right of privacy simply because it is not enumerated in the first eight amendments, it is essentially denying all meaning in the Ninth Amendment
  * Strict scrutiny applies here. State fails to show there is both compelling interest and means narrowly tailored. There were clearly less restrictive means available, thus it is unnecessarily broad
  * However, holding here should not be taken to mean that regulating sexual promiscuity or misconduct (fornication) automatically subject to strict scrutiny
* Concurrence (Harlan)
  * Test for fundamental rights is whether it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
  * Can use the 14A DPC directly to invalidate this state law
* Concurrence (White) - Scope of law too broad because infringes rights of married persons; no compelling reason
Dissent (Black) - There must be specific text in the Constitution to find a fundamental right
  * 9A does not create any new rights; DPC and 9A cannot be used to strike down state laws
* Dissent (Stewart) - DPC inapplicable because law not vague and doesn’t deny procedural due process
* Notes
  * Steps in application of strict scrutiny test
    * (1) Identify the interest (prevent illicit sexual relations)
    * (2) Is the interest compelling (not compelling here, but no reasoning provided)
    * (3) Law narrowly tailored (Court says the statute is too broad)
  * If fundamental right, apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, liberty interest gets rational basis
  * Observations/Comments on the Majority Opinion
    * Majority has some discussion of the protection of the home as one’s castle
    * Problem with the penumbras approach is almost anything can be found to be supported by penumbras of some of the bill of rights provisions
    * Describes privacy right in terms of the state-protected marital relationship. It is totally unclear coming out of Griswold how broad the right to privacy will end up being, or how “private” the act will need to be.


2) Strict scrutiny - applies the modern heightened scrutiny test: liberty infringement must be narrowly tailored (means) to achieve a compelling state interest (ends).
a. Note that what makes an interest “compelling” is w/o principle; court just says


So, Griswold says marriage relationship is w/in the protected zone of privacy, which is how it gets strict scrutiny. Douglas majority says that the state’s interest in avoiding extra-marital sexual behavior is compelling, but the law fails narrow tailoring because a complete ban on contraceptives is way over inclusive. Note that White’s concurrence doesn’t think there’s a compelling interest.
