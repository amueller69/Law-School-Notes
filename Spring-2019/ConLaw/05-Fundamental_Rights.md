# Fundamental Rights Beyond Those Enumerated

* **State Action Doctrine** – constitutional rights apply only to the governments and not to private entities and individuals
* Framers thought Bill of Rights was not necessary
  * Limited government powers via enumeration
  * List of rights would be dangerous because inevitably incomplete, though incorrectly viewed as exhaustive
* Selective incorporation – incorporate rights sufficiently fundamental to apply to states and local governments
  * (1) Must be in the Bill of Rights and (2) must be fundamental protection

| Type | Incorporated Rights | Unincorporated Rights |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Procedural | 4A, 5A, (double jeopardy; self-incrimination), 6A | 5A (grand jury indictment), 7A |
| Substantive | 1A, 2A, 8A | None, but 3A yet to be decided |

* **Procedural due process**, as the phrase implies, refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Classic procedural due process issues concern what kind of notice and what form of hearing the government must provide when it takes a particular action
  
* **Substantive due process** asks whether the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person's life, liberty, or property. In other words, substantive due process looks to whether there is a sufficient justification for the government's action. Whether there is such a justification depends very much on the level of scrutiny used
  * Existence of this has been contested, as some argue "process" denotes procedures and that it is incorrect to use the due process clause as the place for protecting substantive rights. Many argue 14A PIC is the appropriate place for safeguarding substantive rights (Narrow interpretation of PIC in *Slaughterhouse* has precluded this)
    * Critics argue that the Court acts illegitimately when it protects rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution or intended by its framers
    * The use of the doctrine to curb progressive era reforms has also drawn criticism which often fails to be separated from the doctrine itself
  * Defenders argue that it does not put substantive limits on government, but restraints on the executive/legislative powers. The clause does not speak solely of due process but, rather, "due process of law," and it is argued that an action is not in accord with the law of the land if it violates the substantive guarantees of the Constitution
    * The due process clause has been found to incorporate provisions of the Bill of Rights that are deemed fundamental and to protect these rights from state and local interference. This is substantive due process in that it uses the due process clause to protect rights and only allows interference if there is a sufficient justification

* It is possible to distinguish procedural and substantive due process based on the remedy sought. If the plaintiff is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional as violating a constitutional right, substantive due process is involved. But when a person or a group is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional because of the lack of adequate safeguards, such as notice and a hearing, procedural due process is the issue

## First 100 Years

* Three possible interpretations of the 14A PIC might cover:
  * (1) All fundamental rights -> Field and Bradley dissents; Historical and/or moral bases; P&I might cover rights that are fundamental but not explicitly enumerated.
  * (2) Incorporation of BoR (Amendments 1-8) -> Prenumbral view; PIC was meant/should be used to incorporate the enumerated bill of rights protections against the states
  * (3) Incidental national rights -> PI only encompasses rights that arise from the existence of a national government. The narrowest/most restrictive view and the one adopted by the *Slaughterhouse* majority

### *Slaughter House Cases* (1872)

* Facts: After breakout of disease caused by contamination of water supply by waste from a slaughterhouse located near the city, Louisiana passed law that granted a private company a 25-year monopoly in the livestock landing and slaughterhouse business. The law also required that the company allow any person to use the facilities to slaughter animals for a fixed fee. Several butchers brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the grant of a monopoly on the following basis:
  * It established involuntary servitude in violation of 13A
  * It violated the privileges or immunities clause
  * It violated the equal protection clauses of 14A
  * It denied their right to practice their trade and thus violated the due process clause
* Holding - The LA law is constitutional as a valid exercise of state police power
* Majority
  * Power exercised by state is an essential one: the **police power**. While incapable of being precisely defined, this power concerns the security of social order, the life and health of citizens, the beneficial use of property, and the enjoyment of private and social life
    * Authority of state of LA to pass law under this power is valid unless some restraint on the exercise on this power is found on the constitution
  * Not protected by 13A prohibitions against slavery, which was enacted for the purpose of forbidding any and all forms of African slavery. 14A EPC also only intended to protect freed slaves
  * **The PIC of 13A only protects the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the United States and not by the individual states**
    * State and national citizenship are distinct ("of the United States" vs. "of the several states")
    * Article 4 prohibits discrimination against out-of-state citizens with respect to P&Is, but all such individuals treated the same under the LA state law
    * Likewise, 14A PIC prohibits States from abridging the P&Is of citizens of the United States, meaning only those associated with national citizenship
  * Privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States are those which are fundamental; which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several States which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign
    * If the P&Is associated with National citizenship were expanded to included these same rights and thus subjecting the states to congressional control with respect to them, it would greatly disrupt the balance between state and federal governments
    * Thus these P&Is are left to the states to protect and secure and not placed in the special care of the federal government. This does not, however, mean that there exists no such P&Is belonging to national citizenship (e.g. access to seaports, rights while in jurisdiction of foreign government, etc.)
  * Finally, Court emphasized that DPC only concerned the procedures that government must follow and thus could not be used to challenge the law for interfering with the right of butchers to practice their trade
    * Thus, **Court flatly rejects the idea that the due process clause could be used to safeguard a right to practice a trade or profession from arbitrary government interference**
* Dissent (Fields)
  * Majority interpretation of 14A PIC render it a vain and idle enactment, meaningless and accomplishing nothing. It would be impossible for a state to interfere with these narrow category of National P&Is through its laws and there would be no reason to adopt a constitutional provision, thus 14A PIC must be something more
  * Interprets the words "liberty" and "property" in the due process clause of 14A as limiting the ability of states to adopt arbitrary laws that such interfere with one's calling, profession, or trade. This due process protection extends to any laws that interfered with natural rights

## *Lochner* Era

* *Lochner* era – protected rights not specifically provided in Constitution under DPC by means of some form of heightened scrutiny
  * Analyze ends served (permissible; i.e. – police powers) and also the means used (direct and substantial)
  * Unenumerated rights and protection via heightened scrutiny
  * Laissez fair jurisprudence – many laws unconstitutional for interfering w/ freedom to contract; others upheld
* Laws protecting unionizing; protection of maximum hours laws; no minimum wage laws for women; protected business entry; some consumer protection legislation upheld

### *Lochner v. New York* (1905)

* Facts - D violated state law prohibiting bakery employees from working 10+ hours per day or 60 hours per week
* Issue: Is this a fair, reasonable, and appropriate exercise of the police power of the state, or is it an unreasonable, unnecessary, and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty, or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and his family?
* Holding - Statute, restricts free bargaining between employers and employers over hours worked, unjustly interferes with right to freedom of contract protected by 14A DPC
* Rules:
  * **Liberty (right to purchase or to sell labor) and freedom to contract cannot be infringed unless the State directly and substantially serves a police power (health, safety, morals, or general welfare)**
  * Test 
* Majority (Peckham)
  * State has power to prevent individual from making certain kinds of contracts, but only those that it can prohibit in the legitimate exercise of its police power
  * Police powers must have limits to prevent use as a mere pretext; not a reasonable use here
    * The law was passed for ulterior motives of regulating hours of labor in private business. Lacked safety, moral, or health grounds
    * Baking not the type of employment/labor where it is reasonable to interfere, like it is with mining or smelting
    * Health reasons for law, as they apply to either Bakers or the general public, not direct or substantial enough
      * Connection between healthful quality of bread and hours worked is far too tenuous
      * Small amount of unhealthiness; police power would be too broad if we let this in
  * Can’t have economic redistribution where one class is favored over another; freedom of K
* Dissent (Holmes):
  * Test is whether a reasonable person would say statute infringes fundamental principle as they have been understood by traditions of our people and our law - should not function to prevent the exercise of a dominant opinion among states
    * Constitution gives States the power to make their own judgments about what laws are best for their individual citizens
    * Rejects the idea that Constitution should be used to protect a particular economic theory which largely unsupported by the popular will
* Dissent (Harlan) - Majority rule is okay, but law does protect the health of people because exposure to dust and illness
* Notes
  * The Court is applying heightened scrutiny to strike down state legislation. The test requires that the State regulation:
    1. **Serve a legitimate police power** (e.g. public health, safety, morals, welfare, etc.)
    1. The means of achieving this must have a **direct and substantial relationship** to the objective
  * Majority finds that the NY statute fails on the second prong. Limiting the hours of bakers does not promote public welfare or the welfare of bakers in any easily recognizable way. Instead, it limits autonomy to contract
  * **3 Key Themes that Persisted Through *Lochner* Era**:
    * (1) 14A DPC protects freedom to contract
    * (2) Government can only interfere with freedom of contract to serve valid police power
    * (3) Judicial role to carefully scrutinize legislation interfering with liberty
  * Was *Lochner* wrongly decided?
    * Unequal bargaining power may mean no real freedom to contract
      * However, even if directed at labor protections of bakers, could be viewed as protecting a particular class of individuals at the expense of another. Thus this would not be a permissible police powers objective since it doesn't have a net benefit to the public and merely redistributes
    * Inconsistent application of this doctrine leads to unpredictable and nonsensical results
    * Judiciary should not be invalidating laws adopted through democratic process; judicial values substituted (Excessive judicial activism by unelected judges)
    * Concerns over judicial heightened scrutiny and counter-majoritarian difficulty
    * Seems to have disregarded the "without due process" part of the 14A

### Cases Following *Lochner* (*Adkins* and *Morehead*)

* *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* (1923)
  * Struck down law setting minimum wage for women, holding that I interfered with freedom of contract without valid police powers objective
    * Court rejected the argument that without a minimum wage women would be forced to earn money in an immoral manner (e.g. prostitution)
    * It asserted that diminishing inequality has eliminated any such need for interference
* *Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo* (1936)
  * Once again, Court declared unconstitutional a state minimum wage law for women
  * Reaffirming *Adkins*, it found that the minimum wage law impermissibly interfered with freedom of contract because it did not serve a valid state police purpose

### *Meyer v. Nebraska* (1923)

* Facts - NE state law made it unlawful to teach foreign language to a child before passing 8th grade
* Issue - Whether the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringes the liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff in error by 14A
* Rule - **Cannot interfere with liberty under the guise of protecting public interest by legislative action which is arbitrary or lacking reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect**
* Outcome - Statute violates 14A DPC because there is fundamental right to teach children
* Majority (McReynolds)
  * Right of parents to control education of their own kids and right to teach
  * Legislature also interferes with calling of modern language teachers (a fundamental right)
  * Statute is arbitrary and without reasonable relation to an end within competency of State
    * No reasonable harm in teaching the German language. While easy to appreciate State's interest in fostering a homogeneous people with American ideals prepared readily to understand current discussions of civic matters, the means adopted, exceed the limitations upon the power of the state and conflict with rights assured to plaintiff in error
* Notes
  * Liberties identified thus far: (1) contract; (2) occupations; (3) acquiring useful knowledge; (4) marriage; (5) raise family; (6) worship God; (7) enjoy traditional common law privileges essential to happiness
  * Solidified the idea of substantive due process rights

### *West Coast Hotel v. Parrish* (1937)

* Background: Case that formally brought *Lochner* era to an end; Court upheld state law requiring minimum wage for women and expressly overruled *Adkins* and *Morehead*
* Holding
  * Test: **law/regulation must be reasonably related to an interest in the community -> heightened scrutiny**
  * Redistribution of wealth among economic classes not strictly prohibited
  * Court effectively declares that it no longer would protect freedom of contract as a fundamental right, that state government could regulate to serve any legitimate purpose, and that the judiciary would defer to the legislature's choices so long as they were reasonable
  > What is this freedom of contract? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law...Regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process
* *United States v. Carolene Products Co.* (1938) – confirms holding in *West Coast Hotel*; upholds Act barring filled milk using double standard of review
  * Economic regulations upheld so long as they are supported by conceivable rational basis
  * Defer to government and uphold the law if reasonable
  * Deference not extended to laws if (A) interferes with fundamental right on its face violates a Constitutional provision, (B) restricts political process, or (C) discriminates against discrete and insular minorities

## Modern Era

* To restate the scrutiny tests:
  * (1) **Strict Scrutiny -> Fundamental Rights: Unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest**
    * State has the burden of showing, and the interest must be the real interest for which the law is adopted, not just a conceivable interest
    * Under/over inclusiveness fails narrow tailoring, where it would not be a problem for rational basis
  * (2) **Rational Basis -> Non-fundamental Rights: Only unconstitutional if the restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate interest**
    * Can be any rational basis that the state might have had

* The differing conceptions of the tests for what unenumerated rights are "fundamental" and deserve heightened scrutiny in *Griswold*:
  * (1) Penumbral - Majority’s test: Rights that found in the the penumbras of Bill of Rights guarantees, which are formed by emanations which give those guarantees life and substance, are fundamental -> strict scrutiny
  * (2) Traditions & Conscience - J. Goldberg concurrence: roughly equivalent to the "rooted in history" approach; DPC protects rights "so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people to be ranked as fundamental."
  * (3) Implicit in Ordered Liberty - J. Harlan concurrence: "basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," completely independent of incorporation of the BoR
  * (4) None at All - J.J. Black and Stewart dissent: rejection of Lochner was a rejection of unenumerated fundamental rights. Court has no power of heightened scrutiny over infringements of unenumerated rights.
    * This can’t be what the framers intended. As Goldberg points out, this would directly conflict with 9A, which holds that the enumeration of rights should not be viewed as exhaustive or used to disparage those retained by the people. This in itself evidence of the framers intent belief in fundamental unenumerated rights
* There is also that expressed by Harlan in *Ullman*: Neither the B.o.R. or 14A mark the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty. It is a rational continuum which broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial and arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints

* Abortion
  * Potential approaches to overturning *Roe*
    * (1) Right to abortion is not "fundamental" or a protected liberty interest
    * (2) Fetus is a life in the morally relevant sense from conception
    * (3) Fetus is a person within the meaning of the DPC; every state would have to prohibit abortion
    * (4) No trimester framework (more of a revision than an overruling)
  * *Roe* trimester framework replaced with the undue burden test in *Casey*
  * Post-*Roe* Abortion Jurisprudence
    * *Danforth* (1976) – invalidated law requiring spousal consent, + for < 18 parental consent, prior to abortion
    * *Akron I* (1983) – reaffirmed right to choose abortion; invalidated the following regulations:
      * 24 hour waiting period after written consent; detailed info guidelines for informed consent
    * Maher v. *Roe* (1977) – upheld law limiting Medicaid benefits non-medically necessary abortions
      * *Roe* was not an unqualified right to an abortion, but a right to freedom of choice
    * *Harris v. McRae* (1980) – upheld law limiting fed. Medicaid funds to abortions necessary to save mother
    * *Webster v. Reproductive Health Services* (1989) – Kennedy stated that he would overrule *Roe*
      * Upheld MO law: banned use of public facilities for abortions and required extensive viability tests

### *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965)

* Facts - D, a health care provider, convicted as accessory (advising) under law prohibiting others using contraceptives. Law prohibits the use, but not distribution, of contraceptives. D challenges the constitutionality of the law
* Outcome - Law violates right to privacy implicit in Bill of Rights and incorporated by 14A DPC. Court takes a non-*Lochner* path to this conclusion
* Rules
  * The use of contraceptives in marital bedroom is a fundamental right; penumbral approach
  * Strict Scrutiny Test – Law unconstitutional unless restriction on liberty is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling interest
* Majority (Douglas) - 14A DPC not the guide in this case (doesn’t want to fall into *Lochner* mess)
  * Right to privacy found in the penumbras of 1A, 3A, 4A and 5A + 9A (further rights), getting around the unenumerated issue
    * Penumbral approach to find right to privacy informed by Harlan dissent in *Poe v. Ullman*
    * The animating principles behind the Bill of Rights are broader than what is explicitly enumerated; they give rise to other rights whose existence can be viewed as implicit
  * Right to privacy includes the use of contraceptives by married couples (located within a "zone of privacy" implicit in guarantees of the bill of rights)
  * Connecticut law seeks to prohibit the use of contraceptives in the marital relationship and in doing so violates this area of protected freedoms
    * Decisional autonomy is an important liberty interest, as well as right to privacy
    * Cannot have laws sweeping unnecessarily broadly and invading area of protected freedom (resembles strict scrutiny test)
* Concurrence (Goldberg)
  * Fundamental rights not confined to those enumerated; look at rights rooted in traditions and conscious of our people -> 9A informs rights and points outside Bill of Rights (not simply confined to first 8 amendments)
    * Instead, it emanates from the underlying principles and purposes of the entire constitutional fabric (fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions)
    * It is supported by numerous decisions of the Court, as well as specifically by the language and history of 9A. Additionally, right of privacy in marriage is rooted in the "traditions and collective conscience" of people and is therefore a fundamental right
    * 9A says "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people"
    * If the Court denies the existence of a marital right of privacy simply because it is not enumerated in the first eight amendments, it is essentially denying all meaning in the Ninth Amendment
  * Strict scrutiny applies here. State fails to show there is both compelling interest and means narrowly tailored. There were clearly less restrictive means available, thus it is unnecessarily broad
  * However, holding here should not be taken to mean that regulating sexual promiscuity or misconduct (fornication) automatically subject to strict scrutiny
* Concurrence (Harlan)
  * Test for fundamental rights is whether it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
  * Can use the 14A DPC directly to invalidate this state law
* Concurrence (White) - Scope of law too broad because infringes rights of married persons; no compelling reason
* Dissent (Black) - There must be specific text in the Constitution to find a fundamental right
  * 9A does not create any new rights; DPC and 9A cannot be used to strike down state laws
* Dissent (Stewart) - DPC inapplicable because law not vague and doesn’t deny procedural due process
  
* Notes
  * Steps in application of strict scrutiny test
    * (1) Identify the interest (prevent illicit sexual relations)
    * (2) Is the interest compelling (not compelling here, but no reasoning provided)
    * (3) Law narrowly tailored (Court says the statute is too broad)
  * If fundamental right, apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, liberty interest gets rational basis
  * Observations/Comments on the Majority Opinion
    * Majority has some discussion of the protection of the home as one’s castle
    * Problem with the penumbras approach is almost anything can be found to be supported by penumbras of some of the bill of rights provisions
    * Describes privacy right in terms of the state-protected marital relationship. It is totally unclear coming out of Griswold how broad the right to privacy will end up being, or how "private" the act will need to be.

### *Roe v. Wade* (SCOTUS 1973)

* Facts: TX law makes it a crime to procure an abortion except to save the mother’s life. Roe challenges this as a violation of 14A due process, arguing that the right to chose is embodied in personal/familial/sexual privacy found either in the penumbras of th B.o.R. or among those reserved to the people by 9A
* Outcome: Statute is unconstitutional because it is too broad and doesn’t distinguish at compelling points
* Rule: Fundamental constitutional right to procure an abortion founded in right to privacy
* Majority - (Blackmun):
  * Historically, there were broad termination rights; only justifications for curbing those have been interests in: preventing illicit sexual conduct; concern for mothers health; and protecting prenatal life (Court says this is the only compelling one)
  * Right to privacy, whether it come from 14A, 9A, or B.o.R. is broad enough to encompass woman’s right to terminate
    * Not all privacy rights get strict scrutiny. Rather, only those privacy rights that are also able to be "deemed fundamental" or "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" get heightened scrutiny
  * Right (privacy) is not absolute; some regulations is justified under the circumstances. **Must be balanced against state interests**
  * Applies heightened scrutiny: **Must be justified by a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests**
    * Steps: Identify interest, ask if compelling, determine if narrowly tailored
  * State has important and legitimate interests in protecting the health of the mother and protect potential for life -> grows more compelling as woman approaches term
    * Compelling points are at end of 1st trimester when mother’s health is at greater risk and at end of 2nd trimester (point of viability) where there is potential for human life
    * At first trimester, can regulate to the extent it reasonably relates to maternal health (e.g. heightened licensing requirements on who can perform procedures)
    * At point of viability, state with interest in protecting fetal life can prohibit abortions except when necessary to protect health of mother
  * Here, statute makes no such distinctions and sweeps to broadly - cannot survive constitutional challenge
* Concurrence – (Stewart): Liberty protected by 14A includes personal choice in matters of marriage and family life
  * Compelling state interests do not meet broad statutory language, so unconstitutional
* Concurrence – (Douglas): Wants to stick with BoR penumbras. Zones of privacy include autonomous control over self, freedom of choice in life decisions, and freedom from bodily restraint or compulsion
* Dissent – (White): Judiciary imposing views of life existence on people; should leave to political process
* Dissent – (Rehnquist): Liberty not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against such without due process
  * Adopts the "so rooted in traditions and conscience" formulation - only those rooted in longstanding historical traditions should be considered fundamental
  * Test should be whether the law has a rational relation to a valid state objective; not a fundamental right
    * No rational basis if not protecting when the mother’s health is in danger
  * Decision here is similar to that in Lochner where court passes value judgments on laws
* Notes: Texas said fetus is a living person for purposes of strict scrutiny; majority says they can’t really believe this b/c they don’t call it murder when killing to protect the mother’s health
  * Standing because mootness overcome when issue capable of repetition yet evading review
  * Majority applies strict scrutiny which produces the trimester framework
  * Not everything in privacy bubble is fundamental right; only those things that are also implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Perhaps privacy is not doing any work here

### *Casey v. Planned Parenthood of S.E. PA* (1992)

* Facts - PA statute requires informed consent 24 hrs prior to abortion, requires minors to get consent from parent (judicial bypass in some cases), married woman must notify spouse, exceptions for medical emergencies
* Outcome - Reaffirmed Roe; all provisions constitutional except spousal provision
* Rule - Undue burden if purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability; no more trimester framework
* Joint Opinion (Kennedy, O’Connor, Souter) - Roe: recognize woman’s right to choose prior to point of viability, confirm state power to restrict after viability, and recognize state legitimate interests in woman’s health and life
  * "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life." -> freedom to make personal choices
  * "Stare decisis is not an inexorable command". It can be overruled, especially in constitutional cases (these can't be corrected by congress)
  * Stare Decisis Test
    * (1) Intolerable rule because it defies practical workability (not the case here)
    * (2) Rule subject to the kind of reliance lending special hardship as a consequence of overruling and adding inequity to the cost of repudiation (has shaped a generation's expectations w.r.t. reproductive decisions)
    * (3) Related principles so far developed as to have left old rule as a remnant of abandoned doctrine (liberty and personal autonomy arguments still strong)
    * (4) Facts have changed or are now seen so different that old rule robbed of significant application or justification (not here)
  * Tests reveals that underpinnings of *Roe* have not been weakened in any way. Cannot overrule Roe because it would run counter to precedent and would weaken legitimacy and good faith of public by giving in to public pressures
  * Keeps point of viability as the point where the line is drawn, but abandons trimester framework in favor of the undue burden test
    * Viability is kept because of both stare decisis and the fact that it represents the point in which protecting the existence of independent life can override the rights of the mother
    * Trimester framework is nonessential to holding in *Roe* and rejected. State can have interest in protecting the unborn. The rigid prohibition of interference prior to viability goes too far and misconceives state's potential interest in potential life; ensuring that woman is making an informed and thoughtful choice does not offend constitution at this stage
    * **The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does is it violate DP**
    * A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation **has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle** in the path of a woman seeking an abortion (this is not a permissible means of serving a legitimate end). Thus, the means for furthering the interest at hand must be calculated to inform woman's free choice, not hinder it (if no substantial obstacle, then pro-life regulation is fine)
      * Waiting period is not undue burden. Burdensome does not necessarily mean it is undue or create a substantial obsticle
      * Spousal consent is, however, is an undue burden because may lead to child abuse, psychological harm, etc.
* Concurrence/Dissent (Stevens) - Don’t get rid of trimester framework; undue burden if too severe or lacking legit. justifier
  * 24 hour informed consent mandate should be unconstitutional because its coercive
* Dissent – (Blackmun): Right to terminate protected in early stages; subject all restrictions to strictest scrutiny
  * A single vote separates two very different worlds; fears future overturning of Roe
* Dissent - (Rehnquist): Roe wrongly decided and should be overruled; PA statute entirely constitutional
  * No strict scrutiny for abortion legislation; apply rational basis test b/c no fundament. right
* Dissent – Scalia - Test: whether text expressly provides right or longstanding tradition in society
  * Wants a sharp line rule instead of a standard
    * What's the difference: standard calls for a certain amount of evaluative judgement in its application while a rule doesn't rely on such
  * Apply rational basis test and uphold the statute in its entirety; no fundamental right here
  * Cannot overrule trimester framework, but reaffirm Roe, because that is central to holding
* Notes -
  * Stare decisis is given less weight in constitutional cases given tough amendment process
  * Majority never calls abortion a "fundamental" liberty; related to autonomy, personhood
  * Undue burden standard prior to viability, but rational basis applies post-viability

### *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997)

* Facts - WA law makes person guilty for knowingly causing or aiding another to attempt suicide. Voters in WA rejected ballot referendum that would have effectively permitted physician assisted suicide (P.A.S.) and shortly thereafter, this was expressly excluded from Natural Death Act which made it so withholding life-sustaining treatment would not constitute suicide. Phsyicians who occasionally treat terminally ill patients brought suit in federal court seeking declaration that the law is, **on its face**, unconstitutional
* Holding - No fundamental liberty interest protected by DPC for physician assisted suicide; WA state law is upheld
* Rule - Substantive due process analysis – conjunctive test to find fundamental right
  * Two primary features of substantive due process analysis
    * **(1) It specially protects fundamental rights/liberties which deeply rooted in Nation’s history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty**
    * **(2) A careful and narrow description of asserted liberty interest at stake is required**
* Majority (Rehnquist) -
  * Long tradition (700+ years) of disapproving and punishing suicide and assisted suicide. This is longstanding expression of State's commitment to the protection and preservation of human life
    * Attitudes haven't real changes with respect to this issue and it continues to be strongly condemned
  * Applies due process analysis defined above, reasoning that only recognizing those rights deeply rooted in legal tradition it reins in subjective elements
  * Concludes that not rooted in tradition which "consistently and universally" rejects the asserted right and thus not fundamental liberty interest protected by DPC
    * P's rely on both *Cruzan* and *Casey*
      * Reliance on *Cruzan* is misguided – it dealt with the right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition based on informed consent, something entirely distinct from the decision to commit suicide with the assistance of another (the former also having roots in the common law right to refuse forced medication)
      * As it pertains to *Casey* – Holding that rights and liberties protected by DPC sound in personal autonomy does not warrant a sweeping conclusion that all are so protected
  * Since not fundamental, it applies rational basis test. **State's ban must only be rationally related to some legitimate government interest, which the court concludes it is**
    * State interests: Preservation of human life; Protecting integrity and ethics of medical profession; Public health problem with mentally ill and depressed patients changing minds; Protection of vulnerable grounds (elderly, poor, disabled) from coercion or abuse; Slippery slope to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia
      * Court finds no need to get into specifics as theses are unquestionably important and legitimate
  * Ban on P.A.S is at the very least reasonably related to these legitimate interests
* Concurrence (O’Connor) - Terminal sedation
  * Can give sufficient medication if patient is in extreme pain, even if the amount to be given would kill the patient -> right to be free from extraordinary pain
    * Key factor – amount of pain and suffering. Those not facing imminent death or unbearable suffering don't have rights sufficient to outweighs state's interest in protecting and preserving life
* Concurrence (Stevens)
  * Though ban is not invalid on it's face, there are still applications where the circumstances would render it invalid
  * Key factor should be whether terminal or not; deciding how to die versus when to die
* Concurrence (Souter)
  * Test = whether statute sets up one an arbitrary imposition or purposeless restraint at odds with 14A DPC (citing Harlan in *Poe*); look at arbitrariness and evolving legal tradition
  * Harlan dissent in Poe – judicial obligation to give detailed look at reasonableness
  * Slippery slope issue is important, which looks at voluntary versus involuntary distinction
  * Key factor – dignity; doing the action on your own vs. someone else doing it
* Notes - Note that if you do not think the right is tethered to history, get a range of opinions
  * As-applied holding for competent, terminally ill adults hastening death
  * All justices would allow the withdrawal of life support (Cruzan)
  * The patient must be terminally ill for justices to look at as-applied challenge here (none of the opinions would support P.A.S. where patient is not facing inevitable death)
  * Canadian Approach (from *Carter v. Canada*)
    * Canadian approach is similar to the European one; Increased emphasis on dignity and autonomy
      * **Two-handed balancing test**: Proportionality review in which the law must have hard pressing and substantial objective and the means chosen are proportional to that objective
        * Law is proportionate if means adopted are rationally connected to the objective, minimally impairing of the rights in question, and the deleterious and salutary effects of the law are proportional
    * This can be contrasted with the more rigid and "one-handed" American approach in which the right at issue determines the level of judicial scrutiny, but only the governmental interest and its germaneness to the means are considered once operating inside this tier of scrutiny

### *Bowers v. Hardwick* (1986)

* Facts: Georgia law criminalizes sodomy (oral or anal sex) as it applies to any person (not just homosexuals), even if consensual. Hardwick (R) was charged with violating the statute by committing that act with another adult male. R brought suit in Federal court challenging the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it criminalized consensual sodomy
* Issue: Whether the Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time
  * Implicit in answering this question is a call for some judgment about the limits of the Court's role in carrying out its constitutional mandate
* Holding: Court rules 5-4 in favor of upholding the statute as constitutional
* Majority (White)
  * Distinguished from cases involving reproductive rights such as *Griswold*, **Roe**, and *Casey*. Court thinks it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to claimed right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy; no connection between family, marriage, or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other
  * Two conceptions of the type of rights that warrant heightened judicial protection that the court has relied on:
    1. **Those fundamental liberties that are "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if sacrificed."**
    2. **Those liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."**
  * Neither of these formulations extend fundamental rights to include consensual sodomy
    * These acts have been condemned and forbidden throughout our nations entire history and long before then
  * Court also declines to adopt more expansive view and discover new fundamental rights
    * Concerns with "Lochnerism" - "Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution"
  * Rejects R's argument that this type of conduct should be protected when it occurs in the home
    * Plainly enough, otherwise illegal conduct is not always immunized whenever it occurs in the home
  * Since not a fundamental right, statue must satisfy rational basis which it does
    * Interest in banning acts that are believed immoral and unacceptable. If this were held to be an invalid interest, much of our nations laws would be vulnerable to being invalidated
* Concurrence (Burger)
  * Writes to emphasize view that there is no fundamental right to commit acts of sodomy. This been deeply maligned and regarded as heinous acts for thousands of years, a view firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian morals. Burger argues this can't simply be cast aside
* Dissent (Blackmun)
  * Right of sodomy isn't what is at issue here. This case is really about privacy and the right to be let alone for private consensual sex acts. **R's claim must be viewed in light of the values that underlie right to privacy** (framing issue?)
    * Court has long recognized constitutional privacy interest with reference to both decisions and places simultaneously (i.e.protecting the home)
    * These rights are protected because they form so central a part of an individual's life. "The concept of privacy embodies the 'moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole"
  * This ability independently to define one’s identity is central to concept of ordered liberty
    * The ability depends on "emotional enrichment from close ties with others" -> Sexual intimacy is "a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality
    * Thus Majority refuses to recognize fundamental interest at stake: that which an individual has in controlling intimate associations with others
  * Applying heightened scrutiny, the State's justifications for the statute not strong enough to warrant dismissing R's claim
    * No evidence that sodomy adversely affects public health and welfare. The fact that these things have simply been condemned for centuries is also insufficient
* Concurrence (Stevens) - Cannot have a law totally prohibiting sodomy given precedent protecting martial sex
  
### *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003)

* Facts: - Texas law makes it a crime for same sex individuals to engage in "deviate" sexual conduct (i.e. oral or anal sex). P's arrested for violating the statute. They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
* Issue: Whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
* Holding
* Majority (Kennedy)
  * Could have taken an alternative angle in challenging under the EPC (see *Romer*), but Court found it necessary to use this case to address *Bowers*. Stare decisis is not inexorable and *Bower* is re-worked through the stare decisis analysis defined in *Casey*. It ultimately holds *Bowers* was wrongly decided and overruled because:
    * Framing the issue around the fundamental right for homosexual sodomy demeans persons. Penalties and purposes of these statutes reach far beyond prohibiting certain sexual acts: they touch upon the most private of human conduct in the most private of places
    * Historical basis of the proscription is not valid because there are not many records of convictions for consensual acts performed in the privacy of one's home (i.e. any such convictions were instances of rape or predation). Likewise, virtually none of the laws in our nation's history were directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter
      * At the very least, these historical roots are overstated
    * Traditional considerations of ethics and morals does not answer to the issue of personal autonomy which is at stake here
      * Had this been considered, Majority in *Bowers* would have seen emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex
      * While this emergence has been more recent (over last half-century), it is clear that "history and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry." Additionally, other countries that share this tradition have since accepted this freedom sought by P's
  * Decision on substantive guarantee of liberty advances both EPC and DPC interests. Has been affirmed by court many times now
  * Our **Constitution protects liberty which is central to human dignity and autonomy - this gives individuals right to engage in their conduct without intervention from the government**; the state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making there private intimate conduct a crime
  * The Texas statute offers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual."
  * Could probably get rid of the word "legitimate" and get the same result here
  * Two-handed balancing between interest and private/personal life of individual
  * This isn’t really application of rational basis, as Scalia purports. The analysis is also very thin
* Concurrence (O'Connor, in judgement)
  * Does not want to overrule Bowers, but the Texas law should be struck down as unconstitutional via 14A EPC
* Dissent (Scalia)
  * Stare decisis should have lead to upholding of *Bowers*, as lower courts have relied on it in making decisions about other liberty interests. Also, no changing societal circumstances or legal developments exist that justify overturning it
    * Claims that majority's decision to do so is derived primarily from the widespread criticism of that decision
  * Majority's decision has almost no relevance to the instant case and leaves the central legal issue untouched
    * Nowhere does it declare that homosexual sodomy is a fundamental right, nor does it subject it to the appropriate level of scrutiny (strict)
    * It's subsequent application of the rational basis review would have far-reaching consequences. In failing rational basis, the court effectively holds that the state's interest in morality is not a sufficient interest to justify the law. This would mean every other law prohibiting a non-fundamental right, justified by the state's interest in preserving morality, could be invalidated
  * Right to privacy, as viewed by court at the time of *Bowers*, was reliant on doctrine of "substantive due process" (as suggested by the majority), but instead grounded in the penumbras of the constitution

### *Loving v. Virginia* (1967)

* Facts: Inter-racial couple challenge constitutionality of Virginia statute that prohibits and criminalizes inter-racial marriage and eloping with the purpose of cohabiting as married couple after returning to Virginia. It also voids all such marriages automatically without a judicial proceeding. The definition of inter-racial marriage in the statute only extended to that between a white person and a colored person. State contends that there is no EPC violation since applies to both races equally
* Holding: VA state statute ruled unconstitutional as violation of 14A
* Majority (Warren):
  * Court rejects the notion that the mere "equal application" of a statute containing racial classification is sufficient to remove it from 14A's prohibition of invidious racial discriminations, nor does it immunize it from the heavy burden of justification required by 14A of statutes drawn according to race
  * EPC requires the consideration of whether the classifications drawn by any statute constitute an arbitrary and invidious discrimination. The clear and central purpose of 14A was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States. This, at the very least, is grounds for treating the classification as highly suspect and subjecting it to the strictest form of judicial scrutiny
    * No question but this miscegenation statute rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race
    * There is patently **no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification**. Clearly a measure designed to maintain white supremacy
  * Court also holds this deprives P's of liberty in violation of 14A DPC, as the freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men
    * **To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis** as racial classifications, directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of 14A, **surely deprives citizens of liberty without due process** of law

### *Zablocki v. Redhail* (1978)

* Facts: Wisconsin statute prevented members of a certain class of residents from marrying without first obtaining a court order granting them permission to marry. This class was defined by the statute to include any Wisconsin resident required by court order or judgment to pay child support to a minor that was not in his custody. P fathered a child as a high schooler and was ordered to pay monthly child support until the girl reached age eighteen. D was unemployed and indigent and was unable to make any child support payments. As a result, he was subsequently denied an application for a marriage license under tha statute. D brought suit against state official in federal district court on the grounds that the statute violated the EPC of 14A
* Majority (Marshall)
  * Precedent of the Court has treated right to marry as fundamental, long recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men
    * More recent decisions have established that the right to marry is part of the fundamental “right of privacy” implicit in the 14A DPC. Court in *Griswold* and after have routinely categorized the decision to marry as among the personal decisions protected by the right of privacy
      * > While the outer limits of [the right of personal privacy] have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions ‘relating to marriage - *Loving v. Virginia*
  * Although this right is fundamental, reasonable regulations that do not significantly interfere with decisions to enter into the marital relationship may legitimately be imposed
    * However, **the statutory classification at issue here, however, clearly does interfere directly and substantially with the right to marry**. Notwithstanding serious concerns about the effect on those without the financial means to escape the classification, those who can be persuaded to meet the statute’s requirements suffer a serious intrusion into their freedom of choice in an area in which we have held such freedom to be fundamental
  * Court applies some variant of EPC heightened scrutiny, requiring the a classification interfering with a fundamental right be **supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests**
    * While the interests in protecting the welfare of the out-of-custody child and counseling the applicant of his support obligations are legitimate and substantial, **the means selected by the State for achieving these interests unnecessarily impinge on the right to marry**
    * Less discriminatory means exist by which the Court may compel delinquent persons to fulfill child support obligations, thus the means in the statute are excessively broad and thus render it a violation of **equal protection** under 14A (not substantive due process - this is of significant importance)
* Concurrence (Stewart)
  * Majority improperly determines that the statute violates the EPC. The application of the EPC is improper because it deals with the prevention of invidious discrimination and not the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, which
  * Application of the DPC is proper here. Since the law particularly burdens the liberty interests of the indigent, as it completely eliminates their ability to marry for financial reasons
    * The statute is thus unconstitutional as a violation of substantive due process under 14A
* Dissent (Rehnquist)
  * Marriage is not a “fundamental right” triggering the application of strict scrutiny. Rational basis review should be applied
  * Under rational basis review, the statute is a permissible exercise of a state’s power to regulate family life and to assure the support of minor children
* Notes:
  * What's happening in the majority opinion is the introduction of the "fundamental rights" branch of equal protection scrutiny
    * This adds an additional element to the EPC analysis: even where not based on a suspect classification, the thing involved with respect to the classification scheme is deemed so important as to require some form of heightened scrutiny

### *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015)

* Facts: In response to some states legalizing same-sex marriage, various states enacted laws and constitutional amendments defining marriage as between one man and one woman. Multiple same-sex couples in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, and Michigan brought suit against officials responsible for enforcing the laws in that state claiming they violate 14A by denying them right to marry or to recognize marriages performed out of state
* Majority Opinion (Kennedy):
  * Right to marry is a fundamental right as held by the Court on multiple occasions
    * Fundamental liberties not limited to those enumerated in B.o.R. or 14A - **these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs**
    * Identifying fundamental rights has not been reduced to any formula - it requires court exercise reasoned judgement in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord them respect (standard, not a rule). This determination is guided by the broad principles set forth in other constitutional provisions, along with history and tradition (though these two do not set outer limits)
    * Those who ratified 14A and B.o.R. entrusted future generations to protect liberty as we learn its meaning; when new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and perceived legal structures, the claim to liberty must be addressed
    * Applying these tenets, Court has long held marriage to be protected as fundamental, calling it one of the "vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men". Essential attributes of this right are based in history, tradition, and other constitutional guarantees. 4 principles support this:
      * (1) Right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy, similar to choices regarding procreation and family relationships
      * (2) It supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals - right to enjoyment of intimate association
      * (3) It safeguards families and children, thus draws meaning from related rights of childbearing, procreation, and education
      * (4) Nation's traditions make it clear that marriage is keystone of our social order. Mutual recognition of support between the couple and society; also a basis for an expanding list of governmental rights, benefits, and obligations
        * No difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples with regard to this principle, yet sex couples are excluded from this institution and its corresponding benefits, much to their detriment
        * **It demeans gays for the state to lock them out of the most central institution of the Nation's society. This inconsistency with the fundamental right to marry is now obvious**
  * Case history is instructive that the inquiry should be directed towards the right to marry in the comprehensive sense, asking if there was justification from excluding right from a particular class, rather than an inquiry into whether there exists a fundamental right with reference to that class
  * Right of same-sex couples to mary also derives from 14A EPC - there is interrelation between EPC and DPC and lead to a stronger understanding of each other. Reasons why marriage is a fundamental right becomes more clear and compelling from full awareness of the hurt that has resulted from unequal application
    * These considerations lead Court to the conclusion that **the right to mary is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person and under both the DPC and EPC of 14A, same sex couples cannot be deprived of that right**
  * While democracy is appropriate process for change, this is only the case insofar as that process does no abridge fundamental rights. Where rights of person are violated, Constitution requires redress by the courts notwithstanding values of democratic decision making
* Dissent (Roberts): There only exists a right to traditional marriage
  * Right to marriage is only fundamental insofar as it refers to monogamous, heterosexual marriage. This right is subject to heightened scrutiny
  * No such fundamental right to a definition of marriage that extends to whatever we want it to
  * There is no 'Nobility and Dignity' Clause in the Constitution, and thus the majority position has no basis in principle or tradition (this seems to be of clear constitutional significance, to deny this seems disingenuous)
* Dissent (Thomas): There is no right to legally recognized marriage
  * Marriage is effectively a conditional offer for a government entitlement. State will recognize marriage and provide benefits associate with marriage under the condition that it conform to the traditional definition of marriage (i.e. 1 man, 1 woman)
  * Idea of substantive due process is a distortion of the constitution. It only guarantees whatever "process" is "due" before a person is deprived of life, liberty, and property (i.e. procedural due process). SDP invites judiciary to substitute their personal views as a guide for constitutional interpretation (charges of Lochnerism)
  * There is no negative liberty interest (individual freedom from governmental action) at stake here, and this is the only type protected by the DPC. This is merely the conditioning or selective denial of government entitlements. Petitioners have not been deprived
    * This is different than *Loving* and *Zablocki*, as there where negative liberty interests involved in the form of absolute prohibitions on private actions associated with marriage
    * Critique of this dissent - Thomas dismisses the "dignity" argument by arguing the government does not bestow dignity on individuals but it is in fact innate, thus they are not being deprived of dignity when excluded from some entitlement. However, the issue is whether denial of the benefit of legally recognized marriage offends constitutional principles by **failing to respect** the dignity of gays. Thomas clearly recognizes the constitutional significance of this type of injury when the issue of race is at stake (see *Bollinger*)
  
* Notes on *Obergefell*:
  * 3 possible approaches to challenging the constitutionality of the state laws here: EPC, DPC, and EPC with fundamental rights branch
    * Pure EPC - Must do three things to be successful: (1) Get intermediate scrutiny for classifications discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation; (2) Get the state laws viewed as discrimination on basis of sexual orientation; (3) Show that this fails intermediate scrutiny
      * (1) likely poses the greatest challenge. While "inequal" in commonsense ways, it is not obvious that they strongly implicate inequality with respect to “protection” of the laws. In *Romer*, this was only entitled to rational basis review. Likewise, this doesn't seem to fit the definition of a "discrete and insular minority" - there is no hostility or unwillingness to cooperate with that frustrates the ability of LGBT people to remedy their situation through the political process (this category seems to be reserved exclusively for race)
    * Substantive Due Process under 14A - Must show that this is a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
      * Possible rebuttal - This must be objectively, deeply rooted in history and tradition, per *Gluckbsburg*. The right of same-sex marriage is not supported by the historical traditions and practices of our country. However, in *Lawrence*, court exclaimed that history and tradition may guide the fundamental rights inquiry, but it doesn't create outer limits
      * Also the framing/scoping issue. How narrowly circumscribed must the right at issue be viewed? *Glucksberg* would suggest the inquiry relate specifically to the right of same-sex marriage (i.e. "careful description") whereas *Loving* and *Zablocki* seem to inquire about the right to mary in its comprehensive sense. *Lawrence* Court also accused the Court in *Bowers* of framing the issue too narrowly
    * Some hybrid combination of the two, which appears to be the one that the majority adopts
      * Marriage is both 'one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men' and the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is demeaning and serves to disrespect and subordinate them
