# Horizontal Separation of Powers

## A. State-State Relationships

* Full Faith and Credit (Article IV, Section 1)
  * Requires states have to respect the "public acts, records, and judicial proceedings" of every other state
* Privileges and Immunities (Article IV, Section 2)
  * All citizens *in* a state are entitled to the same privileges and immunities as the citizens *of* that state
  * Protects fundamental rights of individual citizens and restrains state efforts to discriminate against out-of-state citizens
* Dormant Commerce Clause (Implicit in the Commerce Clause)
  * Prohibition against states passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce (can't discriminate against out-of-staters)
  * Prevention of protectionist state policies that favor state citizens or businesses at the expense of non-citizens conducting business within that state
  * Example: A state tax on a good must apply equally to locally-produced and imported goods

## Topics in Horizontal Separation of Powers

* **The Administrative State**
  * Nondelegation Doctrine
    * Can't delegate legislative powers to non-legislative entities (e.g. administrative agencies)
    * Congress is able to work around this by creating statutory schemes with gaps that it leaves to be filled be regulatory agencies
  * Presidential Control of the Federal Bureaucracy
    * Occurs mostly through appointment and removal powers
* **The Scope of Presidential Power**
* **Presidential Immunities**

### Key Trends and Takeaways Had We Spent More Time on This Subject

1. Massive expansion of presidential power via other actors (Congress, the Courts) from the New Deal era onwards
1. Changes in Horizontal S.o.P.
   * As manifested in Federalist No. 51, intent of the structure of our government was for "ambition to counter ambition". The objectives and motivations of each branch would act as a check on the others
   * However, there has been a growing trend of the displacement of these checking power, partially due to increased levels of partisanship in all 3 branches

1. Judiciary takes a decided back seat on these issues
   * Has become increasingly inclined to issue decisions that are under-enforcing/deferential to other branches
   * Using standing or political question doctrine to decline adjudicating these issues and allowing other branches to hash it out
